VLia Addadi\u2019s laboratory is interested in a wide range of questions related to the formation of crystals and other aggregated phases deposited in organisms, either fulfilling a physiological function, or pathologically induced. We study the interactions and cross talk between the crystals and the biological environment, spanning several orders of magnitude from the molecular level to the cell and tissue level. We aim at unraveling the strategies and design principles of the mineralized tissues, investigating them from their formation pathways (in foraminifera, sea urchin spicules and zebrafish bone) to the architecture (in dinoflagellates and mollusk shells) and finally to structure-function relations. We are currently particularly interested in how organisms manipulate light through complex crystalline architectures in plant leaves, in fish scales, crustacean cuticles and invertebrate eyes. Discovering similar pathways in widely different organisms raises fascinating questions about how common solutions have evolved. Relevant to atherosclerosis, we study how cholesterol crystals nucleate and grow from lipid bilayers and cell membranes, developing into atherosclerotic plaques. Relevant to osteoporosis, we investigate how osteoclasts recognize, adhere to and resorb bone.Lia Addadi\u2019s laboratory is interested in a wide range of questions related to the formation of crystals and other aggregated phases deposited in organisms, either fulfilling a physiological function, or pathologically induced.

VAeppli\u2019s scientific research is currently focused on the applications of nanotechnology and photon science to biomedicine and quantum information processing. Projects include the development of optical and microwave tools for medical diagnostics and pharmacology, where we are interested in new drug-target and antibody-antigen binding assays. We pay particular attention to obtaining specific, quantitative results, as well as to ease of use and (eventual) low cost for our engineered systems. Photons are also at the heart of efforts to control and read out quantum states in solids, including especially silicon, for which we exploit coherent, tunable pulses of THz radiation from a free electron laser. Our most recent work (2015) describes the electrical detection of coherent orbital superpositions in a commercial silicon wafer. A related topic is adiabatic quantum computing, where calculations are performed by mapping problems onto networks of bits, and then relaxing the networks via quantum mechanics. This procedure is most easily modeled in the limits of very large networks using magnets (although programmable medium size networks containing of order 1000 bits are now being implemented using superconducting junctions), where the bits correspond to Ising spins with either up or down magnetization, and quantum mechanics is introduced via a \u201ctransverse\u201d field, which allows tunneling between the up and down states.Aeppli\u2019s scientific research is currently focused on the applications of nanotechnology and photon science to biomedicine and quantum information processing.

VAgol's research focusses on 3-dimensional topology, principally the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. One main theme is the interaction of topology and geometry, and the study of 2-dimensional surfaces sitting in 3-dimensional spaces. He resolved the tameness conjecture of Marden (and by implication the Ahlfors measure conjecture), which was independently resolved by Danny Calegari and David Gabai. In 2012, he announced the solution of the virtual Haken and virtual fibering conjectures (partly in joint work with Daniel Groves and Jason Manning). The resolution of these conjectures followed from a conjecture of Dani Wise in geometric group theory regarding cube complexes and word-hyperbolic groups (in the sense of Mikhail Gromov), and made extensive use of the techniques of Wise and his collaborators.Agol's research focusses on 3-dimensional topology, principally the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

VManindra Agrawal started his research by investigating the structure of NP-complete sets, particularly the Isomorphism Conjecture which states that all NP-complete sets are isomorphic to each other under polynomial time computable isomorphisms. After a series of papers on this problem, he proved the conjecture for an interesting subclass of NP-complete problems: sets complete under reductions computable by constant depth circuits. His interest then moved on to computational number theory and algebra where he initiated a new approach for primality testing which culminated in the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the problem. In the last decade or so, he has worked primarily on Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem: to check if a polynomial, given as a sequence of addition and multiplication operations, is non-zero. He has contributed to showing the fundamental importance of this problem to the quest of finding an explicit polynomial that requires exponential number of operations to compute. He has also been working on finding efficient algorithms for solving PIT.Manindra Agrawal started his research by investigating the structure of NP-complete sets, particularly the Isomorphism Conjecture which states that all NP-complete sets are isomorphic to each other under polynomial time computable isomorphisms.

VI am a neuroscientist who studies the brain biology of emotions. This involves uncovering genetic, molecular, and developmental mechanisms that control brain circuits that mediate both negative and positive affect. We have developed models in rodents to define the genetic and developmental bases of differences in temperament (inborn tendencies for anxiety vs. novelty seeking). We have defined the implications of these genetic differences in reacting to environmental conditions including responsiveness to stress and propensity for anxiety and addictive behaviors. This basic research complements our human work in the context of the Pritzker Research Consortium. In humans, we rely on genetic and genomic approaches to discover molecules that contribute to vulnerability to mood disorders-- Major Depression and Bipolar Illness. An example of this integrative approach is our discovery that the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family is highly altered in the brains of severely depressed individuals. Our follow-up animal studies show that FGFs, known to orchestrate brain development, also play a lifelong role in controlling mood and emotions. They are both genetic predisposing factors and mediators of environmental impact on emotionality. Altering them during early development or in adulthood has profound effects on anxiety, depression and substance abuse, and initiates the remodeling of brain circuits critical to these behaviors. FGF downstream mediators represent new targets for developing anti-anxiety and anti-depressant drugs.I am a neuroscientist who studies the brain biology of emotions.

VDr. Alitalo is best known for his work on oncogenes and mechanisms of angiogenesis. He discovered lymphangiogenesis its regulation by growth factors, receptors and signaling mechanisms. He has isolated and characterized several tyrosine kinases including the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie1, which is related to the Tie2 receptor for angiopoietins and implicated in tumor angiogenesis. He cloned the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-3, purified and cloned its ligand VEGF-C, and showed that the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 pathway is required for angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. He was also central in the cloning and characterization of the VEGF-B. His laboratory is curerntly studying its function as a coronary vascular growth factor and metabolic regulator in the heart. Studies in his laboratory have demonstrated VEGF-C induced tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, intralymphatic tumor growth, and VEGF-C association with tumor metastasis and its inhibition by blocking the VEGFR-3 signal transduction pathway. The inhibitors of these pathways from his laboratory have now entered phase I clinical trials. He is also interested in molecular therapies for lymphedema, which are entering clinical trials. Recent work in his laboratory heve also led to studies of the homeobox transcription factor Prox1 in colon carcinoma stem cells and tumor progression.Dr. Alitalo is best known for his work on oncogenes and mechanisms of angiogenesis.

VSince joining IBM in 1957 with a Masters Degree in Mathematics, I have been working on the design and construction of compilers and programming languages for high performance computers. The goal is to bridge the gap between problem specifications and computer solutions so as to enable programmers and domain experts to be more productive and computer solutions to be faster and more precise. For more than 50 years advances in programming languages, software systems, computer designs and hardware components have enabled stunning advances in the problem-solving capabilities of high performance computing. However one of the main drivers of performance, the number of transistors/chip, hit a fundamental performance limit that was definitively identified in 2003. So how to continue achieving hardware-driven performance advances? The answer: multicores. These simpler, more flexible, hardware building blocks can be linked in multiple ways and performance achieved by parallelism. But how are problems specified so the performance potential of parallelism is utilized? The task of bridging this gap is considered the biggest problem Computer Science has ever faced! I agree. Having led a successful research project on automatic parallelization of programs, I am now giving lectures on the problem and possible solutions.Since joining IBM in 1957 with a Masters Degree in Mathematics, I have been working on the design and construction of compilers and programming languages for high performance computers.

VAs a geneticist and cell biologist I study the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis and the consequences of their failure on cell physiology. We use the budding yeast S. cerevisiae to study the final stages of mitosis and showed that this cell cycle transition is controlled by the protein phosphatase Cdc14. Our studies on the regulation of Cdc14 activity have served as a paradigm for how the activity of a protein is regulated by its changes in subcellular localization. In our work on the meiotic divisions, we investigate how regulators of the mitotic cell cycle are employed during meiosis to bring about the specialized meiotic cell cycle program.As a geneticist and cell biologist I study the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis and the consequences of their failure on cell physiology.

An and his group pioneered Chinese loess and environment studies in the 1980s. Around 1990 An proposed the \u201cpaleomonsoon control theory\u201d which hypothesized that East Asian environmental changes since the late Cenozoic were largely controlled by monsoon variations. An also pioneered the identification of proxies to determine the history, variability, and driving forcings of the East Asian monsoon within a global context. He has extended this exploration to the dynamics of the Indian monsoon, as well as studies of monsoon variability at global scale, by integrating the data of monsoons and paleomonsoons, and helping the understanding of the science of monsoon systems for a range of timescales. He has also carried out sustantial research on the sustainable development of the Loess Plateau and western China, and on urban air pollution control.

VI have applied bacteriology and simple chemistry to development of vaccines against bacterial infections of infancy, particularly bacteria in which the capsular polysaccharide (CP) interferes with phagocytic clearance. Antibody to CP is protective, but the immune response to CP matures slowly. Along with other workers, I researched conjugation of CP to immunogenic carrier proteins, permitting early-life antibody induction. My approach was used for the first "conjugate" vaccines licensed for 2-month-old infants against meningitis and other life-threatening infections by haemophili, meningococci, and pneumococci. The substantial decline in Haemophilus disease prompted the 1996 Lasker Clinical Award and Pasteur Award to JB Robbins, R Schneerson, DH Smith, and me. Pneumococcus infections of infancy are prevalent and deadly in third-world settings, but conjugate vaccines are too expensive for nations most afflicted. Since 1996 I have worked with R Malley, reviving an inexpensive alternative consisting of killed bacteria--technology readily transferable to developing-world manufacturers. This was protective in preclinical testing, partly through an unexpected antibody-independent, CD4+ T lymphocyte-dependent mechanism, mediated through pro-phagocytic activity of the cytokine IL17A and attributable to TLR agonists within the vaccine. Approval for clinical testing is being sought.I have applied bacteriology and simple chemistry to development of vaccines against bacterial infections of infancy, particularly bacteria in which the capsular polysaccharide (CP) interferes with phagocytic clearance.

This was protective in preclinical testing, partly through an unexpected antibody-independent, CD4+ T lymphocyte-dependent mechanism, mediated through pro-phagocytic activity of the cytokine IL17A and attributable to TLR agonists within the vaccine. Approval for clinical testing is being sought.

VAndrei employs magneto-transport, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, to elucidate the electronic properties of graphene and other 2-dimensional materials, and how they are affected by external perturbations such as magnetic field, charge impurities, boundaries and substrate materials. For example she and her group demonstrated that by suspending graphene so as to leave it unattached to a substrate it is possible to access the intrinsic properties of its unusual charge carriers. This led to the observation of the so called "fractional quantum Hall effect", providing a direct manifestation of unexpectedly strong electron- electron correlations in this material. In 2009, the AAAS journal Science cited these findings in its list of the year's 10 groundbreaking scientific achievements. Another example is the discovery by Andrei and her group of so-called "Van Hove singularities" in the band structure of stacked graphene layers. They showed that by superposing graphene layers so that their relative crystal orientation is twisted away from equilibrium it is possible to change in a controlled way the band structure, a property which is usually considered to be intrinsic to the chemical composition and crystal structure of a material.Andrei employs magneto-transport, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, to elucidate the electronic properties of graphene and other 2-dimensional materials, and how they are affected by external perturbations such as magnetic field, charge impurities, boundaries and substrate materials.

VNancy Andrews\u2019 laboratory is interested in mammalian iron homeostasis and its disruption in human diseases. Through positional cloning of the affected genes in classical rodent mutants with anemia, her group identified the first mammalian transmembrane iron transporter and demonstrated its importance in intestinal iron absorption and red blood cell differentiation. They characterized a second transmembrane iron transporter that releases iron from cells and showed that insufficiency of a peptide that regulates that transporter is fundamentally important in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder. They proposed that diminished cellular iron export plays a major role in the anemia of inflammation and, with others, confirmed that hypothesis. Starting with a patient that Andrews treated, her group identified the gene responsible for a disorder that they named iron-refractory iron deficiency (IRIDA). Recently, the Andrews lab has determined new roles for the classical transferrin receptor, suggesting that iron and the transferrin receptor may have relevance to a variety of diseases that have not generally been considered iron disorders.Nancy Andrews\u2019 laboratory is interested in mammalian iron homeostasis and its disruption in human diseases.

She and her colleagues investigate how multisensory information flows between subcortical and cortical brain areas and how internal states modulate this information flow. They use innovative approaches to explore and understand neural dynamics and network coding of multi-sensory and multi-modal information at multiple stages of processing under diverse naturalistic and perceptual contexts related to navigation, planning and perceptual decisions. They are interested in the neural implementation of canonical neural computations and how they go astray to result in sensory, motor, memory and cognitive deficits in diseases like autism and schizophrenia. Their goal is to use this knowledge to understand computational principles of disease, to inspire artificial systems, to aid the development of tools for understanding and treating deficits of sensory coding, spatial orientation, cognition and action.Dora Angelaki specializes in the neural mechanisms of spatial perception and spatial navigation, and how they impact complex cognitive behavior.

VA major focus of research in the Anseth group is the development of biomaterial scaffolds with highly-controlled architectures and chemistries for three-dimensional cell culture, tissue regeneration, and biological arrays and/or assays. We are particularly interested in understanding how cells receive information from materials and what happens to cell function over time when assembled within three-dimensional microenvironments. Our approach exploits classical engineering principles and modeling, as control is required on many times scales, from seconds to months, and on many size scales, from the molecular to macroscopic. Our methods include the design of passive biomaterial niches that simply permit cells to function, as well as bioactive environments that dynamically promote or suppress specific cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. Our research spans the spectrum of fundamental studies to better understand the role of the biomaterial environment on cell function and the biology of tissue formation to targeted clinical applications in the design of in situ forming cell carriers that promote healing. Further, we use these materials to develop innovative techniques to characterize and screen cell-material interactions, rapidly detect biological molecules through controlled surface chemistries, and develop models to study cellular pathology.A major focus of research in the Anseth group is the development of biomaterial scaffolds with highly-controlled architectures and chemistries for three-dimensional cell culture, tissue regeneration, and biological arrays and/or assays.

VMy work has been driven by two of the central mysteries in fundamental physics. (1) The union of quantum mechanics and gravity suggests that the notion of spacetime is approximate and must be replaced by more primitive principles, and there are related indications of fundamental limitations to quantum mechanics in both the early and late universe. These clues hint that both space-time and quantum mechanics will come to be thought of as emerging from more basic physical and mathematical ideas. I have been studying these issues in the context of scattering amplitudes ingauge theories and gravity, which give a theoretical playground where aspects of these questions can be sharply posed, while connecting directly to the experimental program of collider physics. (2) Meanwhile, we do not have a good answer to an incredibly simple question: why is the universe big, with big things in it? Indeed the existence of our macroscopic universe appears to be wildly incompatible with increasingly violent quantum fluctuations at short distances. Long-held theoretical prejudices centered about this mystery have been shattered by the two great experimental discoveriesof the accelerating universe, and a Higgs particle unaccompanied by other new physics at the Large Hadron Collider. Over ten years ago I pursued a different approach to these problems that amongst other things (successfully) predicted the mass of the Higgs particle to lie in a narrow range, and I continue to pursue this and other new approaches to the deceptively simple question \u2013 \u201cWhy is there a macroscopic universe?\u201d.My work has been driven by two of the central mysteries in fundamental physics.

VJames Arthur works in the area of mathematics called automorphic representations. These objects date back to the nineteenth century, but in recent years have come to occupy a central place in mathematics known as the Langlands program. The conjectures of Robert Langlands that define the program are still largely unresolved. Roughly speaking, they assert that concrete spectral data wrapped up in automorphic representations govern fundamental processes from quite different domains of mathematics. One of the primary tools for analyzing automorphic representations has been a complex trace formula that relates this spectral data to various kinds of geometric data. It was introduced in special cases by Selberg in 1956, and was then established for general groups by Arthur over the later period from 1975 to 2000. Arthur has used the trace formula to classify certain automorphic representations and establish some cases of the Langlands conjectures. He is now working on the central premise of the Langlands program known as the principle of functoriality.James Arthur works in the area of mathematics called automorphic representations.

VAshtekar\u2019s group developed the theory of quantum Riemannian geometry that lies at the foundation of Loop Quantum Gravity. It describes 'atoms of geometry'. Space-time can be visualized as a fabric that is woven by one-dimensional quantum threads. Thanks to this specific microscopic description, the big bang of general relativity is tamed and replaced by a big bounce. Consequently, there are no infinities and one can study the very early universe unambiguously. This theory has been developed in detail, shown to make predictions that are borne out by the cosmic microwave background missions, and has also made predictions for future observations. It brings out an unforeseen relation between the very small and the very large. Ashtekar and his team have also analyzed global problems in general relativity. They developed the notion of quasi-local horizons that is widely used in numerical simulations of black hole collisions, as well as in the investigations of the quantum mechanical evaporation of black holes. On another front, they have shown that the presence of a cosmological constant introduces unforeseen issues in the theory of gravitational waves and constructed a framework to address them. In broad terms, these diverse projects explore the interface of physics and geometry.Ashtekar\u2019s group developed the theory of quantum Riemannian geometry that lies at the foundation of Loop Quantum Gravity.

VAslin uses a variety of techniques to study how young infants, children, and adults learn from structured stimulus materials created in the lab to control for many extraneous variables that are present in naturally occurring stimuli.  His research on implicit mechanisms of learning, devoid of reinforcement or feedback, established a general approach that has been called statistical learning because it entails sensitivity to the distributional properties of perceptual input.  Using eye-trackers to study how attention is allocated to visual and auditory input, Aslin has documented the remarkably ability of infants to learn the underlying structure of information, to anticipate upcoming information, and to combine difference sources of information.  He has also used neuroimaging techniques to reveal which areas of the infant and adult brain are activated during statistical learning.  His studies of language processing in infants, children, and adults have revealed remarkably sophisticated abilities to discriminate speech sounds, adapt to new speech categories, segment words from fluent speech, recognize the meanings of words, and form grammatical categories.  His studies of visual learning have uncovered powerful mechanisms for extracting new features that are combined to form a hierarchy of representations for both familiar and novel objects and scenes.Aslin uses a variety of techniques to study how young infants, children, and adults learn from structured stimulus materials created in the lab to control for many extraneous variables that are present in naturally occurring stimuli.  His research on implicit mechanisms of learning, devoid of reinforcement or feedback, established a general approach that has been called statistical learning because it entails sensitivity to the distributional properties of perceptual input.  Using eye-trackers to study how attention is allocated to visual and auditory input, Aslin has documented the remarkably ability of infants to learn the underlying structure of information, to anticipate upcoming information, and to combine difference sources of information.  He has also used neuroimaging techniques to reveal which areas of the infant and adult brain are activated during statistical learning.  His studies of language processing in infants, children, and adults have revealed remarkably sophisticated abilities to discriminate speech sounds, adapt to new speech categories, segment words from fluent speech, recognize the meanings of words, and form grammatical categories.  His studies of visual learning have uncovered powerful mechanisms for extracting new features that are combined to form a hierarchy of representations for both familiar and novel objects and scenes.Aslin uses a variety of techniques to study how young infants, children, and adults learn from structured stimulus materials created in the lab to control for many extraneous variables that are present in naturally occurring stimuli.  His research on implicit mechanisms of learning, devoid of reinforcement or feedback, established a general approach that has been called statistical learning because it entails sensitivity to the distributional properties of perceptual input.  Using eye-trackers to study how attention is allocated to visual and auditory input, Aslin has documented the remarkably ability of infants to learn the underlying structure of information, to anticipate upcoming information, and to combine difference sources of information.  He has also used neuroimaging techniques to reveal which areas of the infant and adult brain are activated during statistical learning.  His studies of language processing in infants, children, and adults have revealed remarkably sophisticated abilities to discriminate speech sounds, adapt to new speech categories, segment words from fluent speech, recognize the meanings of words, and form grammatical categories.  His studies of visual learning have uncovered powerful mechanisms for extracting new features that are combined to form a hierarchy of representations for both familiar and novel objects and scenes.

VPhaedon Avouris\u2019 research interests involve primarily the understanding of the relation between electronic structure and the electrical and photonic properties of carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and graphene and their possible use in novel electronic and photonics technologies. The work involves experiments and theoretical modeling, as well as the fabrication and study of model devices. This work led to the first carbon nanotube field effect transistors, logic gates, integrated electronic circuits and photon detectors. Similar results were achieved based on graphene, including the development of GHz high frequency transistors, integrated circuits, infrared detectors and plasmonic devices. Earlier work focused on the behavior of molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Avouris used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) to image on the atomic scale how chemical reactions take place at metal and semiconductor surfaces and study the factors that determine the reactivity of surface sites. He also used the STM to manipulate individual atoms and molecules at surfaces.Phaedon Avouris\u2019 research interests involve primarily the understanding of the relation between electronic structure and the electrical and photonic properties of carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and graphene and their possible use in novel electronic and photonics technologies.

VBailey-Serres is interested in genetic mechanisms that underlie the ability of plants to thrive in frequently challenging environments. Her research ranges from the study of individual genes and their function to processes of signal transduction and gene network regulation, critical for strategies that enable survival under extreme unfavorable conditions, particularly floods and droughts. A key interest is in understanding how plant cells perceive, transduce, and ultimately respond to oxygen deprivation and re-oxygenation, whether a consequence of environmental or developmental factors. In her research, natural genetic variation and functional genomics are paired to explore plasticity in metabolism and development that enable successful growth under stress and recovery conditions in crops and model species. The research integrates studies of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation with an emphasis on mRNA turnover, sequestration and translation in specific organs and individual cell-types. The overall goal of these investigations is to identify and understand mechanisms that enable sustained crop production despite extremes in water availability, thereby alleviating pressures caused by climate change and enhancing global food security.Bailey-Serres is interested in genetic mechanisms that underlie the ability of plants to thrive in frequently challenging environments.

In the physical domain, they have shown that a persistence principle enables infants to realize, from a very early age, that objects continue to exist when hidden. Infants\u2019 skeletal framework also guides their acquisition of physical knowledge, via an explanation-based learning process: Infants learn about simple events by identifying the features that are causally relevant for predicting how the events will unfold. In the psychological domain, Baillargeon\u2019s laboratory has shown that infants are capable of attributing to agents sophisticated mental states such as false beliefs and deceptive intentions to implant false beliefs. Infants then use these mental states, together with a principle of rationality, to predict agents\u2019 actions. In the biological domain, their research has shown that infants identify novel self-propelled and agentive entities as animals and, in accordance with an \u201cinnards\u201d principle, expect them to have filled insides.

VSteven Balbus\u2019s research interests span a broad range of topics in theoretical astrophysics. Early work included investigations of heating and cooling processes in the interstellar medium and gasdynamical processes in spiral galaxies. Since the early 1990\u2019s Balbus has been studying turbulence in accretion disks in many different astrophysical environments. How the Keplerian gas flow in such disks degenerates into turbulence, as observations strongly imply, had been a major problem in astrophysics. In a series of papers starting in 1991, Balbus and J. Hawley showed that the presence of any weak magnetic field in a rotating gas leads to a rapid instability, if the rotation rate of the gas decreases radially outwards. This is a much less stringent requirement than the classical Rayleigh criterion that the specific angular momentum decrease outwards. Subsequent computer simulations revealed the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and the field of numerical accretion disk studies began. Balbus developed these ideas further, showing how weak magnetic fields profoundly affect the stability of dilute plasmas yet more generally. He has made important contributions to the theory of the Sun\u2019s internal rotation, and has recently ventured into a very different field: how palaeozoic ocean tides may have influenced vertebrate evolution.Steven Balbus\u2019s research interests span a broad range of topics in theoretical astrophysics.

Balbus is a native of Philadelphia, PA. He took undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and completed a PhD in theoretical astrophysics at UC Berkeley in 1981. After postdoctoral positions at MIT and Princeton, Balbus joined the faculty of the University of Virginia in 1985. He moved to the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris in 2004, where he was Professor of Physics, Classe exceptionnelle and was awarded a Chaire d\u2019excellence for his research on accretion disks.

VBaldwin is distinguished by having integrated the advances in molecular biology into the study of ecological interactions to catalyze a change in how ecologists examine ecological interactions and falsify hypotheses and by having integrated the whole-organismic expertise of ecologists into the study of gene function. In this research program, Baldwin and colleagues regularly use a nature preserve in the Great Basin Desert to conduct experiments with genetically modified Nicotiana attenuata plants in the plant's native environment to understand the genes that matter for survival in the rough and tumble of nature. The genetic transformations, and the molecular biological and chemical characterizations of the plants occurs at the Max-Planck Institute in Jena, while the field releases are conducted at the Lytle Ranch Preserve, which is owned and operated by the Brigham Young University. The research program has uncovered how plants resist (via direct and direct defenses), tolerate (by changing source-sink relationships) and escape (by changing pollinator systems) attack from herbivores, responses which are all elicited by the plant's perception of insect-specific elicitors introduced into wounds while feeding, in addition to how plants optimize pollination services, establish opportunistic mutualisms with soil bacteria and use their circadian clock to anticipate important ecological events.Baldwin is distinguished by having integrated the advances in molecular biology into the study of ecological interactions to catalyze a change in how ecologists examine ecological interactions and falsify hypotheses and by having integrated the whole-organismic expertise of ecologists into the study of gene function.

VIan Baldwin's interests in biology, chemistry and molecular biology were nucleated by inspiring mentors at the Boy's Latin School (Frank Collins), Dartmouth College (Jack Schultz), and Cornell University (Thomas Eisner, Jerrold Meinwald, Paul Feeny) and nurtured by many supportive colleagues during his pre- and post-tenure time at the State University of New York, Buffalo. In 1996, he was blessed with the opportunity to start the Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany with 3 outstanding colleagues (Boland, Gershenzon and Mitchell-Olds), and in 2002, with colleagues from the Friedrich Schiller University, the International Max-Planck Research School. With dedicated colleagues in his Department of Molecular Ecology, he is training a new generation of whole-organismic biologists (genome-enabled field biologists) with 42 fledged doctoral students to date.  Many blue-collar jobs (as fish cleaner, logger, mechanic, truck driver) provided useful skills that provided balance to equally important cultural and analytical skills from an academic upbringing in Baltimore, by two medieval history professors, John Baldwin and Jenny Jochens. These skills are regularly refreshed during his annual stays at the field station.

VThe Baran laboratory is committed to identifying areas of chemical synthesis that can have a dramatic impact on the rate of drug discovery and development. This is achieved both through the development of practical total syntheses of complex natural products and by inventing reactions which can dramatically simplify retrosynthesis. Within the former area, the lab has advocated for and demonstrated how systematically aiming for \u201cideal\u201d synthesis pathways can dramatically simplify routes to a variety of molecules in alkaloid, terpene, and peptide classes. This has been accomplished through a systematic use of C\u2013H functionalization logic, deliberate avoidance of protecting groups, and strategic consideration of molecular redox states. In the latter area, focus has been on the invention of new tools (reagents and methods) that can be widely adopted by the largest body of practicing biomedical scientists, namely those in pharmaceutical industry. Of particular interest are methods for the construction of medicinally relevant C-C, C-O, C-N, C-B, and C-X bonds directly from minimally functionalized starting materials such as olefins, carboxylic acids, or simply exposed and innately reactive C\u2013H bonds.The Baran laboratory is committed to identifying areas of chemical synthesis that can have a dramatic impact on the rate of drug discovery and development.

VFor his research, Edouard Bard has used techniques of analytical chemistry to determine the extent and the timing of climatic variations. New quantitative methods have enabled him and his team to reconstruct past climates using varied archives such as oceanic sediments, lake sediments, corals, stalagmites and polar ice. His guiding principle has been the wish to study the same climatic phenomena, for example the glaciations, using complementary and often innovative geochemical techniques. In order to go back into the past, he has employed \u201ctime machines\u201d - i.e. complex mass spectrometers to measure radioactive isotopes and thus date the climatic variations imprinted in the various archives. Over the last thirty years, the main contributions by Edouard Bard are related to the following topics: diffusion in the ocean of carbon dioxide radiolabelled by thermonuclear radiocarbon measured by accelerator mass spectrometry, paleotemperature fluctuations of the surface ocean by means of isotopic proxies and biomarkers in marine sediments, sea level variations by applying the uranium-thorium mass spectrometry to date ancient coral reefs, past conditions at the ocean-atmosphere interface by using radiocarbon as a paleo-tracer, calibration of the radiocarbon dating method and use of other cosmogenic nuclides such as beryllium 10 to constrain past changes of the solar activity, geomagnetic field and the carbon cycle.For his research, Edouard Bard has used techniques of analytical chemistry to determine the extent and the timing of climatic variations.

He earned his master degree in 1985 from the geological engineering school at Nancy (ENSG) and his doctoral degree in 1987 from the University of Paris 11-Orsay. He conducted research in Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory as a postdoctoral fellow in 1988 and as an Associate Research Scientist in 1989. He then returned to France, joined first the Commissariat à l\u2019Energie Atomique (CEA), and then started teaching as a professor at the University of Aix-Marseille in 1991 and at the Collège de France since 2001. His various studies are at the interface of climatology, oceanography and geology. The essential objective is to understand the natural functioning of the ocean-atmosphere system on time scales ranging from a few decades to several million years. Indeed, the variations of the climate involve mechanisms with very different time-constants. It is thus necessary to have a long-term perspective in order to distinguish the respective impacts of geological, astronomical and anthropogenic forcings.Edouard Bard has the Professor Chair in Climate and Ocean Evolution at the Collège de France and his laboratory is located in Aix-en-Provence.

VBonnie Bartel\u2019s research group has contributed to understanding of auxin metabolism and microRNA functions and currently investigates the biogenesis, functions, and degradation of peroxisomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The growth hormone auxin controls virtually all facets of plant development. Bartel\u2019s laboratory identified enzymes releasing auxin from precursors, discovered compartmentalization of auxin production in the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, and revealed the importance of different auxin sources during seedling development. Their discovery of a peroxisome-based pathway of auxin biosynthesis led her to explore the biogenesis, functions, and dynamics of this vital organelle. Peroxisomes compartmentalize critical metabolic reactions, thereby protecting the cytosol from oxidative damage. Through isolating and characterizing a suite of peroxisome-defective Arabidopsis mutants, Bartel\u2019s group has discovered organelle import factors, essential interdependencies among biogenesis components, and degradative pathways that control organelle remodeling.Bonnie Bartel\u2019s research group has contributed to understanding of auxin metabolism and microRNA functions and currently investigates the biogenesis, functions, and degradation of peroxisomes in Arabidopsis thaliana.

VMy lab studies RNAs that regulate gene expression in animals, plants and yeast. We were among those to find that animals have many microRNAs, which are ~22-nt RNAs that specify gene repression by base-pairing to messages of protein-coding genes. We then found miRNAs in plants and have been developing increasingly reliable methods for identifying the regulatory targets of microRNAs in both plants and animals. Using these methods, we uncovered the widespread scope of microRNA-mediated regulation in animals, providing compelling evidence that most human genes are regulated by microRNAs. Our genome-wide approaches are also showing that miRNAs primarily act to decrease target mRNA levels, and experiments following-up on individual targeting interactions are revealing biological functions of microRNA action, such as how microRNAs play critical roles in plant development and how the interaction between a human microRNA and one of its regulatory targets helps prevent human cancers.My lab studies RNAs that regulate gene expression in animals, plants and yeast.

VResearch in the Bass laboratory is focused on understanding the biological functions of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsRNA binding proteins (dsRBPs). Viruses were once thought to be the sole source of long dsRNA, but the Bass laboratory has identified numerous long dsRNAs that naturally exist in animals, primarily focusing on C. elegans and mammals. Proteins that recognize dsRNA are not sequence-specific, and the Bass laboratory is interested in how these proteins distinguish endogenous and viral dsRNA, as well as how endogenous dsRNA-mediated pathways coexist. Their studies indicate dsRNA-mediated pathways intersect and compete for dsRNA substrates. For example, altered levels of the dsRBP ADAR, an RNA editing enzyme, or altered levels of dsRNA, alters the levels of the small RNAs produced by the dsRBP Dicer. In addition to molecular biology, bioinformatics, and in vivo studies in C. elegans and mammalian cells, the Bass laboratory relies on biochemistry studies for insight. Biochemical studies of Dicer revealed that the ends, or termini, of dsRNA are important for its recognition, possibly providing a way to distinguish viral and cellular dsRNA. Biochemical and structural studies of ADAR revealed inositol hexakisphosphate as an essential cofactor.Research in the Bass laboratory is focused on understanding the biological functions of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsRNA binding proteins (dsRBPs).

VBates explores a wide range topics associated with the structure and properties of polymers and related soft materials. The thermodynamics and phase behavior of block polymers, polymer blends and polymer solutions are addressed using light, x-ray and neutron scattering, and various real-space imaging techniques including electron microscopy. Melt state dynamics are probed with rheological tools while solid state properties including elasticity, ductility and fracture are explored by mechanical testing, often in conjuncture with scattering methods. Block polymers self-assemble into myriad ordered and disordered morphologies with nanoscale dimensions. The Bates group investigates how macromolecular architecture influences the formation of low symmetry periodic crystals and aperiodic quasicrystals using model block polymer compounds synthesized in his laboratory. Mixtures of block polymers and homopolymers result in the formation of a host of morphologies including bicontinuous microemulsions. Amphiphilic block polymers self-assemble into micelles and vesicles in solution, which have myriad applications including drug delivery and modification of cell membranes. His group pursues new avenues for making sustainable plastics and elastomers through the use of biologically sourced monomers and innovative approaches to recycling.

His laboratory has discovered new macromolecular complexes essential for protein folding and degradation and has contributed in a major way to our understanding of the structure and function of the proteasome. While using a broad array of methods ranging from genomics and proteomics to biochemistry and biophysics, electron microscopy plays a particularly important role in the repertoire of methods in the Baumeister laboratory. His group had, and continues to have, a pioneering role in the development of cryoelectron tomography which is now widely seen as a method of unique potential for visualizing macromolecular complexes in their functional cellular context (in situ structural biology). It holds great promise for bridging the divide that hitherto exists between molecular and cellular structural studies. Currently, the Baumeister laboratory develops correlative light microscopy - electron microscopy approaches as well as new micromachining tools for frozen hydrated samples enabling them to study complex cellular landscapes in unprecedented detail.Wolfgang Baumeister's research is focussed on the cellular pathways of protein quality control.

VSteve Baylin\u2019s laboratory group, for over 30 years has worked to define the origins and role of epigenetic abnormalities in tumorigenesis following their recognition of abnormal gene promoter DNA methylation in cancer in 1986. Their studies include discovering the involved genes and their pathway functions in tumor initiation and progression including Baylin serving as the Co-PI for the epigenetics group in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. From 2000 to 2010, his group identified epigenetically silenced genes co-operating with mutations to over-activate key oncogenic pathways such as the WNT pathway and defined that master regulators of embryonic development constitute the preponderance of genes undergoing promoter hyper-methylation in cancer. Most recently, they are uncovering a link, including recruitment of the protein complexes involved between stress-induced DNA damage integral to cancer risk states and triggering of the above hypermethylation in cancer. Baylin\u2019s team clinically translates their basic findings especially in the context of his role as a co-leader of a Stand Up to Cancer Team. These efforts encompass taking pre-clinically derived basic concepts directly to epigenetic therapy trials for patients and development of correlative biomarkers to predict and monitor therapeutic efficacies. The studies now emphasize that that DNA demethylating agents potentially enhance immune checkpoint therapy through upregulating endogenous retroviral transcripts, triggering an interferon inducing pathway involved with sensing cytoplasmic, dsRNA (\u201cviral mimicry\u201d). This concept now underlies multiple clinical trials aimed at use of epigenetic therapy to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy for multiple common cancer types.Steve Baylin\u2019s laboratory group, for over 30 years has worked to define the origins and role of epigenetic abnormalities in tumorigenesis following their recognition of abnormal gene promoter DNA methylation in cancer in 1986.

VOur laboratory studies ion channels, the molecules underlying neuronal electrical excitability. Our main goal is to understand how the dozens of different types of ion channels expressed in mammalian neurons work together to produce the very different patterns of neuronal firing characteristic of different kinds of neurons. To do this, we use both brain slices and acutely dissociated neurons to record patterns of action potential firing and then use the voltage clamp technique to characterize the kinetics of the underlying ion channels, using pharmacological agents or genetically-modified animals to separate currents from distinct types of channels. We are particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that underlie spontaneous firing of neurons in the absence of sensory or synaptic input. We are also interested in pathophysiological conditions that result in hyperexcitability of neurons, a phenomenon implicated in a number of diseases, including epilepsy, chronic pain, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We are attempting to develop new pharmacological agents to treat some of these conditions.Our laboratory studies ion channels, the molecules underlying neuronal electrical excitability.

VOur laboratory is studying the role of epigenetics and de novo and inherited mutations in human disease with particular emphasis on genomic imprinting and its role in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS), and autism. Genomic imprinting is the phenomenon of differential expression of the two alleles at an autosomal locus based on their parent of origin; usually one allele is expressed and the other silenced. PWS and AS are distinct human disorders characterized by neurobehavioral abnormalities and intellectual disability. They are caused by deficiency of paternally (PWS) or maternally (AS) expressed genes within chromosome 15q11-q13. Our laboratory has contributed to identification of molecular defects causing PWS and AS, identified the UBE3A locus encoding E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase as the AS gene, and made numerous mouse models related to PWS and AS. The molecular findings in PWS and AS and evidence that genomic imprinting of 15q11-q13 also plays a role in autism have led us to propose a mixed epigenetic and genetic and mixed de novo and inherited (MEGDI) model for oligogenic inheritance of autism. This proposes a radically different model with recent or new mutations in one or a few major genes causing autism in any one individual. This is in contrast to the widely held hypothesis that many genes with ancient mutations cause autism through a multilocus epistasis model. The lab is also focused on the use of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect novel mutations causing intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent results suggest that deletions of chromosome 15q13 cause a phenotype of intellectual disability, autism, schizophrenia, and aggressive behavior. This has led to detailed genotyping for the CHRNA7 gene which maps to 15q13.3 and encodes a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which we believe is important in genetic causes of neurobehavioral disorders. Very recently, we discovered a novel inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis caused by deficiency of the X-linked TMLHE gene. This deficiency is present in 1 in 350 control males and is a risk factor for autism. This has led us to hypothesize that neuronal carnitine deficiency may play a broader role in non-dysmorphic autism, and that some forms of autism may be preventable or treatable through dietary supplementation with carnitineOur laboratory is studying the role of epigenetics and de novo and inherited mutations in human disease with particular emphasis on genomic imprinting and its role in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS), and autism.

VMarlene Behrmann's laboratory is interested in the psychological and neural mechanisms that underlie visual processing. Despite the paucity of input from the retina (roughly amount and wave length of light), humans can recognize visual scenes and their content with remarkable ease, speed and accuracy. To elucidate the mechanisms by which this is achieved, Behrmann adopts a multiplicity of research methods including neuroimaging and electrophysiology, along with detailed psychophysics in normal and brain-damaged (stroke, trauma) individuals, as well as in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, face blindness).  For example, Behrmann\u2019s lab has characterized the neural circuit associated with face processing, as well as the structural connectivity between the nodes, and has elucidated the neural code associated with identifying individual faces. Behrmann and colleagues have also documented the interactivity between disparate parts of the visual system, namely the ventral temporal structures and the dorsal parietal structures, and its emergence over the course of development. In addition, Behrmann\u2019s lab has provided empirical support and a theoretical account, using computational approaches, for the processes that govern the organization of the two cerebral hemispheres in adult humans and the developmental trajectory by which this neural profile emerges.Marlene Behrmann's laboratory is interested in the psychological and neural mechanisms that underlie visual processing.

To elucidate the mechanisms by which this is achieved, Behrmann adopts a multiplicity of research methods including neuroimaging and electrophysiology, along with detailed psychophysics in normal and brain-damaged (stroke, trauma) individuals, as well as in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, face blindness).  For example, Behrmann\u2019s lab has characterized the neural circuit associated with face processing, as well as the structural connectivity between the nodes, and has elucidated the neural code associated with identifying individual faces. Behrmann and colleagues have also documented the interactivity between disparate parts of the visual system, namely the ventral temporal structures and the dorsal parietal structures, and its emergence over the course of development. In addition, Behrmann\u2019s lab has provided empirical support and a theoretical account, using computational approaches, for the processes that govern the organization of the two cerebral hemispheres in adult humans and the developmental trajectory by which this neural profile emerges.

Bell discovered the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), the protein complex that identifies eukaryotic origins of replication and his lab has characterized the functions of this complex and used its genomic binding sites to identify origins of replication in multiple organisms. His lab pioneered methods to monitor association of replication proteins with the DNA in cells to identify components of the replication fork and the proteins involved in loading a key protein required for DNA replication, the replicative DNA helicase, at origins of replication. Their studies have contributed to understanding the mechanisms that ensure the genome is replicated only once per round of cell division.

VThe goal of my research program is to understand how organs develop. Most of our work uses the root of Arabidopsis as a tractable model system. We initially used molecular genetic approaches to identify a set of genes that are key regulators of the radial organization of the root. One of these regulators is a transcription factor that physically moves from its site of synthesis in the internal vascular tissue to its site of activity in the adjacent tissues. There it interacts with another transcription factor to turn on a suite of target genes including a component of the cell cycle machinery, which controls a critical asymmetric cell division. We have exploited the simple organization of the root to generate the most comprehensive genome-wide RNA expression map of an organ for any species. We have shown that the response to abiotic stresses is frequently highly cell-specific. Most recently, we identified a clock-like process that generates a wave of gene expression in the root tip and determines the competence to form branch roots.The goal of my research program is to understand how organs develop.

VI have had a longstanding love affair with plasma membranes, beginning with my PhD research with Pedro Cuatrecasas. Postdoctoral training with Dan Branton introduced me to the human erythrocyte as a window into the world's simplest and most accessible plasma membrane. My laboratory used the erythrocyte model to discover ankyrin and its role in connecting the anion exchanger to the spectrin skeleton. We subsequently found that ankyrins and spectrins are ubiquitously expressed. Our laboratory has characterized ankyrins -B and -G and resolved their role in organization of a surprisingly diverse set of proteins and membrane domains. Ankyrins and their partners play pervasive roles in vertebrate physiology including recent evolutionary adaptations such as fast signaling in the nervous system and heart. We have determined a simple "code" for ankyrin-binding by membrane proteins, that has been independently accessed by many protein families. We have found that ankyrin proteins are required for both localization of membrane partners as well as for formation of specialized membrane domains including axon initial segments of neurons and lateral membrane domains of epithelial cells. We currently are exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying ankyrin function as well as the pathological consequences such as cardiac arrhythmia and diabetes when these mechanisms fail.I have had a longstanding love affair with plasma membranes, beginning with my PhD research with Pedro Cuatrecasas.

VDuring development, all multicellular organisms face a similar set of challenges: they must create a diverse set of specialized cell types, organize these cells into functional tissues, and maintain pools of stem cells to replenish the tissues throughout their lifetimes. My group uses the development of plant stomata (the epidermal structures that regulate CO2 and water vapor exchange between the plant and atmosphere) as a model to understand how tissues integrate signals from a variety of sources into decisions about cell fate, cell signaling and cell polarity. By incorporating a variety of plants in our studies we found that a core set of conserved regulators underlie stomatal development, and that much of diversity in stomatal forms and patterns we see in nature stems from rewiring of interactions among these core regulators. Stomata also provide a framework to study the fundamental processes of plants at different organizational levels, from molecules and cells to whole plants and ecosystems. Collectively, the activities of billions of stomata on thousands of plant species contribute to global biosphere/atmosphere exchange. In collaboration with ecophysiologists, we have used tools derived from our molecular-scale studies to improve organismal-scale models for photosynthetic activity and provide experimental evidence that evolutionarily conserved stomatal patterns are essential for efficient photosynthesis.During development, all multicellular organisms face a similar set of challenges: they must create a diverse set of specialized cell types, organize these cells into functional tissues, and maintain pools of stem cells to replenish the tissues throughout their lifetimes. My group uses the development of plant stomata (the epidermal structures that regulate CO2 and water vapor exchange between the plant and atmosphere) as a model to understand how tissues integrate signals from a variety of sources into decisions about cell fate, cell signaling and cell polarity. By incorporating a variety of plants in our studies we found that a core set of conserved regulators underlie stomatal development, and that much of diversity in stomatal forms and patterns we see in nature stems from rewiring of interactions among these core regulators.

VMy laboratory is interested in defining the genetic aberrations that are critical for lung tumor development. Genetically engineered mouse models are used to unravel the specific mechanisms of action of the various lesions found in lung cancer in man. The tumor subtypes we are focusing on are: small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and mesothelioma. We induce tumor development by genetic activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The specific questions we try to answer: 1. What is the cell-of-origin of these tumors? Can different cell types in lung give rise to similar tumors? Do they retain specific features of their cell-of-origin? 2. Can we identify better intervention strategies? Do genetic screens in cell lines in vitro (transposon and Crisp/Cas9 mutagenesis) yield actionable targets that subsequently can be validated in autochthonous mouse models? 3. To what extent does the genetic background influence tumor development? Can we identify alleles of unaltered germline genes that synergize with oncogenic lesions in facilitating tumor development? 4. Do the observations made in the mouse models have a corollary in cognate human tumors and can this information be used for designing better intervention strategies?My laboratory is interested in defining the genetic aberrations that are critical for lung tumor development.

VBeverley's laboratory has focused on the introduction of modern concepts of microbial pathogenesis and molecular genetics into the study of protozoan parasites of humans, primarily the trypanosomatid Leishmania.  Studies of drug resistance, extra-chromosomal gene amplification and transcription led to the development of the first transfection system enabling both forward and reverse genetics, and have been widely adopted in the field.  Beverley's lab has put them to use in dissecting the role of major parasite surface glycoconjugates in parasite survival in both mammalian and insect hosts, immune recognition and evasion, identification of novel pathways of folate and pteridine metabolic amenable to chemotherapeutic attack, and the use of genetically modified parasites as safe live vaccine lines.  Modified parasites also provide therapeutic opportunities for use as live nanoplatforms for delivery of therapeutic proteins, an approach pursued by a company Beverley co-founded.  Leishmania genetic methods continue to evolve, including the use of imported mariner transposons, conditional gene expression, RNA interference, and genetic crossing (which occurs only in the sand fly vector).  Beverley spearheaded an NIHGRI/AID project for trypanosomatid genome sequencing which has led to comprehensive coverage of the genomes of diverse Leishmania species manifesting widely varying severity in humans, and key outgroups relevant to the origins of vertebrate parasitism.  Studies of RNA interference have led to the question of why most species of Leishmania have lost this vital pathway in evolution, and the potential role of transposable elements and RNA viruses.  Remarkably, the dsRNA virus LRV1 dramatically increases the severity of leishmaniasis, perhaps providing a driving force for RNAi loss, but also providing new opportunities for understanding parasite virulence and the role of 'endosymbiontic' viruses in biology and as potential targets for therapeutic interventions.Beverley's laboratory has focused on the introduction of modern concepts of microbial pathogenesis and molecular genetics into the study of protozoan parasites of humans, primarily the

VThe focus of Sangeeta Bhatia\u2019s research is on the development of novel micro- and nanoscale platforms for understanding, diagnosing, and treating human disease. While cell autonomous processes certainly influence the balance between health and disease, the laboratory\u2019s focus is on interactions between cells and their microenvironment. They leverage micro- and nanotechnology tools that have been created by the semiconductor community, which, by virtue of their spatial resolution, enable the precise synthesis, interrogation, and perturbation of tissue microenvironments. Specifically, they focus on tissue microenvironments of clinical importance in hepatology and oncology. In the area of hepatology, they are interested in liver tissue engineering - both for treating patients with cell-based therapies and for developing more predictive in vitro models of human disease. In the oncology field, they leverage the physical traits of nanomaterials to improve the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. The Bhatia group endeavors to translate their inventions and scientific findings to patients, and to advocate for diversity in science and engineering.The focus of Sangeeta Bhatia\u2019s research is on the development of novel micro- and nanoscale platforms for understanding, diagnosing, and treating human disease.

VBest known for contributions to our understanding of coding and computation in the brain, Bialek and collaborators have shown that aspects of brain function can be described as essentially optimal strategies for adapting to the complex dynamics of the world, making the most of the available signals in the face of fundamental physical constraints and limitations. He has followed these ideas of optimization into the early events of embryonic development, and the processes by which all cells make decisions about when to read out the information stored in their genes. In earlier work he explored the interface between quantum and classical dynamics in enzymes and in the initial events of photosynthesis. Recently he and his colleagues have shown how the collective states of biological systems -- the activity in a network of neurons, or the flight directions in a flock of birds -- can be described using ideas from statistical physics, connecting in quantitative detail with new experimental data. Most generally, he would like to know if there are theoretical principles that have the power and generality that we have come to expect in physics, yet encompass the full complexity and diversity of life's most beautiful phenomena.Best known for contributions to our understanding of coding and computation in the brain, Bialek and collaborators have shown that aspects of brain function can be described as essentially optimal strategies for adapting to the complex dynamics of the world, making the most of the available signals in the face of fundamental physical constraints and limitations.

VAdrian Bird has studied the biological and biomedical significance of DNA methylation. He introduced the use of restriction enzymes to map patterns of methylated CpG sites in genomic DNA. This led to the recognition that \u201cCpG islands\u201d - non-methylated CpG-rich genomic domains - are associated with the promoters of most mammalian genes and could be used as markers for early gene-discovery in mammalian DNA. The Bird laboratory later described a family of proteins with an affinity for the methyl-CpG sequence and demonstrated that several can mediate transcriptional repression. MeCP2 was the first methyl-CpG binding protein to be purified and was shown to recruit a transcriptional corepressor complex to DNA, providing a mechanistic connection between two different epigenetic marks \u2013 DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The report by others that mutations in the MECP2 gene cause of the autism spectrum disorder Rett Syndrome (RTT) led Bird to pursue the molecular basis of this disorder. His group created a convincing mouse model of RTT and established, unexpectedly, that the resulting severe neurological phenotype is reversible. Both terminally ill Mecp2-null males and chronically symptomatic heterozygous females lost all RTT-like signs, suggesting that this is potentially a curable disorder.Adrian Bird has studied the biological and biomedical significance of DNA methylation.

VThe fundamental questions we have addressed in my laboratory are: How tissue-specificity is maintained and how these processes go awry in cancer. Early work (70s) on Warburg effect indicated that it is the rate of glucose uptake that regulates rates of glycolysis in normal and transformed cells and that pattern of glucose metabolism was tissue-specific. Work in the 80s indicated that the context determines whether a potent oncogene is oncogenic or whether it could coexist within a normal host. Work in the 80s and 90s indicated that both malignant and normal cells are plastic and dependent on their microenvironment. We could "revert" malignant human breast cells in 3-dimensional extracellular-matrix (ECM) gels (an assay we developed in 1989 for mice mammary and in 1992 for human breast cells). Conversely we could make normal mice develop tumors by destroying the mammary structure by metalloproteinases in engineered mice. We thus established that: 1-ECM signals to tissue-specificity, 2-context matters, 3-phenotype is dominant over genotype, and 4- tissue structure is the ultimate regulator of tissue-specificity. Current work concentrates on the mechanism(s) of "dynamic reciprocity" (a model we proposed in 1982) between how the microenvironment signals and in return receives signals from the chromatin and the nucleus.The fundamental questions we have addressed in my laboratory are: How tissue-specificity is maintained and how these processes go awry in cancer.

VBlau's research challenged the long-held view that the differentiated state is fixed and irreversible by demonstrating that previously silent genes could be activated in human cells. Using a heterokaryon cell fusion system, her laboratory showed that the differentiated state requires continuous regulation and is controlled by the balance of regulators (transcription factors) present in a cell at any given time, principles fundamental to the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Her laboratory now capitalizes on the unique potential of the heterokaryon system to capture early and transient epigenetic and transcriptional events critical to reprogramming to pluripotency (iPS). Blau\u2019s laboratory has discovered that telomeres protect mice from cardiac diseases due to heritable defects in contractile proteins, such as dystrophin. The underlying mechanisms of telomere shortening and approaches to telomere elongation are a current major research focus. Blau\u2019s laboratory developed a means of manipulating the microenvironment by creating bioengineered niches to enhance muscle stem cell function. This platform has enabled the elucidation of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that diminish stem cell function with aging and muscular dystrophy. Her lab has discovered therapeutic strategies to rejuvenate the aged muscle stem cell population that enhance regeneration and restore strength to injured muscles in the elderly.Blau's research challenged the long-held view that the differentiated state is fixed and irreversible by demonstrating that previously silent genes could be activated in human cells.

Using a heterokaryon cell fusion system, her laboratory showed that the differentiated state requires continuous regulation and is controlled by the balance of regulators (transcription factors) present in a cell at any given time, principles fundamental to the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Her laboratory now capitalizes on the unique potential of the heterokaryon system to capture early and transient epigenetic and transcriptional events critical to reprogramming to pluripotency (iPS). Blau\u2019s laboratory has discovered that telomeres protect mice from cardiac diseases due to heritable defects in contractile proteins, such as dystrophin. The underlying mechanisms of telomere shortening and approaches to telomere elongation are a current major research focus. Blau\u2019s laboratory developed a means of manipulating the microenvironment by creating bioengineered niches to enhance muscle stem cell function. This platform has enabled the elucidation of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that diminish stem cell function with aging and muscular dystrophy. Her lab has discovered therapeutic strategies to rejuvenate the aged muscle stem cell population that enhance regeneration and restore strength to injured muscles in the elderly.

VJef Boeke elucidated one of the major forms of DNA movement (transposition) in yeast cells, in which Ty1 elements move via reverse transcription of RNA.  He coined the term retrotransposition to describe the process, which is common in virtually all eukaryotic genomes. His genetic and biochemical studies helped elucidate intricate molecular mechanisms involved in retrotransposition in yeasts, mammalian cells and mice. The Boeke laboratory has also constructed highly active synthetic retrotransposons as a probe of retrotransposition in cells and mice. Retrotransposition formed about half of all human DNA and has been a major force in genome evolution.  Another current interest is exploration of the frequency and impact of ongoing retrotransposition in the human germ line, somatic cells, and cancer.  In the area of Synthetic Biology, Jef Boeke is using yeast as a platform for exploring the construction of fully synthetic chromosomes for practical and theoretical studies.

VDale Boger is recognized for his work in organic synthesis, natural products total synthesis, synthetic methodology development, medicinal chemistry and has made seminal contributions to improving the glycopeptide antibiotics, to understanding the DNA-binding properties of naturally occurring antitumor-antibiotics, to probing protein-protein interactions, and to the discovery of new biological targets (e.g. FAAH). Most notable are his use of the hetero Diels-Alder reaction in syntheses of complex natural products, the development of cyclopropenone ketal cycloaddition reactions, the use of alkene addition reactions of acyl radicals, macrocyclization technology, an Fe(III)-mediated hydrogen atom transfer free radical functionalization of unactivated alkenes, and solution-phase combinatorial chemistry. Applications of this methodology in his natural products total syntheses are chosen based on their important biological properties. The most notable are CC-1065 and duocarmycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and vancomycin. They made the unusual observation that both enantiomers of CC-1065 and the duocarmycins constitute effective DNA alkylating agents, defined their DNA alkylation selectivity, identified a remarkable source of catalysis for the DNA alkylation reaction, defined structural features contributing to functional reactivity, and delineated their impact on biological properties. Similarly, his group was the first to extend their total synthesis of the glycopeptide antibiotics to redesigned vancomycins to address vancomycin resistance.Dale Boger is recognized for his work in organic synthesis, natural products total synthesis, synthetic methodology development, medicinal chemistry and has made seminal contributions to improving the glycopeptide antibiotics, to understanding the DNA-binding properties of naturally occurring antitumor-antibiotics, to probing protein-protein interactions, and to the discovery of new biological targets (e.g. FAAH).

VI have worked on diverse aspects of the ecology and evolution of plant life but the central theme is the exploration of the ecology, biogeography and evolution of open (shade-intolerant) ecosystems. I am intrigued by shrublands, grasslands and savannas growing in climates capable of supporting closed forests. Palaeoecological and phylogenetic studies have revealed surprisingly ancient origins for the biota that constitute open ecosystems, surprising because they are often assumed to be produced by felling and burning of forests by people. My colleagues and I have explored both physical and biotic controls on the distribution of these systems using a variety of tools, from remote sensing and physiologically-based global vegetation models, to field studies and glasshouse experiments. Fire, herbivory, soils, and atmospheric chemistry (especially changing CO2), interact within a climate setting to determine the proportions of open versus forested vegetation. Because they are only indirectly influenced by climate, these ecosystems may show rapid and unexpected responses to changing disturbance regimes or to CO2-induced changes in the ability of plants to respond to fire, herbivory, or drought.  Recognition of the large global extent of open ecosystems, and a greater appreciation of the sensitivity of the major growth forms to biotic and physical controls, has implications for land management and global change policy at local, regional and global scales.I have worked on diverse aspects of the ecology and evolution of plant life but the central theme is the exploration of the ecology, biogeography and evolution of open (shade-intolerant) ecosystems.

VDr. Boothroyd is fascinated by the interaction of an infectious agent and the host it infects. His entry into this field came with his joining a collaborative effort to understand antigenic variation in Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African Sleeping Sickness. His group went on to co-discover mRNA trans-splicing and polycistronic transcription in these single-celled eukaryotes. For about the past 25 years, he and his collaborators have been immersed in studying the pathogenesis of another single-celled eukaryote, Toxoplasma gondii. Unlike the African trypanosomes, this ubiquitous cousin of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, can only grow within another cell. His current work is focused on asking: (1) how Toxoplasma invades and co-opts almost any cell type from almost any warm-blooded animal; (2) how the parasite persists in the human host; 3) how it introduces a collection of polymorphic \u201ceffectors\u201d into a host cell; and 4) how these varied effectors produce different disease severity in the host, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal.Dr. Boothroyd is fascinated by the interaction of an infectious agent and the host it infects.

VSam Bowring is a geologist interested in using U-Pb geochronology to constrain the rates of geologic processes and to calibrate the timing of significant events in the geologic record.  His unwavering pursuit of the highest possible capabilities in U-Pb geochronology has allowed him to investigate the explosion of multi-cellular life in the Early Cambrian \u2013 the single most important evolutionary event in Earth history \u2013 and to examine the mechanisms of the most significant catastrophic events in the history of life: the end-Permian and the end-Cretaceous mass extinctions. His relentless efforts as a field geologist in the Northwest Territories of Canada led to an understanding of the processes involved in the early growth of continental crust recorded in the 4 billion-year-old Acasta gneisses. Bowring\u2019s interests also extend to environmental applications of tracer isotopes using the isotopic composition of Pb, Sr, and U in natural waters to examine the fate and transport of contaminants.Sam Bowring is a geologist interested in using U-Pb geochronology to constrain the rates of geologic processes and to calibrate the timing of significant events in the geologic record.  His unwavering pursuit of the highest possible capabilities in U-Pb geochronology has allowed him to investigate the explosion of multi-cellular life in the Early Cambrian \u2013 the single most important evolutionary event in Earth history \u2013 and to examine the mechanisms of the most significant catastrophic events in the history of life: the end-Permian and the end-Cretaceous mass extinctions.

VMy research in probability theory mainly involves models from interacting particle systems, stochastic networks, and branching processes. Most of these models are motivated by phenomena or problems arising in mathematical physics, mathematical biology, engineering, and computer science. This includes the study of Gaussian free fields and the rate of decrease of the particle density for certain particle systems; the study of particle systems such as voter models and the contact process that are motivated by the movement of populations and spread of disease; and the study of the stability and large scale behavior of queueing networks, which includes the paradoxical behavior of queueing networks with slower input than service, which nonetheless may be unstable.My research in probability theory mainly involves models from interacting particle systems, stochastic networks, and branching processes.

VNumerous structured RNAs remain to be discovered that are derived from the noncoding portions of the genomes of cells from all three domains of life. Many of these RNAs will prove to function as novel riboswitches that respond to essential metabolites or other ligands. Breaker seeks to discover and validate the functions of riboswitches to reveal otherwise hidden regulatory networks. Since some riboswitches control the expression of essential genes in bacteria, he and his research team is exploring the possibility of creating new classes of antibacterial compounds that target RNAs. In some instances, the newfound RNAs are unusually large and appear to represent novel classes of ribozymes. Since the known ribozyme classes carry out critical biochemical functions such as protein synthesis and RNA processing, these new ribozyme candidates will allow us to broaden the known repertoire of natural enzymes made of RNA.Numerous structured RNAs remain to be discovered that are derived from the noncoding portions of the genomes of cells from all three domains of life.

VMarianne Bronner\u2019s laboratory has a long-standing interest in the central question of developmental biology:  how a complex organism develops from a single cell.  Her studies center on the molecular mechanisms underlying formation and evolution of the neural crest, a highly multipotent stem cell population that gives rise to melanocytes of the skin, craniofacial skeleton and peripheral ganglia.  Many of these cell types are prone to metastasis in the adult, for example contributing to melanoma and neuroblastoma, and these cancers often possess transcriptional signatures similar to those of embryonic neural crest cells. A major focus is the identification of the signaling and transcriptional interactions that lead to neural crest formation both at the tissue and the molecular level.  Using a multiorganismal approach, their studies have combined gain- and loss-of-function approaches with genome-wide transcriptome profiling and regulatory analysis.  This has led to the discovery of a neural crest gene regulatory network that is largely conserved to the base of vertebrates.  As neural crest cells are amongst the most migratory cell type in vertebrate embryo, the Bronner lab also has been interested in characterizing the role of the migratory environment in influencing pathway choice.Marianne Bronner\u2019s laboratory has a long-standing interest in the central question of developmental biology:  how a complex organism develops from a single cell.  Her studies center on the molecular mechanisms underlying formation and evolution of the neural crest, a highly multipotent stem cell population that gives rise to melanocytes of the skin, craniofacial skeleton and peripheral ganglia.  Many of these cell types are prone to metastasis in the adult, for example contributing to melanoma and neuroblastoma, and these cancers often possess transcriptional signatures similar to those of embryonic neural crest cells.

VFrom various material remains recovered archaeologically Brown studies the social processes that created evolutionary change in low-density part-time agriculturalists of the eastern United States. Examples include the rise of population aggregation centers with massive earthworks at different times and places. Specifically, Mound City (OH), Cahokia (IL) and Spiro (OK) have been the subject of detailed analyses to reveal the ritual practices, including the treatment of the dead, that index the social and political factors that made these locations of particular importance at specific times. Current interest has been engaged in the identification of specific social processes that continue through long periods of time and leave their imprint on such topics as settlement aggregation, food production, institution building, craft production, and image production.From various material remains recovered archaeologically Brown studies the social processes that created evolutionary change in low-density part-time agriculturalists of the eastern United States.

VBrown uses ground and space based telescopes to both conduct wide-field surveys to discover new objects in our solar system and to perform detailed investigation of individual members of our solar system. He was involved in the discovery of most of the largest objects in the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune, including Eris, the most massive dwarf planet, the discovery of which eventually led to the demotion of Pluto, and Sedna, still the only know member of the region of space beyond the Kuiper belt. In addition to discovering these objects, Brown and his group provided the first analyses of the characteristics and properties of this group of bodies, leading to insights into giant impacts in the outer solar system, loss of atmospheres on dwarf planets, radiation processing of volatile ices, and the formation of dwarf planets. In addition he has studied planetary processes on satellites of the giant planets, including global circulation in Titan's atmosphere, the chemistry of Europa's ocean, and the effects of Io's volcanoes on Jupiter's magnetosphere.Brown uses ground and space based telescopes to both conduct wide-field surveys to discover new objects in our solar system and to perform detailed investigation of individual members of our solar system.

Using mouse molecular genetics, I have focussed on the formation of skeletal and cardiac muscle. We first studied contractile protein genes, and then investigated the upstream gene hierarchies that control the onset of skeletal myogenesis.

Our studies on skeletal muscle extend to regeneration in the adult, where we have demonstrated the major role of the muscle satellite cell in response to injury or degenerative disease.

VBull currently works on (i) the use of phages and phage products to treat bacterial infections, (ii) the engineering of viral genomes to achieve long term attenuation that will not revert to high virulence, and (iii) evolution of resistance to gene drive systems. The phage work uses a combination of purely in vitro studies with E. coli, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, and others to discover how best to suppress bacterial numbers with phages. Mouse infections are used to test treatment efficacy, both with phages and enzymes derived from phages. The engineering of attenuation is also done with phages, where the goal is to suppress viral fitness and then subject the engineered phages to long term growth, observing whether fitness recovers. Some genomic designs lead to effectively permanent attenuation, such that the virus would not be able to recover original fitness levels. The work on evolution of resistance to gene drive systems is in its infancy and is so far limited to population genetics models to predict the various ways that a population may evolve in response to a gene drive system that harms the population.Bull currently works on (i) the use of phages and phage products to treat bacterial infections, (ii) the engineering of viral genomes to achieve long term attenuation that will not revert to high virulence, and (iii) evolution of resistance to gene drive systems.

VI am a field geologist with a focus on tectonic geomorphology and the interactions among climate, erosion, and tectonics. I attempt to quantify landscapes, geologic structures, and the sedimentary record in order to reconstruct the growth and decay of mountain belts. My primary focus is on young, collisional mountain ranges, such as the Himalaya, the Tien Shan, or the Southern Alps of New Zealand, where strong climatic contrasts, rapid erosion and deformation, and high degrees of spatial and temporal variability permit interactions among these forcing functions and responses to be teased apart. Through use of new techniques and data sets, such as reliable remote-sensing of global rainfall, high-resolution digital topography, and cosmogenic nuclide dating, my group and collaborators have succeeded in quantifying rates of erosion, rainfall, and fault slip at time scales ranging from years to many millennia. These studies have served to define the extent to which temporal or spatial variability in erosion rates is driven by corresponding climatic variability, how landscapes and erosional processes change in response to different rates of tectonic uplift, and whether the addition or removal of loads due to erosion or deposition affects rates of tectonic deformation.I am a field geologist with a focus on tectonic geomorphology and the interactions among climate, erosion, and tectonics. I attempt to quantify landscapes, geologic structures, and the sedimentary record in order to reconstruct the growth and decay of mountain belts. My primary focus is on young, collisional mountain ranges, such as the Himalaya, the Tien Shan, or the Southern Alps of New Zealand, where strong climatic contrasts, rapid erosion and deformation, and high degrees of spatial and temporal variability permit interactions among these forcing functions and responses to be teased apart.

VAdam Burrows' major research interests include the theories of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and supernovae.  In the realms of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, his major focus is on their evolution, spectroscopy, and atmospheres, with particular emphasis on understanding their structures, chemistry, and spectral signatures in aid of the numerous international campaigns of discovery and characterization. He was one of the first exoplanet theorists in the world, having explored the properties of giant exoplanets in advance of their first detection in 1995. In the general realm of supernovae, he investigates the theories of their explosions and the associated computational, neutrino, and gravitational-wave astrophysics, along with their X-ray and $\u005cgamma$-ray signatures. Much of his supernova research is also in support of ongoing efforts to understand the origins of neutron stars, pulsars, and stellar-mass black holes, as well as the elements of Nature.  In the subjects of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and supernovae, he has written numerous influential papers and reviews, has collaborated with more than 300 co-authors on more than 350 research papers, and has given more than 300 invited talks and colloquia.Adam Burrows' major research interests include the theories of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and supernovae.  In the realms of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, his major focus is on their evolution, spectroscopy, and atmospheres, with particular emphasis on understanding their structures, chemistry, and spectral signatures in aid of the numerous international campaigns of discovery and characterization.

VCynthia Burrows leads a research team investigating the chemical structures and mechanisms by which DNA and RNA bases, notably guanine, undergo transformations under conditions of oxidative stress. These studies underlie the biology of age-related disorders such as cancer. Inflammation, metabolism and radiation generate reactive oxygen species that alter the structure of guanine in such a way as to affect the integrity of the genome, leading to mutations in DNA and to changes in both duplex and quadruplex folding patterns. The Burrows laboratory uses the tools of organic chemistry to synthesize and characterize site-specifically modified DNA and RNA strands, allowing the study of proteins that interact with modified bases such as those involved in replication, transcription and repair. Notably, Burrows and coworkers identified hyperoxidized hydantoin lesions in DNA that are highly mutagenic and appear to play significant roles in signaling for DNA repair. Nanopore technology employed by the group has moved this field forward by providing a single-molecule method of analyzing the effects of base damage on DNA folding and opens the door to single-molecule sequencing of DNA modifications.Cynthia Burrows leads a research team investigating the chemical structures and mechanisms by which DNA and RNA bases, notably guanine, undergo transformations under conditions of oxidative stress.

VI have pursued a single-cell approach to investigate the immune system. By recording membrane current in individual T lymphocytes, my research group identified five distinctive types of ion channel and found agents that block them. Using channel blockers, we showed that specific calcium, potassium, and chloride ion channels comprise a functional network and are required during an immune response for changes in gene expression, cytokine secretion, cell proliferation, and motility; as well as controlling membrane potential, intracellular calcium levels, and cell volume homeostasis. Agents that block a specific voltage-gated potassium channel, named Kv1.3, are proving effective in treating animal models of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. My laboratory has also worked on a voltage-independent calcium channel in T lymphocytes that is triggered to open following recognition of antigen. RNA interference screening led us to the discovery of two proteins -- Stim and Orai -- that together form the molecular basis of the calcium channel. We are presently investigating how STIM proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum activate plasma membrane Orai subunits to form conducting Ca2+ channels. In addition, we are using two-photon microscopy to investigate cellular choreography in lymphoid organs and to evaluate candidate immunosuppressants in vivo.I have pursued a single-cell approach to investigate the immune system.

VEmmanuel\u2019s work lies at the interface of mathematics, statistics, information theory, signal processing and scientific computing, and is about finding new ways of representing information and of extracting information from complex data. For example, he helped launch the field known as compressed sensing, which is a mathematical technique that has led to advances in the efficiency and accuracy of data collection and analysis, and can be used to significantly speed up MRI scanning times. More broadly, he is interested in theoretical and applied problems characterized by incomplete information. His work combines ideas from probability theory, statistics and mathematical optimization to answer questions such as whether it is possible to recover the phase of a light field from intensity measurements only as in X-ray crystallography; or users\u2019 preferences for items from just a few samples as in recommender systems and/or fine details of an object from low-frequency data as in microscopy. His most recent research is concerned with the development of statistical techniques addressing the issue of the irreproducibility of scientific research (the fact that many follow up studies cannot reproduce early findings).Emmanuel\u2019s work lies at the interface of mathematics, statistics, information theory, signal processing and scientific computing, and is about finding new ways of representing information and of extracting information from complex data.

VCane continues to work on El Niño prediction, and on the impact of El Niño and climate generally on human activity, especially agriculture, health, and, most recently, conflict.  Current work aims to describe and understand the preferred natural modes of variation internal to the climate system on interannual to decadal timescales and longer.  An aspect of this work is to consider the occurrence of decadal regimes from a dynamical systems perspective with attention to their predictability. Other work focuses on the difference in the response to greenhouse gases and to natural variations in solar output and volcanic aerosol. The expression of climate variability in extended droughts is a particular focus because of their impacts on agriculture and conflict.  These topics overlap with an interest in paleoclimate problems, from the Pliocene to the last millennium, and the light they shed on future climate change.Cane continues to work on El Niño prediction, and on the impact of El Niño and climate generally on human activity, especially agriculture, health, and, most recently, conflict.  Current work aims to describe and understand the preferred natural modes of variation internal to the climate system on interannual to decadal timescales and longer.  An aspect of this work is to consider the occurrence of decadal regimes from a dynamical systems perspective with attention to their predictability.

VRoberto Car's research focuses on the electronic and atomistic structure of material and molecular systems. Car is the inventor, with Michele Parrinello, of the ab-initio molecular dynamics method that initiated a new field of numerical simulations. In this approach atomic trajectories are generated \u201con the fly\u201d from the quantum-mechanical ground state of the electrons, capturing the interplay of nuclear dynamics and chemical bond evolution. Car used this approach in groundbreaking studies of liquid and amorphous systems and to investigate temperature and pressure induced phase transitions. Recently, he focused at understanding the network of hydrogen bonds in water, its dependence on hermodynamic conditions and its role in solvation processes. He is especially interested on the consequences of nuclear quantum dynamics on the equilibrium molecular structures and on the electronic excitations and spectral properties. Car is also devoting effort to combine ab-initio simulations with coarse-grained models and advanced sampling ethodologies to study the slow relaxation processes of the hydrogen bond network that underlie ice nucleation. Two other areas of Car's research include the theory of open quantum systems and new computational schemes for electronic correlation.Roberto Car's research focuses on the electronic and atomistic structure of material and molecular systems.

VNancy Carrasco's main area of interest is transport across biological membranes, particularly by the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the key plasma membrane protein that mediates active iodide uptake in the thyroid. Carrasco's group cloned NIS and has made great strides in characterizing it at the molecular level. NIS is at the center of the treatment for thyroid cancer based on administering radioiodide post-thyroidectomy, the most effective targeted internal radiation cancer therapy ever devised. Carrasco's group has discovered that functional NIS is endogenously expressed in breast cancer, opening up the possibility that this disease too could be treated with radioiodide. Carrasco's group has investigated the function and regulation of NIS in extrathyroidal tissues and in cancer to extend the clinical use of NIS beyond thyroid disease. They have obtained key structure/function information on NIS and identified amino acid residues that play crucial roles in substrate binding, translocation, specificity, and stoichiometry, and in targeting NIS to the cell surface. They are currently using these findings to optimize NIS molecules for use as reporter and therapeutic molecules in gene transfer studies. Carrasco's group has demonstrated that NIS transports different anion substrates with different stoichiometries, and is working to elucidate the structural basis for this versatility. They have also shown that NIS actively transports the anion perchlorate, an environmental pollutant. This suggests that the health effects of exposure to perchlorate are more serious than previously thought.Nancy Carrasco's main area of interest is transport across biological membranes, particularly by the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the key plasma membrane protein that mediates active iodide uptake in the thyroid.

VNancy Carrasco, a leader in the study of membrane transporters, was the first scientist to clone and extensively characterize at the molecular level the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the key plasma membrane protein that mediates the active transport of iodide in the thyroid. Numerous scientists had sought to identify this transporter for decades, owing to its physiological and pathophysiological significance. Carrasco's pioneering findings on NIS include key mechanistic information on the protein\u2014obtained largely by determining the molecular requirements of NIS at positions bearing mutations in patients\u2014as well as the discovery that NIS transports different substrates with different stoichiometries; that it actively transports the environmental pollutant perchlorate, settling a longstanding controversy; and that it is expressed in the lactating breast and in breast cancer. Carrasco received her MD and Master's in Biochemistry degrees from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in her native Mexico City. She was a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. H. Ronald Kaback's laboratory at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology. Carrasco joined the faculty at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1987 and the Yale School of Medicine in 2011.

VThe key to high-efficiency genome editing is the creation of a highly specific DNA double-strand break in the desired genomic target. The platforms that facilitate this are the programmable nucleases: zinc-finger nucleases, TALENs and CRISPR-Cas. Investigators around the world are applying these reagents to genome manipulations for many purposes in a wide range of species, from research in model organisms, to improvement of crop plants and livestock, to medical applications in humans. Dana Carroll\u2019s laboratory investigates the design of these nucleases, their delivery to cells and organisms, the fundamental DNA repair mechanisms that process the nuclease-induced breaks, and translation of this knowledge to methods for manipulating genomic DNA sequences. There are multiple pathways of double-strand break repair, and manipulating them can enhance desired genome alterations, including new mutations, gene corrections and sequence insertions. Past work in the Carroll lab showed that disabling the dominant mutagenic pathway increases the recovery of precise corrections and insertions. Current work focuses on the role of chromatin structure in determining the efficiency of nuclease cleavage at various genomic targets.The key to high-efficiency genome editing is the creation of a highly specific DNA double-strand break in the desired genomic target.

VJean-Laurent Casanova is pediatrician and immunologist by training, and has in practice become a human geneticist investigating the immunological basis of childhood infectious diseases. He has been recognized for his paradigm\u2010shifting discoveries, demonstrating that life-threatening infectious diseases striking otherwise healthy children may be caused by single\u2010gene inborn errors of immunity, including variations underlying mycobacterial diseases (IFN\u2010\u03b3 immunity), invasive pneumococcal disease (TIR), herpes simplex virus encephalitis (TLR3), and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (IL\u2010 17).

VKathy Cashman is a volcanologist who studies volcanic systems from the magma reservoir to the Earth\u2019s surface using the combined tools of field observations and measurements, sample analysis for chemical and physical characteristics, laboratory experiments and theoretical models. The most distinctive aspect of her work is her use of all constituent phases of volcanic samples (glass, crystals and vesicles) to quantify the kinetics of phase transformations and relate these to temporal changes in the physical properties of volcanic materials. She has used this approach to study the emplacement of lava flows, conditions of magma storage and eruption, and generation of volcanic ash. One example is the combined use of melt inclusion and textural analysis to address conditions of magma storage and ascent, generally, and the role of decompression-related degassing more specifically. This work highlights the critical role of shallow water loss on crystallisation of both groundmass and phenocryst phases. From a volcanological perspective, Cashman has used these data to show that feedbacks among processes of magma ascent, degassing, crystallisation and magma rheology have important implications for both patterns of precursory behaviour and controls on volcanic eruption styles. Her work has had significant impacts in the fields of igneous petrology, physical volcanology, and magmatic processes, and has stimulated new areas of research in experimental petrology and volcano studies.Kathy Cashman is a volcanologist who studies volcanic systems from the magma reservoir to the Earth\u2019s surface using the combined tools of field observations and measurements, sample analysis for chemical and physical characteristics, laboratory experiments and theoretical models.

VThe central focus of Chakraborty\u2019s lab is to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of the adaptive immune response to pathogens, and then to harness this understanding to help design better vaccines and therapies. The work represents a crossroad of the physical and life sciences. Lab members work on developing and applying theoretical and computational approaches (rooted in statistical physics) to study the collective, dynamic, and stochastic processes that underlie a systemic immune response. A hallmark of Chakraborty\u2019s research is the close synergy and collaboration between his lab\u2019s theoretical/computational studies and investigations led by experimental and clinical immunologists. Current interests can be divided into three broad categories: understanding the network of biochemical interactions that enable T cells to translate engagement of membrane receptors to cognate ligands in to functional responses, how T cell development results in T cells that are specific for unknown and emerging pathogens, and the human immune response to HIV. The goal of the last effort is to guide the rational design of vaccines and therapies against infectious disease causing agents, like HIV, that have plagued humanity since antiquity.The central focus of Chakraborty\u2019s lab is to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of the adaptive immune response to pathogens, and then to harness this understanding to help design better vaccines and therapies.

VMy research involves understanding the molecular genetic basis of human disease, running the gamut from Mendelian to oligogenic to complex, using experimental, quantitative and animal model approaches.  My laboratory  has made fundamental contributions to studies of polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium, both their biology and as tools for trait mapping.  These mapping studies, including GWAS (genome-wide association studies) required our collaborative development of genotyping technology (with Affymetrix) and computational methods for genome-wide screens. We pioneered GWAS in autism, hypertension and sudden cardiac death, revealing a diversity of novel genes contributing to their genetics. We also have a long history of studying the population genetics of deleterious alleles in isolated communities (Old Order Mennonites, Arab Israeli villages). Of these, the most significant and continuous effort has gone towards the genetic dissection and functional understanding of Hirschsprung disease, a model complex disorder where we have made fundamental and substantive contributions to understanding how mutations in genes specifying early neural crest-derived enteroblasts and their interaction with the gut mesenchyme led to this disorder of gut innervation.

VDavid Charbonneau\u2019s research focusses on the detection and characterization of planets orbiting other stars, known as exoplanets, with the goal of studying inhabited worlds. He leads the MEarth project, which consists of two arrays of telescopes that survey the closest and smallest stars to find temperate, terrestrial worlds that pass in front of (or transit) their stars. In 2017 his team announced the discovery of the first planet that was known to be rocky, transit, and orbit within the habitable zone of a nearby small star. By studying the transmission of starlight when it passes through the atmosphere of a planet, Dr. Charbonneau and his team deduce the chemical composition of the exoplanet atmosphere. In the future, he seeks to use this method to detect combinations of gases that would indicate the presence of life. His focus on low-mass stars as exoplanet targets has also led to several discoveries concerning the physical processes by which theses stars maintain magnetic fields, and how they lose angular momentum as they age. He is a co-investigator in the NASA TESS Mission, scheduled for launch in 2018, which will search for the closest transiting exoplanets and hence the ones most accessible to detailed characterization.David Charbonneau\u2019s research focusses on the detection and characterization of planets orbiting other stars, known as exoplanets, with the goal of studying inhabited worlds.

VCharlesworth's research is in the general area of evolutionary biology.  His early work was on the theory of selection in age-structured populations.  This showed that, while there is no universal exact measure of fitness in this case, useful approximations for describing the effects of selection on life-history traits can be obtained.  He applied these results to evolutionary theories of aging, and pioneered tests of these theories, using Drosophila melanogaster as experimental material. His later work involved application of population genetics methods to studies of the evolution of many different aspects of genetic systems, including genetic recombination, inbreeding and outbreeding mechanisms, separate sexes and sex chromosomes, segregation distortion, and repetitive DNA. He contributed extensively to the theory of background selection, according to which the elimination of selectively deleterious mutations can affect patterns of molecular variation and evolution at sites that are linked to the targets of selection. He has helped to develop and apply methods for estimating selection on both coding and non-coding sequence variants within populations. He has also contributed to a variety of other topics in evolutionary biology, including kin selection theory, methods for measuring evolutionary rates from fossil data, and genetic mechanisms of speciation.Charlesworth's research is in the general area of evolutionary biology.  His early work was on the theory of selection in age-structured populations.  This showed that, while there is no universal exact measure of fitness in this case, useful approximations for describing the effects of selection on life-history traits can be obtained.  He applied these results to evolutionary theories of aging, and pioneered tests of these theories, using Drosophila melanogaster as experimental material.

VEmmanuelle Charpentier\u2019s laboratory is interested in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating physiology, virulence and infection in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Her laboratory investigates how RNAs and proteins coordinate to modulate gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level. They study regulatory RNAs and proteins in various biological pathways such as horizontal gene transfer, adaptation to stress, physiology, persistence, virulence, infection and immunity. In particular, her laboratory researches on DNA- and RNA-mediated interference systems in the defence against genetic elements (CRISPR-Cas), small regulatory RNAs that have roles in pathogenic processes, protein quality control that regulates bacterial adaptation, physiology and virulence, and the mechanisms of bacterial recognition by immune cells. A greater understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of regulation in pathogens is critical to generate new findings in basic science and possibly translate them into novel biotechnological and biomedical applications (e.g. genome editing tools, anti-infective strategies). A successful example of the application of Charpentier basic research in biotechnology and medicine is her recent discovery of an RNA-guided DNA cleavage mechanism that has been harnessed as an RNA programmable genome engineering technology and that stems from her analysis of the adaptive immune CRISPR-Cas9 system in bacterial pathogens.Emmanuelle Charpentier\u2019s laboratory is interested in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating physiology, virulence and infection in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.

Through large-scale follow-up studies, they have discovered multiple disorders caused by arsenic in drinking water and characterized dose-response relations between ingested arsenic and risk of cancers, vascular diseases, neurological disorders, hypertension, diabetes and cataract. WHO and US EPA have used their findings to set up a new maximal contamination level of arsenic in drinking water to protect health and life of hundred millions of victims. They have documented the efficacy of hepatitis B immunization to prevent fatal hepatic diseases and liver cancer, which has led to the use of vaccines, antivirals or antibiotics to prevent infection-related cancers. Their REVEAL study on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B and C has pioneered the viral load paradigm in clinical management of viral hepatitis, and has developed risk calculators through the combination of host and viral biomarkers to precisely predict long-term risk of diseases induced by oncogenic viruses.Chien-Jen Chen\u2019s research team is interested in the long-term health risk assessment and molecular and genomic biomarkers of chronic arsenic poisoning and chronic infection of oncogenic viruses.

VUsing Arabidopsis as the model, studies in the Chen lab investigate the biology of small RNAs, which are classified into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants. With genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches, they have been studying the molecular mechanisms that govern the biogenesis, degradation, and mode of action of small RNAs. They are best known for the discovery of an essential step in small RNA biogenesis - the methylation of plant miRNAs and siRNAs on their 3' terminal ribose by the small RNA methyltransferase HEN1. Subsequent studies from others show that piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are similarly methylated by HEN1 homologs in animals. Efforts to uncover the role of methylation in small RNA metabolism have led to further pioneering studies on the molecular mechanisms of small RNA degradation. They have discovered two molecular processes that degrade small RNAs and the major players carrying out these processes. These processes of small RNA turnover have also been shown to be conserved in animals. The Chen lab also studies the mechanisms of cell fate specification in plant development, and has uncovered critical roles of miRNAs in the patterning of floral organs. Recent studies have revealed subcellular partitioning of small RNAs between the cytosol and membrane compartments, and begun to implicate the endomembrane system in the activity and cell-to-cell movement of small RNAs.Using Arabidopsis as the model, studies in the Chen lab investigate the biology of small RNAs, which are classified into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants.

VDorothy Cheney\u2019s research focuses on the social behavior and cognition of wild primates, notably vervet monkeys in Amboseli National Park (1977-1988) and baboons in the Moremi Reserve, Botswana (1992-2008).

VCherlin\u2019s field of research is best described as family demography: the causes and consequences of demographic changes in the family lives of parents and children. He has written widely on this topic during a period of intense change in family life in the U.S. and the world. During the first two decades of his career, much of his research and writing focused on union formation and dissolution. His 1978 article on the lack of cultural and social support for families formed by remarriage after divorce remains the most highly-cited article on remarriage. His 1981 book, revised and updated in 1992, demonstrated that the 1950s was the most unusual period of family life in the twentieth century. In a 1991 interdisciplinary study with several collaborators, he found that a substantial share of the seeming effects of divorce on children were present before the parents separated.Cherlin\u2019s field of research is best described as family demography: the causes and consequences of demographic changes in the family lives of parents and children.

VAs a chemist, initially crystallographer, I have developed new technologies for analyzing and synthesizing large, macromolecular assemblages ranging in size from tRNAs to human genomes. Conceiving of molecular multiplexing and barcode tags in 1980 lead to the first direct genomic sequencing approach, then to automation used for the first commercial genome sequence, for the pathogen, Helicobacter in 1994. This evolved into Fluorescent In Situ Sequencing (FISSeq) in 1999, ABI-SOLiD in 2006, the only open-source device (Polonator.org) in 2007, Complete Genomics in 2008, and consumer-directed genomics (Knome, 23andme). Work on organic synthesis of oligonucleotide arrays and homologous recombination in the 1990s lead to research on synthetic, minimal, in vitro protein synthesis and photosynthetic production of alkanes from carbon dioxide (at Joule and LS9). I found that intimate early views of new technologies offered the obligation and opportunity to develop novel ethics, safety and security strategies including construction of radically new cellular genomes with genetic codes that could protect from all viruses and other genetic exchanges. Such considerations also launched the Personal Genome Project to integrate human genomic, environmental and trait data, providing the world's only IRB-approved open-access source for such data.As a chemist, initially crystallographer, I have developed new technologies for analyzing and synthesizing large, macromolecular assemblages ranging in size from tRNAs to human genomes.

VMy research is centered upon the development and application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules and their complexes in solution. Particular emphasis is being placed on novel approaches to extending NMR to larger and more complex systems, especially complexes involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation, and exploring fundamental questions associated with protein dynamics, macromolecular interactions and recognition processes. Currently we are exploiting the unique properties of NMR to detect and characterize sparsely-populated states of macromolecules. Many important biological processes proceed through transient intermediate states that comprise only a small fraction of the overall population of a molecular system at equilibrium, and, as a result, are invisible (i.e. dark) to conventional biophysical techniques (including crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and single molecule spectroscopies). These studies, which have provided new insights into macromolecular recognition, rely on the ability of NMR to amplify, through exchange phenomena, the effect of the invisible "dark" state on some NMR observable (generally a relaxation property) so that its footprint is readily observed in measurements on the NMR visible species. Examples of such phenomena that we have studied include the search processes whereby transcription factors locate their specific DNA binding site within an overwhelming sea of non-specific DNA; the role of encounter complexes in protein-protein association; the interplay of conformational selection and induced fit in protein-ligand interactions; and transient interactions of intrinsically disordered and partially folded polypeptides with large megadalton macromolecular assemblies including highly heterogeneous aggregates involved in amyloid protofibril formation.My research is centered upon the development and application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules and their complexes in solution.

VThe research focus of the Coates laboratory is the development of new catalysts for the synthesis of macromolecules as well as fine chemicals. Coates\u2019 research centers on developing new methods for reacting commodity feedstocks (such as alkenes, epoxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide) in unprecedented ways. Current research focuses on four primary themes, the first of which is the development of homogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization, heterocycle carbonylation, epoxide homo- and copolymerization, and the utilization of carbon dioxide in polymer synthesis. The second area of interest is the utilization of naturally occurring building blocks such as terpenes, saccharides, and plant-based oils for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers. A third focus area is polymer electrolytes for energy storage (batteries, supercapacitors) as well as energy conversion (hydroxide exchange fuel cells). The fourth area of investigation is the development of materials that allow more efficient recycling of commodity plastics, and promote improved properties of current commercial polymers.The research focus of the Coates laboratory is the development of new catalysts for the synthesis of macromolecules as well as fine chemicals.

VJudith Cohen is interested in using the chemical abundances of stars to infer the history of our Milky Way galaxy, the formation of the Galactic halo, and the properties of other "local" galaxies as well as those of the high-redshift Universe. She modeled the integrated light of simple stellar systems to determine their age and metallicity. Subsequently, she and her team of postdoctoral fellows pursued detailed abundance analyses of globular cluster red giant stars, as well as the very rate extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo, looking for patterns that could be used to determine the nucleosynthetic origin of the elements. This helped to establish that the trends of abundance ratios with overall metallicity can be understood in most cases by the normal nucleosynthetic processes operating in massive stars at their deaths via core collapse supernova explosions combined with ejecta from thermonuclear explosions on white dwarfs. A careful study of the stable isotopes of magnesium in dwarf stars led to a better understanding of when various nuclear reaction chains within stars each began to make significant contributions to the interstellar gas in the Milky Way. With postdoctoral fellow Jorge Melendez, she carried out the first extremely high precision detailed abundance analysis of dwarf stars, looking for evidence of planets via very small changes in the ratios of refractory to volatile elements in the host star. Her current work focuses on using RR Lyr variables to study the outer halo of our galaxy.  From roughly 1986 to 1995, she and the late J.B. Oke (professor of astronomy, Caltech) led the team that built the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph, one of the first light instruments at the Keck Telescopes, which is still very popular and in active use.Judith Cohen is interested in using the chemical abundances of stars to infer the history of our Milky Way galaxy, the formation of the Galactic halo, and the properties of other "local" galaxies as well as those of the high-redshift Universe.

VIn almost any system, microorganisms are responsible for most of the aerobic respiration and all of the anaerobic respiration. Thus, the production of carbon dioxide, methane, sulfide as well as the regeneration of other inorganic nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) is largely due to the activities of these microorganisms. I am particularly interested in the biotic and abiotic regulation of microbial metabolism, energy flow and carbon cycles in lakes, rivers and marine systems. More recently I have been working on the fates of terrestrial C in aquatic systems and the role that inland waters have on the global carbon balance). It turns out that inland waters are quite significant in both the global and regional balances of C in terms of both the storage of organic C in lake and reservoir sediments and in the oxidation of terrestrially derived organic materials. These terrestrially derived organic materials also have the potential to subsidize aquatic food webs, another area of active research for me.In almost any system, microorganisms are responsible for most of the aerobic respiration and all of the anaerobic respiration.

VJames J. Collins' laboratory is focused on using engineering principles and molecular biology techniques to model, design and construct synthetic gene networks. They have created genetic toggle switches, RNA switches, genetic counters, microbial kill switches, synthetic bacteriophage to combat resistant bacterial infections, synthetic probiotics to detect-and-treat infections, synthetic mRNA for stem cell reprogramming, and tunable mammalian genetic switches. Recently, the Collins lab developed paper-based synthetic gene networks, a technology platform that forms the basis for inexpensive, in vitro diagnostic tests (e.g., Ebola) and portable molecular manufacturing (e.g., vaccines) in the developing world. The lab's work in synthetic biology has enabled multiple biomedical applications, including in vivo biosensing, antibiotic potentiation, biofilm eradication, in vitro pathogen detection, rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing, identification of antibiotic counterfeits, drug target identification/validation, microbiome reengineering, and efficient stem cell reprogramming. The Collins lab also uses network biology approaches to study antibiotic action, bacterial defense mechanisms, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance, with the goal of utilizing the insights gained from these studies to enhance our existing antibiotic arsenal and develop novel means to treat resistant and persistent bacterial infections.James J.

VMy primary interest is the homeostatic regulation of energy stores by the central nervous system. When we cloned the melanocortin receptors and elucidated the role of the agouti proteins as endogenous antagonists of these receptors, we identified the central melanocortin circuits as a critical component of the adipostat. These circuits appear to coordinate long-term adipostatic signals with short term hunger and satiety signals, and to coordinate energy intake with expenditure. We continue to focus on the specific physiological mechanisms involved in these homeostatic processes mediated by central melanocortin signaling. For example, even haploinsufficiency of the melanocortin-4 receptor causes profound hyperphagia in response to dietary fat, and we are studying the mechanisms involved. Our work utilizes a variety of techniques and model systems to better understand these signaling pathways. We have characterized the central melanocortin circuits in the zebrafish to be able to apply unbiased forward genetics to identification of the genes involved in this system. We have recently initiated clinical studies of melanocortin obesity syndrome in children. Finally, since MC4R haploinsufficiency is the most common cause of severe obesity known, and excessive MC4R activation appears to play a role in disease cachexia, we are using high throughput screening to identify small molecule allosteric modifiers of MC4R function. These may be used to test the hypothesis that modulation of receptor activity may be used to treat disorders of energy homeostasis.My primary interest is the homeostatic regulation of energy stores by the central nervous system.

VIn recent years, the Crabtree laboratory has collaborated with a wide variety of colleagues in pursuit of answers to the tough problems posed by solar and wind energy. Their intermittancy requires some type of storage such as conversion to fuels. The Energy Sciences Institute at Yale is the focus for one aspect of the work. Here the problem is to find suitable electrically conductive or nonconductive linkers between catalysts or photosensitizers and electrode surfaces. The Main Campus work relates to developing catalysts for water splitting to oxygen and hydrogen or other fuel molecules. Other recent topics include catalytic conversion of biomass to useful products and development of hydrogen borrowing catalysts that bring about novel organic transformations. The lab contributes some of these results to the ANSER EFRC headquartered in the Chicago area and funded by the Department of Energy.In recent years, the Crabtree laboratory has collaborated with a wide variety of colleagues in pursuit of answers to the tough problems posed by solar and wind energy.

VAt Yale since 1977, Bob Crabtree is now Whitehead Professor. In early work, he reversed homogeneous catalytic alkene hydrogenation to attain the goal of alkane dehydrogenation. The so-called 'Crabtree catalyst' has proved useful for mediating certain challenging transformations and has therefore seen broad use. This was followed by work on H2 complexation to metals and finding a new type of hydrogen bond that he called the dihydrogen bond. Recently, he developed water oxidation and C-H bond hydroxylation with iridium catalysts in connection with the problem of green catalysis and alternative energy production. He has been ACS and RSC organometallic chemistry awardee, Baylor Medallist, Dow, Williams and Mond lecturer, Centenary awardee, has chaired the ACS Inorganic Division and is the author of a textbook in his field. He is a Fellow of the American Chemical Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry, the International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry and the American Academy as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences.At Yale since 1977, Bob Crabtree is now Whitehead Professor.

VOur research group is interested in mapping biochemical pathways that play fundamental roles in mammalian physiology and disease and to use this knowledge to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of human disorders. To achieve these goals, we develop and apply new technologies that bridge the fields of chemistry and biology, such as the chemical proteomic method activity-based protein profiling, which utilizes active site-directed small-molecule probes for the global analysis of enzyme function in native biological systems. We complement these efforts in technology development with focused studies on individual enzymes, in particular, enzymes that regulate chemical transmission in the nervous system, cancer, and metabolism. Notably, our enzyme characterization projects both benefit from and provide a fertile testing ground for technological innovations. Thus, through the integration of two complementary research programs, one dedicated to methods development for functional proteomics, and the other to the in-depth analysis of key signaling enzymes, our group achieves a unique balance that cultivates the creation and rapid implementation of cutting-edge technologies that address unmet needs in biomedical research.Our research group is interested in mapping biochemical pathways that play fundamental roles in mammalian physiology and disease and to use this knowledge to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of human disorders.

Her earliest work clarified trends in mortality, disability, other indicators of population health, and healthy life expectancy. Crimmins\u2019 work has also been important in clarifying how health differentials arise in the population. For instance men have a higher prevalence of heart disease than women which comes from their earlier rates of onset of heart disease; however, the length of time spent with heart disease is longer for women. Other work has shown that women\u2019s longer life with cognitive impairment comes largely from their longer life rather than from more cognitive loss at a given age. Work on race and education differences in life expectancy has shown the earlier aging of the disadvantaged through the earlier onset of health conditions among persons of lower SES leading to shorter lives, fewer healthy years, and more years of life lost or never lived. Crimmins more recent work has expanded traditional demographic approaches by integrating indicators of physiological states into analysis to determine how social and economic circumstances \u201cget under the skin.\u201dMuch of Crimmins\u2019 has focused on changes both in health and mortality both over time in populations and among individuals.

VJohn Cronan\u2019s laboratory is interested in the diversity of lipid synthetic pathways in bacteria. Although some enzymes of fatty acid synthesis are very strongly conserved, others show remarkable diversity. Unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and the last step of the canonical fatty acid synthesis cycle both show significant differences in the enzyme proteins utilized and their enzymatic mechanisms. Other interests are in the synthesis and attachment of the fatty acid-derived cofactors, biotin and lipoic acid. Multiple pathways are evident for both cofactors, although not yet clearly understood. Finally the laboratory studies the synthesis of various fatty acid containing signaling molecules used by bacterial species to coordinate gene expression in response to environmental changes.John Cronan\u2019s laboratory is interested in the diversity of lipid synthetic pathways in bacteria.

VPatricia Crown studies the production, consumption, exchange, and discard of artifacts in the past, particularly archaeological ceramics. To understand who made ceramics and how they were used, she has conducted analyses of ceramic composition and residues in collaboration with scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, the Smithsonian Conservation Analytical Laboratory, and the Hershey Company. Her dissertation research focused on the ceramics from a small pueblo occupied for about 25 years, examining variation in household inventories across the site. A post-doctoral detailed examination of Salado polychrome ceramics revealed that this widespread pottery appeared when migrant populations from the northern Southwest moved into already occupied areas, was widely produced in these areas of ethnically diverse populations, and was associated with the appearance of a belief system involving prayers for rain. An ongoing study of how children learned to make ceramics in the past compares distinct communities of practice and the sequence of learning in many different parts of the Southwest, discovering variable paths to skilled knowledge with adults often working closely with novices to teach aspects of the craft while gaining from their labor.Patricia Crown studies the production, consumption, exchange, and discard of artifacts in the past, particularly archaeological ceramics.

VChristopher Cummins\u2019 laboratory is conducting exploratory synthesis investigations aimed at reaction discovery and the uncovering of new kinds of chemical linkages and molecular structures. The synthesis of three-coordinate molybdenum(III) complexes led to the finding of N2 reductive scission. Nitric oxide deoxygenation afforded chromium(VI) nitride complexes. White phosphorus transformation by niobium complexes allowed for development of P3-transfer reactivity culminating in the synthesis of the AsP3 molecule. Methods have been developed for generation of the P2 molecule as a highly reactive, transient intermediate, leading to chlorine-free routes for phosphorus incorporation into organic molecules. P2 transfer to the azide ion gave rise to an inorganic \u201cclick reaction\u201d and provided the planar P2N3\u2212 anion, a simple aromatic species composed exclusively of phosphorus and nitrogen.

VMy laboratory studies how cells and antigens come together to generate immune responses. This involves a focus on deciphering the cues that guide immune cell movements within, and egress from, lymphoid organs. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a major class of chemoattractant receptor on immune cells and we have used gain- and loss-of function approaches to establish roles for several GPCRs that respond to protein (chemokine) and lipid (sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), endocannabinoid and oxysterol) ligands and to study how these responses adapt after exposure to antigen or inflammatory inputs. We established that lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs is mediated by S1PR1 and defined enzymatic mechanisms acting to maintain high S1P levels at egress sites. We found CD69 acts a repressor of S1PR1 and we continue to study how this and other egress regulators work. We have a strong interest in understanding how cell interaction dynamics influence the selection events underlying antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers. We use real-time intravital 2-photon microscopy procedures to study these dynamics and are working on tools for the in vivo quantitation of cell-cell interaction and cell signaling in germinal centers. We have also begun exploring requirements for barrier immunity in lymphoid organs and at epithelial surfaces. This includes an interest in the cues guiding cell positioning at these surfaces and the factors required for mounting intestinal IgA antibody responses.My laboratory studies how cells and antigens come together to generate immune responses.

VEric D'Asaro\u2019s research centers on understanding the physics of the upper ocean and its interactions with biogeochemistry. For the past 25 years, his group has designed, built and operated "Lagrangian floats", a new class of robotic oceanographic instruments that accurately follow the three dimensional motion of water parcels, particularly in regions of strong mixing. Tracing the motion of water effectively measures previously inaccessible aspects of turbulence and mixing, while also mimicking the motion of chemical species and plankton, thereby giving unique insights into their dynamics. Different problems can be addressed by equipping the floats with different sensors, and changing, through software, how they respond to their environment. Through a series of multi-investigator field campaigns targeted at specific physical and biogeochemical processes and appropriately combining the floats with other robotic instruments and ships, the group has worked to build and test quantitative models of these phenomena. These continuing efforts target air-sea interactions in hurricanes and typhoons, interactions between surface and internal waves and turbulence, submesoscale and frontal dynamics, oxygen minimum zones and the North Atlantic spring bloom.Eric D'Asaro\u2019s research centers on understanding the physics of the upper ocean and its interactions with biogeochemistry.

More recently, using genome-wide gene sequencing and gene expression analysis, his group has elucidated a more complete landscape of the genome of these malignancies. They have identified the normal function as well as the contribution to B-cell transformation of recurrently altered genes by using in vitro studies and conditional mouse models reproducing the lesions in germinal-center B cells, the normal counterpart of most B cell malignancies.

VThe well-known metals in biology on oxygen-rich Earth that govern life processes as biocatalysts in enzymes or as structural elements, are typically bound within complicated organic ligands by oxygen and nitrogen, sometimes sulfur, donors to the trace transition metal ions. As holdovers from an age when earth was under a reducing atmosphere, some enzymes in microorganisms that perform reductive reactions, contain iron, sometimes nickel, stabilized in low-valent states by simple diatomic molecules such as carbon monoxide and cyanide, and involve two metals bridged by sulfur. Marcetta Darensbourg, her group and her collaborators design, synthesize and characterize inorganic/organometallic compounds that mimic the active sites of hydrogenases; they uncover molecular features critical to structure and function of these evolutionarily perfected biocatalysts for hydrogen metabolism. Such small molecular models, even without the protein superstructure, show some activity as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, fulfilling a goal in base metal catalysis involving metal hydrides. Nature\u2019s control of the diatomics, CO and cyanide, obviates a poisoning effect on the microorganism host, and suggests their genesis on iron.

VMarcetta York Darensbourg is an inorganic/organometallic chemist whose earlier synthetic expertise and mechanistic studies of low valent transition metal hydrides have evolved into current efforts towards the development of synthetic analogues of enzyme active sites that contain metal-carbon bonds--especially the carbon monoxide- and cyanide-stabilized iron centers in hydrogenases that are known from spectroscopies and protein crystallography. Biomimetics are designed to reproduce key structural, spectroscopic and reactivity features of the natural organometallic catalysts that connect to the catalytic electrochemical mechanisms of these natural fuel cell catalysts, as well as carbon-carbon coupling processes as in acetyl-coA synthase.

VDr. Darnell is a physician scientist who has pioneered next-generation approaches to understanding RNA genomics in human disease. He is a world\u2019s expert in the study of the paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PNDs), diseases associated with cancer, tumor immunity and autoimmune brain disease. Much of the lab has focused on translational studies of the PNDs, proposing that they provide a basic approach to understanding brain specific functions co-opted by tumor cells, as well as the best documented example of naturally occurring human tumor immunity amenable to study. The lab\u2019s studies of disease mechanism, discovering PND antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in these patients, was foundational to the new field of immuno-oncology. He developed molecular approaches to understanding disease pathogenesis and discovering the presence of neuron-specific systems for RNA regulation in the brain, and developing HITS-CLIP, the gold-standard for studying RNA-protein interactions in vivo. The basic lab combined genetic approaches with biochemistry and new methods development to study RNA regulation in neurons. The lab discovered rules predicting brain-specific alternative splicing, showing the first evidence for biologic coherence of RNA regulation in vivo. This work developed into a general understanding of how genome-wide RNA-binding maps predict protein-RNA regulation, in which the position of binding determines the outcome of RNA regulation, first discovered with Nova and now found to be true for a host of RNA regulatory proteins (Nature 2006, 2008). The lab also developed Ago HITS-CLIP (Nature 2009), a precise means of pinpointing protein-RNA and miRNA-mRNA regulatory sites on a genome-wide basis, and hence a means to understand the interactions regulating RNA expression.Dr. Darnell is a physician scientist who has pioneered next-generation approaches to understanding RNA genomics in human disease.

VMy laboratory research is focused on antibiotic: their discovery, mode of action, mechanisms of resistance and their functions in the environment. With respect to resistance, we are studying the role of wastewater treatment as a means of amplifying and disseminating resistance genes. Metagenomic studies indicate that a wide variety of resistance genes are present in treatment plants and that these are assembled in a variety of clusters in transferable elements such as plasmids and phage. As a side project we are isolating bacteriophage that use Gram-negative pathogens as hosts in an attempt to develop phage-antibiotic combinations as novel therapeutic treatments for multi drug resistance pathogens. We are applying genetic and metagenomic approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics from various sources. In this case we are not screening for compounds with antibiotic activity but for novel biosynthetic pathways in microbial populations. Finally my laboratory is working on novel approached to antimicrobial therapy by studying the mode of action of "therapeutic" clays.My laboratory research is focused on antibiotic: their discovery, mode of action, mechanisms of resistance and their functions in the environment.

VUsing embryos of the frog Xenopus, De Robertis has studied the conserved molecular machinery that regulates cell differentiation. With his mentor, Nobel laureate Sir John Gurdon, he carried out studies in the molecular reprogramming of somatic nuclei transplanted into oocytes. At the University of Basel, during one of the most exciting periods of modern biology, he collaborated with his colleague Walter Gehring to isolate the first vertebrate development-controlling gene, now called HoxC6. The discovery that Hox genes were conserved between vertebrates and fruit flies marked the beginning of the new scientific discipline of evolution and development, Evo-Devo. At UCLA, De Robertis\u2019 laboratory dissected the molecular mechanisms that mediate embryonic induction of cell differentiation, a phenomenon first described by Nobel laureate Hans Spemann. Starting with a dorsal homeobox gene called goosecoid, he then isolated several secreted factors that pattern the embryo. A new paradigm was provided by Chordin, a protein secreted by dorsal cells that binds Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) growth factors, facilitating their transport through the space between ectoderm and mesoderm to the ventral side, where Chordin is digested by Tolloid protease liberating BMPs for signaling. Remarkably, the Chordin morphogenetic gradient determines dorsal to ventral tissue differentiations in most bilateral animals.Using embryos of the frog Xenopus, De Robertis has studied the conserved molecular machinery that regulates cell differentiation.

VThroughout his career, Angus Deaton\u2019s research has focused on understanding how people behave and on how to measure their wellbeing, understood to encompass material wellbeing, health, and happiness. His early work was concerned with consumer behavior, with how households allocate their spending across different goods and services, and how they respond to changes in prices and incomes. Such models are necessary for designing policies that make people better off, especially policies on taxation, planning, or antitrust. He has also tried to understand how people make decisions about saving, for example for retirement; saving is a key, not only for individual wellbeing, but also for macroeconomics. In his work on spending and on saving, a key focus has been aggregation, on how individual behavior adds up to the economy as a whole. In recent years, Deaton\u2019s analysis of wellbeing has expanded beyond material wellbeing, to health status, and to self-reports of happiness and life evaluation. He has worked on the measurement of poverty, both globally and nationally, and on the measurement of the multilateral international price indexes that are used to compare the cost of living between different countries. He has wrestled with national accounts statistics and household survey data in a sometimes-fruitless attempt at reconciliation, and to provide credible measures of growth, poverty, and inequality.Throughout his career, Angus Deaton\u2019s research has focused on understanding how people behave and on how to measure their wellbeing, understood to encompass material wellbeing, health, and happiness.

The models can be computationally \u201clesioned\u201d to mimic the error patterns of individual patients, thus allowing for the model to diagnose each individual\u2019s deficit. In addition, model parameters can be correlated with patient lesion locations with the result that model functions can be mapped onto brain regions.Gary Dell studies language production, the processes through which thoughts become spoken words.  Dell and colleagues have developed computational models of production that explain the nature and likelihood of speech errors.  These models are constrained by data from linguistics, neuroscience, and psychology.  Dell\u2019s experimental work tests predictions of the models by examining speech production under controlled conditions, and particularly the speech errors that arise in these conditions.  More recently, the models have been applied to language production deficits, such as aphasia resulting from damage to language areas of the brain.

VOver the last twenty years of independent research career at Yale University, Prof. Deng's research mainly centers on the molecular and biochemical mechanism for how light regulates plant development. Using Arabidopsis model, his group has identified a dozen of pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS loci responsible for mediating light control of plant development. They further demostrated that those COP/DET/FUS genes encoding proteins constitute three protein machineries involved in targeting photomorphogenesis-promoting factors for degradation by the 26S proteasome, in response to external stimuli. Two of those complexes defined two novel multiproetin complex E3 ligases (COP1 complexes and CDD complex) and the other is the well-conserved COP9 signalosome, a general eukaryotic Cullin-based E3 ligases regulator with de-rubbylation activity. Professor Deng lab are now applying both molecular/genetic and genomic approaches to further analyze the action mechanism of those novel cellular machineries, which are conserved among all multicellular organisms. Those discoveries made in plant model in Deng lab has significant implications in general biology research as well as those studies relationg to human health. Recently work from many groups including Deng lab have show the general conservation of those three complexes in all multicellular organism and their fundamental roles in a variety of developmenal and cellular processes. Over the last few years, Deng lab has initiated another area of research: genome-wide analysis of the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure/gene expression in rice and their role in rice heterosis.

One is the genetic, molecular and biochemical mechanism for light regulated seedling development in Arabidopsis, ongoing for the last 22 years under the NIH support. We have discovered a dozen pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS loci responsible for mediating light control of seedling development. Their encoded proteins constitute three protein machines involved in targeting photomorphogenesis-promoting factors for degradation by the 26S proteasome, in response to external stimuli. From time to time in the past, new aspects derived this NIH funded program were assisted by additional funds from NSF and other sources. Another research area is a relative new and an endeavor in last ten years, genome-wide analysis of the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure/gene expression in maize, rice and Arabidopsis, and using those genome wide platforms to understand genome basis of the plant heterosis. The genomic platforms developed here have critically helped my lab to taking advantages of the genome approaches in my NIH funded effort on light control of development.My laboratory research centers in two areas.

VRonald DeVore is a mathematician recognized for his work in applied mathematics, particularly those areas that interface numerical analysis, partial differential equations, data processing, machine learning and approximation of functions. DeVore was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Eastern Michigan University in 1964 and then obtained a doctoral degree in mathematics from Ohio State University in 1967 under the supervision of Ranko Bojanic. From 1968 to 1977, DeVore was at Oakland University and in 1977 he became a professor at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, where he served as the Robert L. Sumwalt Professor from 1986-2005. From 1999-2005 he served as the director of the Industrial Mathematics Institute, of which he co-founded.

VRaymond Deshaies\u2019s laboratory works on mechanisms of protein homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. They are particularly interested in the role of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Protein degradation via the UPS serves two general functions: it is employed to regulate pathways such as the cell cycle, and it is critical for quality control of the cellular proteome. Cells express ~600 or so ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes that promote ubiquitin conjugation to substrate proteins. Cullin\u2013RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) comprise a family of ~250 multisubunit E3s that function in many different regulatory pathways. The Deshaies group has studied how CRL enzymes assemble, how their activity is regulated by reversible modification with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8, how they promote catalysis, and what their substrates and cellular functions are. Another major focus is to understand how protein quality control works and how its malfunction or therapeutic manipulation relates to human diseases. This interest has motivated work on the mechanism, regulation, substrates, and inhibitors of the segregase p97/VCP, which plays a critical role in multiple cellular quality control pathways.Raymond Deshaies\u2019s laboratory works on mechanisms of protein homeostasis in eukaryotic cells.

VDouglas W. Diamond does theoretical research on financial intermediaries, financial crises, and liquidity His research agenda has been to explain what banks do, why they do it, and the consequences of these arrangements. Diamond\u2019s earliest research explained how the economic role of banks generated an essential link between the properties of their assets and the form of their liabilities; he showed how the bank\u2019s special assets (special because banks monitor special information about business borrowers) forced them to finance themselves with debt liabilities (deposits) rather than equity and also led banks to diversify across many loans. Research with Philip H. Dybvig demonstrated how banks specializing in creating liquid liabilities (deposits) to fund illiquid assets (such as business loans) may be unstable and give rise to bank runs and a need for deposit insurance. Diamond studied the role of short-term debt in corporate and bank capital structures. Research with Raghuram Rajan studied how banks can use the threat of bank runs to allow them to borrow more than the liquidation value of illiquid bank loans and examines the implications of this financial structure.Douglas W.

He has made a wide range of important contributions to our understanding of the structure and dynamics of proteins, and in a series of seminal studies he has transformed our knowledge of the mechanism of protein folding, a key step in the translation of genetic information into biological function, and of protein misfolding, a process that is now known to be the origin of some of the most debilitating medical disorders in the modern world, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and type II diabetes. Through the highly innovative exploitation of a wide variety of biophysical and biochemical techniques he has in particular developed a fundamentally new paradigm for understanding the nature of protein misfolding and its consequences, and hence of the underlying generic origins of the diseases with which it is associated. His research has provided a molecular explanation of the recent dramatic proliferation of these highly debilitating disorders and established the foundations for the novel and rational discovery of vitally important therapeutic strategies for their prevention and cure.Chris Dobson's research activities throughout his career have been focused at the interfaces of the physical, biological and medical sciences.

VWe investigate the generation of neuronal diversity and neural circuit formation in Drosophila andmouse. More specifically, our current focus is on characterizing genes that regulate temporal identity withinDrosophila neural stem cell lineages, identifying mechanisms of neural circuit formation for Drosophila larvallocomotion, and identifying and characterizing lamina-specific genes that are required for neural circuitformation and function in the mouse visual cortex.

Together with Gerard Laumon, he originated the so-called geometric Langlands program (with automorphic sheaves playing the role of automorphic functions). He also did some other work in algebraic geometry and algebra (classification of instantons, integrable systems, quantum groups, DG categories, chiral algebras, character sheaves on unipotent groups).

VWheat provides roughly 20% of the calories consumed by the human population and further increases in production and nutritional value are needed to sustain the growing human population. The major goal of Dr. Dubcovsky's research program are to gain a better understanding of the effects of allelic variants of wheat genes that are relevant to agriculture and to develop the tools required for an efficient manipulation of these genes in wheat improvement. The molecular markers, wheat genetic maps, wheat BAC libraries, transcriptome sequences and reverse genetic tools generated in Prof. Dubcovsky's laboratory have empowered wheat researchers world-wide to map useful traits and to deploy favorable alleles into commercial varieties.

VI am a veterinarian parasitologist interested in transmission of zoonotic parasitic diseases from animals to humans, and the discovery of new diseases that cause crippling diseases in humans and animals. I am most associated with the discovery of the transmission of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii to humans and animals through feces of cats and by eating undercooked infected meat. One-third of humanity is infected with T. gondii, and toxoplasmosis causes birth defects and loss of vision in humans and abortion in livestock. I cultivated and named the single celled parasite Neospora caninum, that causes abortion in cattle and crippling disease in companion animals. I also named the parasite Sarcocystis neurona that causes a fatal neurologic disease in horses in Americas. There are no effective vaccines or drugs to eliminate these parasites in tissues.  Control measures for these diseases and/or prevention of transmission to humans are based on farm management practices and hygienic measures based largely on the research that we have published.I am a veterinarian parasitologist interested in transmission of zoonotic parasitic diseases from animals to humans, and the discovery of new diseases that cause crippling diseases in humans and animals.

VCatherine Dulac is interested in the neural mechanisms underlying instinctive behaviors in mice. In earlier work she developed single cell cDNA cloning strategies to characterize novel families of pheromone receptors in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), thus providing new avenues of research into the logic of the pheromone-evoked responses in mammals. Her group identified key signaling molecules associated with pheromone detection, developed molecular strategies to uncover signals detected by individual VNO receptors, and investigated the functional organization of discrete pheromone-evoked behaviors circuits. Using new viral, genetic, and electrophysiological strategies to gain information about the brain processing of pheromone signals, her laboratory revealed the key role of VNO inputs in insuring the sex-specificity of pheromone evoked-behaviors, and demonstrated that functional neuronal circuits underlying male and female-specific behaviors co-exist in the brain of both sexes. Recently, her group uncovered a set of hypothalamic neurons expressing the peptide galanin that governs male and female paternal behavior in mice. In addition, her laboratory performed a genome-wide characterization of genomic imprinting in the adult and developing mouse brain, and uncovered large number of novel genes with parent-of-origin allelic expression differences, underscoring genomic imprinting as a major mode of epigenetic regulation in the brain.Catherine Dulac is interested in the neural mechanisms underlying instinctive behaviors in mice.

VI spent the first 25 years of my career at the University of Michigan working on and ultimately directing the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data collection project. Since 1968, the PSID has collected economic, demographic, health, behavior and attainment data from a representative sample of U.S. individuals and the households in which they reside. With these and other data I have studied the economic mobility of the U.S. population, both within and across generations, with a particular focus on low-income families. More specifically, I have investigated the roles families, peers, neighborhoods and public policy play in affecting the life chances of children and adolescents. My research has highlighted the importance of early childhood as a sensitive period for the damaging influences of economic deprivation as well as for the beneficial impacts of policy-induced income increases for working families. The focus of my more recent research has shifted from these environmental influences to the comparative importance of the skills and behaviors developed during childhood. In particular, I have sought to understand the relative importance of early academic skills, cognitive and emotional self-regulation, and health in promoting children's eventual success in school and the labor market.I spent the first 25 years of my career at the University of Michigan working on and ultimately directing the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data collection project.

VDwork studies privacy-preserving data analysis, from the theoretical limits on what is feasible to the development of differentially private algorithms, as well as the regulatory and policy frameworks for adoption of privacy-preserving technology. In addition, Dwork is currently engaged in two new directions of research: defining and ensuring fairness in classification, and the development of a general technique for ensuring the validity of statistical analyses under adaptivity, that is, when the questions asked depend on the data themselves. More broadly, her research agenda is to frame real-life societal problems in a rigorous way and lay down a mathematically rigorous theoretical groundwork for addressing them; to continue to invest effort in ongoing efforts such as privacy and fairness; and to inform the policy and regulatory debate on relevant issues from a position of strong technical understanding.Dwork studies privacy-preserving data analysis, from the theoretical limits on what is feasible to the development of differentially private algorithms, as well as the regulatory and policy frameworks for adoption of privacy-preserving technology.

VCynthia Dwork, a Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft Research, spearheaded a successful effort to place privacy-preserving analysis of data on a firm mathematical foundation. A cornerstone of this work is differential privacy, a strong privacy guarantee frequently permitting highly accurate data analysis. Previous positions include research staff member at IBM Almaden Research Center (1985 - 2000) where Dwork and her colleagues launched non-malleable cryptography, the subfield of modern cryptography that studies -- and remedies -- the failures of cryptographic protocols to compose securely. She is a co-inventor of proofs of computational effort, a concept at the heart of a popular crypto-currency, and co-inventor of the first public-key cryptosystem whose security depends on the worst-case, rather than average-case, hardness of the underlying problem. Dwork is a recipient of the Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize, recognizing some of her earliest work for establishing the pillars on which every fault tolerant system has been built for more than two decades. She is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, and the US National Academy of Engineering, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is a founding editor of the Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality. Dr. Dwork received her B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University and her Ph.D. in computer science from Cornell University.Cynthia Dwork, a Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft Research, spearheaded a successful effort to place privacy-preserving analysis of data on a firm mathematical foundation.

VKathryn Edin studies poverty by deploying ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and mixed method approaches to the domains of welfare and low-wage work, family life, and neighborhood contexts. She has taken on key mysteries about the urban poor that weren\u2019t been fully answered by quantitative work, including: How do single mothers possibly survive on welfare? Why don\u2019t more go to work? Why do they end up as single mothers in the first place? Where are the fathers and why do they disengage from their children\u2019s lives? How have the lives of the single mothers changed as a result of welfare reform? Her work has convinced many in the poverty-research community that deep insight into the lives of the poor requires both surveys and systematic qualitative explorations. A primary contribution of her research, beyond its substantive and theoretical merit, is thus the linkage between surveys and qualitative components. Now considered mainstream, this method has been incorporated into many of the most important national poverty studies. She has authored five books with a sixth forthcoming and some 50 journal articles.Kathryn Edin studies poverty by deploying ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and mixed method approaches to the domains of welfare and low-wage work, family life, and neighborhood contexts.

VThe Edwards lab wishes to understand how the basic properties of neurotransmitter release influence synaptic transmission and plasticity, behavior and neuropsychiatric disease. Using selection in a toxin that causes parkinsonism, they identified the first transporter that packages a classical transmitter into synaptic vesicles, implicating this activity in neural degeneration. The vesicular monoamine transporter defined a family of proteins that includes the vesicular acetylcholine transporter and the Edwards lab subsequently identified two other unrelated families that transport GABA and glutamate into synaptic vesicles. They also developed methods to elucidate the function, mechanism and regulation of these intracellular transporters. Using electrophysiology, they have shown that the vesicular glutamate transporters undergo an unusual form of allosteric regulation by Cl- and H+, and also exhibit an uncoupled Cl- conductance. Current work focuses on the role of these properties in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Since the vesicular transporters define the cells and vesicles capable of transmitter release, the group has also used them to establish the phenomenon of neurotransmitter corelease, in which a single neuron releases two classical transmitters. In addition, they have used targeting of the vesicular monoamine transporter to dense core vesicles to elucidate formation of the regulated secretory pathway that mediates release of peptide hormones and neural peptides. The work has diverse implications for behavior and disease, and Robert Edwards focuses on the pathogenesis of Parkinson\u2019s disease, in particular the function of the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein that has a central role in this disorder.The Edwards lab wishes to understand how the basic properties of neurotransmitter release influence synaptic transmission and plasticity, behavior and neuropsychiatric disease.

VScott Edwards\u2019 research focuses on diverse aspects of the evolutionary biology of birds, including evolutionary history and biogeography, disease ecology, population genetics and comparative genomics.  To study avian phylogeography he conducted extensive fieldwork in Australia and produced some of the first continent-wide phylogeographic analyses based on DNA sequencing.  He did a postdoctoral fellowship in immunogenetics at the University of Florida to study the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of birds, an important multigene family encoding receptors that mediate pathogen recognition and surveillance, as well as mate choice.  He helped develop the House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) as an emerging model system for studying the evolutionary consequences of pathogens on animal hosts, focusing on genome-wide effects on sequence change and gene expression of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum.  His work on the MHC led him to study the large-scale structure and dinosaurian origins of the avian genome.  In the last 10 years Dr. Edwards has helped develop novel methods for estimating phylogenetic trees from multilocus DNA sequence data using coalescent theory.  His recent work uses comparative genomics in diverse contexts to study macroevolutionary patterns in birds, including the origin of feathers and the evolution of flightlessness.Scott Edwards\u2019 research focuses on diverse aspects of the evolutionary biology of birds, including evolutionary history and biogeography, disease ecology, population genetics and comparative genomics.  To study avian phylogeography he conducted extensive fieldwork in Australia and produced some of the first continent-wide phylogeographic analyses based on DNA sequencing.  He did a postdoctoral fellowship in immunogenetics at the University of Florida to study the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of birds, an important multigene family encoding receptors that mediate pathogen recognition and surveillance, as well as mate choice.  He helped develop the House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) as an emerging model system for studying the evolutionary consequences of pathogens on animal hosts, focusing on genome-wide effects on sequence change and gene expression of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum.  His work on the MHC led him to study the large-scale structure and dinosaurian origins of the avian genome.  In the last 10 years Dr. Edwards has helped develop novel methods for estimating phylogenetic trees from multilocus DNA sequence data using coalescent theory.  His recent work uses comparative genomics in diverse contexts to study macroevolutionary patterns in birds, including the origin of feathers and the evolution of flightlessness.Scott Edwards\u2019 research focuses on diverse aspects of the evolutionary biology of birds, including evolutionary history and biogeography, disease ecology, population genetics and comparative genomics.  To study avian phylogeography he conducted extensive fieldwork in Australia and produced some of the first continent-wide phylogeographic analyses based on DNA sequencing.  He did a postdoctoral fellowship in immunogenetics at the University of Florida to study the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of birds, an important multigene family encoding receptors that mediate pathogen recognition and surveillance, as well as mate choice.  He helped develop the House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) as an emerging model system for studying the evolutionary consequences of pathogens on animal hosts, focusing on genome-wide effects on sequence change and gene expression of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum.  His work on the MHC led him to study the large-scale structure and dinosaurian origins of the avian genome.  In the last 10 years Dr. Edwards has helped develop novel methods for estimating phylogenetic trees from multilocus DNA sequence data using coalescent theory.  His recent work uses comparative genomics in diverse contexts to study macroevolutionary patterns in birds, including the origin of feathers and the evolution of flightlessness.

VJohn Eiler\u2019s research group focuses primarily on developing technologies for determining the isotopic structures of natural molecules (i.e., the proportions of molecular forms having different numbers and/or sites of rare-isotope substitutions), and applying those technologies to understand the chemical physics of isotopes and to solve applied problems in Earth history, environmental science, and planetary science. Advances stemming from this research include a new class of geothermometers based on measuring the proportions of doubly-substituted isotopic forms of molecules and mineral formula units, particularly for carbonate minerals and methane. These tools have provided new insights into the body temperatures of dinosaurs, Earth\u2019s climate in the distant geological past, the rates of elevation change in mountain belts, thermal histories of rocks from Mars and primitive asteroids, and the origins of thermogenic and biogenic natural gas. Ongoing developments focus on the technologies for and applied uses of measurements of diverse isotopologues of organic molecules, with applications in the natural and applied sciences.John Eiler\u2019s research group focuses primarily on developing technologies for determining the isotopic structures of natural molecules (i.e., the proportions of molecular forms having different numbers and/or sites of rare-isotope substitutions), and applying those technologies to understand the chemical physics of isotopes and to solve applied problems in Earth history, environmental science, and planetary science.

VDaniel Eisenstein works on a wide range of topics in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy, with particular interests in the large-scale structure of the Universe, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, and opportunities of large statistical data sets in astronomy. His largest effort has been in the use of the relic imprint of the baryon acoustic oscillations of the early Universe to provide a robust method for the measurement of the cosmic distance scale and the study of dark energy. He has conducted extensive theoretical and numerical investigations of the method and led the observational pursuit of this weak but important signature in the clustering of galaxies. The acoustic oscillations are now a central feature of several ambitious new galaxy surveys, with the goal of measuring cosmic distances to approaching 0.1% accuracy. Eisenstein has been active in the design, observation, and analysis of several large extragalactic surveys that provide detailed three-dimensional maps of the Universe. Through modern cosmological theory and simulations, the statistical clustering in these maps provides a powerful window to the study of the composition of the Universe and the evolution of galaxies.Daniel Eisenstein works on a wide range of topics in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy, with particular interests in the large-scale structure of the Universe, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, and opportunities of large statistical data sets in astronomy.

VI am a developmental/reproductive biologist studying the development of mammalian oocytes, the cells that become eggs. The focus of my research is on the complex interactions between developing oocytes and their companion follicular somatic cells, the granulosa cells. I found that oocytes are not simply passive recipients of nutrients and signals from ovarian follicular somatic cells, as once believed, but rather actively promote the functions of somatic cells needed to support oocyte development and regulate meiosis. I originated the concept of an oocyte-granulosa cell regulatory loop in which bi-directional communication between the oocyte and companion granulosa cells is essential for both normal oocyte and follicular development. A major goal of my current research is to define the components of this regulatory loop and their functions. I also achieved the first complete development of mammalian oocytes in vitro. This included in vitro initiation of primordial follicle development, oocyte growth, and acquisition of competence to undergo maturation, fertilization, and, after transfer of preimplantation embryos to foster mothers, the birth of live young. Finally, I am the Principal Investigator of a Program Project to develop mouse mutant models of infertility using ENU mutagenesis.I am a developmental/reproductive biologist studying the development of mammalian oocytes, the cells that become eggs.

VJames Estes\u2019 laboratory is interested in the behavioral ecology of large predators and the impacts of these animals on other species and ecological processes. They have explored the effects of sea otter predation on temperate reef ecosystems by first defining the food web\u2019s structure through observational studies and then documenting the dynamic consequences of various consumer-prey interactions by contrasting islands of the Aleutian archipelago as sea otter populations waxed and waned following their near-extinction by the Pacific maritime fur trade. They have shown that sea otters enhance kelp forests by limiting populations of herbivorous sea urchins; that the effects of this trophic cascade extend widely through coastal ecosystems to other species and ecological processes; that predation by sea otters and their recent ancestors decoupled the coevolution of defense and resistance by marine plants and their herbivores; and that North Pacific kelp forests have been further influenced by events in the open sea that caused killer whales to begin preying on sea otters, thus driving otter populations downward and altering their effects on coastal ecosystems through the otter-urchin-kelp trophic cascade. Using this system as a model, they have helped identify the ecological and evolutionary influences of large predators across global ecosystems and the resulting consequences of widespread losses of these species on numerous features of the world we live in.James Estes\u2019 laboratory is interested in the behavioral ecology of large predators and the impacts of these animals on other species and ecological processes.

Using this system as a model, they have helped identify the ecological and evolutionary influences of large predators across global ecosystems and the resulting consequences of widespread losses of these species on numerous features of the world we live in.James Estes\u2019 laboratory is interested in the behavioral ecology of large predators and the impacts of these animals on other species and ecological processes.

VJames Estes is Distinguished Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Estes is a wildlife ecologist, recognized for his work on the ecosystem-level influences of large predators. He is known especially for studies of sea otters and kelp forest ecosystems, from which he demonstrated the enhancing influence of predators on the distribution and abundance of plants through what has since come to be widely known as a \u201ctrophic cascade. Estes was born in Sacramento, California, in 1945. He graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in zoology in 1967, subsequently obtaining a Masters in Biology from Washington State University in 1969 and a Ph.D. in biology and statistics from the University of Arizona in 1974. He was employed as a research scientist by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey from 1974 to 2007, after which he joined the faculty at the University of California at Santa Cruz. In recognition of his work\u2019s scientific and societal impacts, Estes received the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Schumaker Award for excellence in science communication, the Western Society of Naturalists\u2019 Lifetime Achievement Award, and the American Society of Mammalogists\u2019 C.

VSteven Evans has interests that cover a broad cross-section of the mathematical theory of probability and its applications. On the theoretical side, he has contributed to the study of sample path properties of Levy processes and Brownian motion, probability on algebraic structures such polynomials, groups and fields, probability on combinatorial structures such as trees, measure-valued Markov processes, random measures, point processes, coalescing particle systems, spectra and elementary divisors of random matrices, and Doob--Martin compactification theory. Evans' work in applications -- much of it collaborative -- has ranged across phylogenetics (particularly phylogenetic invariants and phylogeny in historical linguistics), biodemography (elucidating the evolutionary basis of aging and senescence using mutation-selection-recombination models), population genetics (inference of natural selection from ancient DNA), metagenomics (methods for displaying the diversity between and within metagenomic samples), mathematical finance (models for default), population dynamics (understanding protected polymorphisms and the evolutionary stability of patch-selection strategies in the presence of spatio-temporal heterogeneity), and astronomy (they dynamics of propellers in the rings of Saturn).Steven Evans has interests that cover a broad cross-section of the mathematical theory of probability and its applications.

VAndy Fabian is interested in accreting black holes; in particular how, and what, radiation is produced and how, in the case of massive black holes, this can affect the host galaxy. A useful process which he has explored for several decades is X-ray reflection, in which hard X-rays generated in a corona irradiate the accretion flow and are then observed as backscattered and fluorescent emission. Emission lines in the reflection spectrum are distorted by doppler and gravitational shifts which reveal the velocity and location of the reflecting material. Short time delays (reverberation) between variations in the hard emission and the reflection spectrum, discovered in AGN a few years ago by his team, give location in physical units and indicate geometry. X-ray reflection enables the accretion flow in the innermost radii around luminous sources to be mapped and black hole spin measured. Radiation and outflows from an accreting black holes interact with surrounding gas, pushing or heating it so that it promotes or stops star formation in the host. His Chandra X-ray images of clusters such as that in Perseus show the process in detail. To obtain a fuller picture, Fabian and his team use many wavebands are (including radio, submillimetre, infrared and optical as well as X-ray).Andy Fabian is interested in accreting black holes; in particular how, and what, radiation is produced and how, in the case of massive black holes, this can affect the host galaxy.

VFarley is a technique-oriented geochemist focusing on the use of the noble gases, mainly helium isotopes, as tracers and chronometers of terrestrial and extraterrestrial processes. Much of the development and calibration of the (U-Th)/He dating system now commonly used to establish the cooling and exhumation history of rocks was developed in Farley's lab. A second long-term effort has shown that the accretion rate of cosmic dust to Earth can be traced by the 3He concentration of marine sediments, and that variations in the flux document major events in the history of the solar system such as comet showers and collisions between asteroids. Additional areas of interest include surface exposure dating and characterization of the geochemical evolution of the Earth as recorded in the isotopic composition of volcanic rocks. On the Mars Science Laboratory mission Farley led an effort to obtain the first radiometric and surface exposure age measurements performed on another planet. He is now project scientist for a NASA Mars mission, planned for launch in 2020, that will prepare samples for possible future return to Earth for intensive study.Farley is a technique-oriented geochemist focusing on the use of the noble gases, mainly helium isotopes, as tracers and chronometers of terrestrial and extraterrestrial processes.

His linking of variation in carbon isotope composition and transpiration efficiency has provided a new tool for breeders and led to the development of wheat varieties for dry areas. His equations are also widely applied in earth systems science. His recent interests extend to large-scale issues of global change, including evaporative demand, precipitation and run-off, and effects on plants of increasing levels of carbon dioxide.

His recent interests extend to large-scale issues of global change, including evaporative demand, precipitation and run-off, and effects on plants of increasing levels of carbon dioxide. Farquhar is also interested in how crop yields can be increased.

VHaving trained in Medicine and Immunology, my major interests have been to explore the mechanisms of human autoimmune diseases. My hypothesis that upregulated antigen presentation and elevated cytokine expression were important in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, led to a productive collaboration with Professor Sir Ravinder Maini which has elucidated the importance of TNFa in rheumatoid arthritis. This was established using cultures of human diseased synovium, in animal models and in clinical trials, and has led to TNF blockade therapy being standard care for several rheumatoid arthritis.Having trained in Medicine and Immunology, my major interests have been to explore the mechanisms of human autoimmune diseases.

VJulio A. Fernández's research has fundamentally been related to accretion and scattering of planetesimals by the Jovian planets, dynamical evolution of comets and formation of the Oort cloud. Comets are considered to be the most primitive bodies of the solar system, the icy planetesimals that were left after the formation of the planets, so their study is of key importance to understand the accretion processes in the protoplanetary disk. As a sample of the most relevant results of his work it can be mentioned: (1) Jupiter family comets (i.e. comets in short-period orbits whose evolution is dominated by Jupiter's perturbations) may come from a -at that time (1980)- putative trans-neptunian belt, result that was conrmed several years later with the discovery of the trans-neptunian objects. (2) Most Oort cloud comets may come from the Uranus-Neptune zone, from where they were scattered to near-parabolic orbits by the Jovian planets after their formation. (3) The original birthplaces of the Jovian planets were shown to be dierent from their current locations due to a substantial migration during their accretion process by the exchange of angular momentum between the accreting Jovian planets and the gravitationally scattered planetesimals located in the protoplanetary disk. This phenomenon has attracted a lot of attention in the last couple of decades after the discovery of exoplanets very close to their central stars that probably migrated from larger distances. (5) The theory that the solar system formed within an open cluster, as most stars do, so the structure of the Oort comet cloud surrounding the solar system was shaped by the gravitational perturbations of other member stars of the primordial cluster.Julio A.

VField describes his research as spectroscopy beyond molecular constants.  He views producing archival tables of molecular constants as a necessary evil on the path toward insights into fundamental intramolecular interaction mechanisms, detecting the emergence of "isomerization-eigenstates" that embody large amplitude vibrational motions, and gaining spectroscopic access to barrier-proximal eigenstates that provide maps of chemically interesting regions of a potential energy surface. The existence of such eigenstates will facilitate rationally designed external control schemes for non-ergodic dynamics.  It might seem impossible that a light electron could exchange energy with heavy nuclei, yet the study of molecular Rydberg states can reveal the strengths and quantum number scaling rules for each of the important electron to ion-core energy exchange mechanisms.  Revolutionary techniques, such as chirped pulse microwave spectroscopy and buffer-gas-cooled ablation sources enable spectroscopists to answer questions about localized intramolecular interactions, the coexistence of large amplitude motion eigenstates with predominantly ergodic eigenstates, and creation of all-spectra, all-dynamics causal models based on Multichannel Quantum Defect Theory.  Field's co-authored book, The Spectra and Dynamics of Diatomic Molecules, provides a unified treatment of the concepts and techniques of frequency- and time-domain spectra suggests how these may be extended beyond diatomic molecules.Field describes his research as spectroscopy beyond molecular constants.  He views producing archival tables of molecular constants as a necessary evil on the path toward insights into fundamental intramolecular interaction mechanisms, detecting the emergence of "isomerization-eigenstates" that embody large amplitude vibrational motions, and gaining spectroscopic access to barrier-proximal eigenstates that provide maps of chemically interesting regions of a potential energy surface.

VMary Firestone\u2019s laboratory investigates the ecological interactions of microorganisms with their soil environment. The extreme heterogeneity of soil and the scale at which microorganisms interact with their habitat has made understanding the ecology of soil microbes a life-long challenge. Members of the Firestone lab have extensively studied the roles of microbial community structure and function in controlling terrestrial ecosystem processes, working toward understanding the biogeochemistry of carbon and nitrogen cycling by interfacing the microbial bases of nutrient transformation with the functioning of ecosystems. To provide structure and clarity to data sets delineating the most diverse and complex assemblages of organisms on earth, the Firestone lab has used concepts and methods from macro-organismal community ecology. The research done in the Firestone lab seeks fundamental understanding as well as knowledge relevant to current applied problems such as the use of soil microbiomes to enhance plant tolerance to environmental stresses. Firestone\u2019s research program has brought to bear expertise in microbiology, biogeochemistry, ecosystems, and community ecology to globally-important questions including climate change, sustainability, land use change, and environmental contamination.Mary Firestone\u2019s laboratory investigates the ecological interactions of microorganisms with their soil environment.

VAfter three decades in condensed matter physics, Daniel Fisher\u2019s research focus since 2005 has been on biological questions. This has included cellular biophysics, systems neuroscience, and, particularly, evolutionary dynamics.  He has played a leading role in developing, in collaborations with several experimental groups, laboratory evolution of microbes into a quantitative field with close coupling between theory and experiment. The power of  DNA sequencing of whole populations has enabled tracking the origins and dynamics of mutations in the laboratory, as well as the study of within-species diversity in natural microbial populations. Fisher has developed theoretical frameworks and methods of analysis to infer aspects of the evolutionary history of such populations and distinguish between scenarios. Developing understanding of simple models of evolutionary dynamics, including the benefits of recombination, the statistics of diversity generated by continual selection, and the co-evolution of populations and ecology, has been a main goal of his theoretical work. Fisher has also been involved in high-throughput analyses of antibody repertoires of zebrafish and human immune systems and how these respond to antigens.After three decades in condensed matter physics, Daniel Fisher\u2019s research focus since 2005 has been on biological questions.

VFiske investigates social cognition, especially cognitive stereotypes and emotional prejudices, at cultural, interpersonal, and neuro-scientific levels. She is most known for theories and research on how people think about each other: the continuum model of impression formation, the power-as-control theory, the ambivalent sexism theory, prescriptive ageism, and the stereotype content model (SCM). Current SCM work focuses on the two fundamental dimensions of social cognition: other people's apparent warmth/trustworthiness and competence. People use social structure to infer these dimensions (cooperation-competition predicts warmth; status predicts competence). Distinct emotions (pride, disgust, envy, pity) reflect each warmth-x-competence quadrant. Specific behaviors (active and passive help or harm) follow. Her lab currently focuses on SCM's varieties of prejudices: dehumanizing allegedly disgusting homeless people, Schadenfreude toward the enviable rich, as well as paternalistic pity and prescriptive prejudices toward older people, disabled people, and women in traditional roles. Applying the SCM is her just-published The HUMAN Brand: How We Relate to People, Products, and Companies (with Chris Malone, 2013). Focused on social comparison is Envy Up, Scorn Down: How Status Divides Us (2011). With Shelley Taylor, she wrote a classic text: Social Cognition (2013, 4/e) and solo, Social Beings: Core Motives in Social Psychology (2013, 3/e). She edited the Handbook of Social Psychology (2010, 5/e), Social Neuroscience (2011), the Sage Handbook of Social Cognition (2012), Beyond Common Sense: Psychological Science in the Courtroom (2008), and Facing Social Class: How Societal Rank Influences Interaction (2012).Fiske investigates social cognition, especially cognitive stereotypes and emotional prejudices, at cultural, interpersonal, and neuro-scientific levels.

VThe methods of structural biology have triggered my investigations into learning the functional mechanisms of enzymes, scaffolding proteins and molecular motors. We have learned the atomic level controls that glycogen phosphorylases need to fragment glycogen in different tissues and how the regulatory mechanisms evolved from yeast to mammals.  The precise roles of constellations of amino acids in forming specific interactions with substrates and for speeding peptide hydrolysis was revealed for proteases through protein engineering and biochemistry. Analysis of the structures of five kinesins in varied conformations and with a protein regulator showed how ATP hydrolysis and mechanical motion by a motor protein are intertwined to power motility in cells.  Some of the mysteries of clathrin, an assembly vehicle for some membrane vesicles, were revealed by high resolution X-ray analysis and biochemistry. Nuclear receptors form the core of many transcription machines. Our studies showed how hormone binding triggers the assembly of the machine and taught us the importance of specific matching of hormone to receptor. The subjects or our studies have varied widely, but the questions have been fundamental and the answers satisfying and sometimes surprising. We uncovered many beautiful designs in biology that verify structure is function and function is structure.The methods of structural biology have triggered my investigations into learning the functional mechanisms of enzymes, scaffolding proteins and molecular motors.

VProfessor Fortov belongs to the scientists whose works determine the modern state of physical and engineering science in such fields as energetics, space research, high energy density physics, extreme states of matter, thermal properties of materials, low-temperature plasmas, interaction of intense energy fluxes with matter, combustion and explosion. Vladimir Fortov was one of the firsts to apply the strong shock waves for generation of intense pulses of electric current and investigation of physical and chemical properties of materials under extremely high pressures and temperatures. He was the first to carry out the detailed measurements of properties of perspective working media for magneto hydrodynamic and magnetic flux compression electric generators - dense plasmas with the strong Coulomb interparticle interaction. Under his supervision the means of spacecraft protection against the impact of dust particles were elaborated in the framework of the international project "Vega". Professor Fortov is the head of many technical projects in the field of energetics, space and nuclear science. He is the chief designer of high-power compact pulse MHD generator of multymegawatt power range for industrial and space applications. Under supervision of Professor Vladimir Fortov the complex of basic studies of the formation of quasi-crystalline ordered structures in dusty plasmas of different origin was conducted. On the board of the orbital space station "Mir" the unique experimental investigations of dusty crystals have been made. The continuation of the space experiment "Coulomb crystal" has been performed on board the International Space Station. Professor Fortov was one of the firsts to develop theoretical basics of the construction of the wide-range equations of state (EOS) for materials under extreme conditions. He is responsible for much of the practical applications of detonation and combustion, development of hydrodynamic instabilities, processes of high-velocity impact in technical systems.Professor Fortov belongs to the scientists whose works determine the modern state of physical and engineering science in such fields as energetics, space research, high energy density physics, extreme states of matter, thermal properties of materials, low-temperature plasmas, interaction of intense energy fluxes with matter, combustion and explosion.

His current interests include the origins and failures of civilizations and the light that maritime states like the Calusa of SW Florida can throw on the issue.  He is also involved in a study of the relationship between human mediogamy (his term) and the biology of population growth and decline, fertility, and dispersion.

VFrancisco has applied new tools from theoretical chemistry to atmospheric chemical problems to enhance our understanding of chemistry in the atmosphere at the molecular level. Examples include the atmospheric chemistry of chlorofluorocarbon, which systematically described in detail the underlying photo-oxidation pathways of the trihalomethyl radical, serving as basis for understanding the atmospheric chemistry of halocarbons. Recently Francisco has focused on the study of radical-molecule complexes, discovering a new class of association species held together by strong hydrogen bonding. This work has led to significant new understanding of the effect of water on reactivity and product distributions of fundamental reactions. He is also interested in chemistry at the interface of cloud/aerosol surfaces. Work in this area focuses on understanding how the interface orients molecules and alters their chemistry from that in the gas phase.Francisco has applied new tools from theoretical chemistry to atmospheric chemical problems to enhance our understanding of chemistry in the atmosphere at the molecular level.

VOne of the main focuses of Marcella Frangipane research activity has been the study of the characteristics and paths of the emergence of the first centralised societies, and the origin and nature of power, in a primary context, such as the northern regions of "Greater Mesopotamia". Frangipane has leaded, in this area, two field projects in two tells along the Upper and Middle Euphrates valley: Arslantepe and Zeytinli Bahçe. Her approach was to base the investigation of primary phenomena on looking for primary data from the actual archaeological contexts to be analysed, trying to investigate specific historical trajectories through pure archaeological research and building on them new explanatory models and theories. Frangipane and her team have in this perspective dedicated many efforts to develop a rigorous strategy of field research, redefining excavation and documentation methods to precisely contextualize information and, by thoroughly analysing it in an interdisciplinary and combinatory way, arrive to propose original explanation models for the social and historical phenomena under study. The excavations at Arslantepe constitute the clearest example of the application of this approach. One of the most outstanding results was the detailed reconstruction of a very early and sophisticated administrative system before writing. Frangipane has recently extended her interest in the rise of hierarchies and inequality to the very origins of the phenomena in the 6th and 5th millennia BC.One of the main focuses of Marcella Frangipane research activity has been the study of the characteristics and paths of the emergence of the first centralised societies, and the origin and nature of power, in a primary context, such as the northern regions of "Greater Mesopotamia".

VJanet Franklin studies the patterns and dynamics of terrestrial plant communities at the landscape scale. Plant communities are important elements of regional biodiversity and provide essential habitat for individual species. She has done field work in California, the American Southwest, West Africa, South Africa, the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean. As a geographer her work often focuses on describing spatial patterns and inferring underlying pattern-generating processes via simulation modeling, natural and designed experiments, and other approaches. She is recognized for her expertise in species distribution modeling, a methodology that associates observations of a biotic response variable such as species occurrence with environmental predictors, resulting in a spatial prediction of habitat suitability. Her research addresses the impacts of natural disturbance and human-caused landscape change on ecosystems and biodiversity, and has provided insights about synergistic impacts of global change factors on biodiversity. Land use change, altered disturbance regimes, climate change, and invasive species operate at the scale of landscapes and regions, leading to ecosystem change, habitat loss and species decline. Only by considering these factors together can it be determined which factors may amplify effects of others (for example urban growth and climate change), and where.Janet Franklin studies the patterns and dynamics of terrestrial plant communities at the landscape scale.

He is currently involved in a large high resolution spectroscopic survey (GALAH, on the Anglo Australian Telescope) to measure abundances of about 30 chemical elements in a million stars in the Milky Way.

VAs a statistician my research has predominantly centered on the statistical machine learning problem. The goal is to use data derived from some system under study to try to learn or understand its nature, and/or to predict aspects of its behavior in the future. My focus has been on the development of general purpose learning machines, implemented in software, that can be used in a wide variety of settings with different types of data. Primarily based on the data itself, with minimal user input or guidance, these programs attempt to automatically extract relevant patterns in the data characterizing intrinsic properties of the system that can then be used to make reliable inferences and predictions concerning its properties. Over the years I have developed or been involved in developing a variety of machine learning techniques that have been successfully applied to data from a wide variety of scientific disciplines, as well as medical, commercial, and industrial applications. These include classification and regression trees (CART), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), multiple additive regression trees (MART) and rule based predictive ensembles (RuleFit).As a statistician my research has predominantly centered on the statistical machine learning problem.

VMy research is focused on developing improved computational methods for quantum chemistry, biomolecular simulation, and structure based drug design. In the area of quantum chemistry, we are pursuing improvements in density functional theory, as well as highly correlated wavefunction based approaches. We are applying these methods to modeling of the electronic properties of interesting electronic materials such as titanium dioxide, and to a wide range of transition metal complexes. Our work in biomolecular simulation utilizes both continuum solvent based models and all atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics. We have two principal long term objectives in this work. The first is to be able to computationally refine protein structures, and the structures of protein-ligand complexes, to high resolution. Low resolution structures can often be generated by homology modeling or approximate docking methods; achieving high resolution is much more difficult. Increasing computing capacity, combined with advances in computational models and sampling algorithms, are enabling this problem to be profitably tackled. The second objective is the development of a hierarchy of approaches for predicting protein-ligand binding affinities, using methods ranging from empirical scoring functions to free energy perturbation theory. Both of these capabilities are crucial in enabling computational methods to be effectively used in structure based drug discovery projects.My research is focused on developing improved computational methods for quantum chemistry, biomolecular simulation, and structure based drug design.

In the field of cross-coupling chemistry to form carbon\u2013carbon bonds, the laboratory has developed methods that enable the use of important families of readily available reaction partners, such as aryl chlorides and alkyl halides, that had previously been believed to generally be unsuitable for such processes; these efforts have helped to open the door to another dimension of cross-coupling, the enantioconvergent synthesis of organic molecules from racemic mixtures of reaction partners.

Another interest is the robustness of repeated game models to various sorts of perturbations, both according to theoretical analysis and in experiments.

VMy research concerns the topology and geometry of two and three-dimensional manifolds. An n-dimensional manifold is an object that locally looks like the standard Euclidean n-space. For example the sphere and the torus (the surface of the donut) are examples of 2-dimensional manifolds. When a manifold has extra structure, such as a taut foliation or a hyperbolic metric (i.e. a metric of constant negative curvature) a beautiful interplay between the geometry and topology often ensues. A 3-manifold has a taut foliation if it can be decomposed into a coherent union of infinitely thin sheets (somewhat like an onion) such that all the sheets can in an appropriate sense be pulled tight. I proved that many 3-dimensional manifolds have taut foliations and used that to prove the Property R conjecture in knot theory. I.e. there is an essentially unique way to go from the 3-sphere to the product of the sphere and the circle by drilling out one solid tube from each. Others have used my work on taut foliations to establish fundamental properties in the theory of contact structures, Heegaard Floer homology and instanton homology. I proved the Smale conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds which says that the space of diffeomorphisms is homotopy equivalent to the space of isometries. Danny Calegari and I (and independently Ian Agol) proved Marden's tameness conjecture which asserts that for hyperbolic 3-ï¿½manifolds, the part of the manifold near "infinity" is topologically as standard as possible. Tameness completed the proof of the Ahlfors measure conjecture and is crucial for the resolution of many other important conjectures in hyperbolic geometry. Rob Meyerhoff, Peter Milley and I found the smallest hyperbolic 3-manifold. Roughly speaking we found the most efficient way of symmetrically packing hyperbolic 3-space by balls.My research concerns the topology and geometry of two and three-dimensional manifolds.

I.e. there is an essentially unique way to go from the 3-sphere to the product of the sphere and the circle by drilling out one solid tube from each. Others have used my work on taut foliations to establish fundamental properties in the theory of contact structures, Heegaard Floer homology and instanton homology. I proved the Smale conjecture for hyperbolic 3-manifolds which says that the space of diffeomorphisms is homotopy equivalent to the space of isometries. Danny Calegari and I (and independently Ian Agol) proved Marden's tameness conjecture which asserts that for hyperbolic 3-ï¿½manifolds, the part of the manifold near "infinity" is topologically as standard as possible. Tameness completed the proof of the Ahlfors measure conjecture and is crucial for the resolution of many other important conjectures in hyperbolic geometry. Rob Meyerhoff, Peter Milley and I found the smallest hyperbolic 3-manifold. Roughly speaking we found the most efficient way of symmetrically packing hyperbolic 3-space by balls.

VThe overarching theme of Garcia's laboratory is to understand the structural and functional aspects of cell surface receptor recognition and activation, primarily in the immune system, where cell-cell communication is key part of how immune responses are orchestrated. Other systems of study in the Garcia lab include, Wnt/Frizzled, Notch/Jagged, and chemokine GPCRs. In particular he seeks to understand how the structure of surface receptors influences intracellular signaling, and whether these structural principles can used to be engineer proteins that elicit new downstream signals and cellular functions. A particular focus here is on "shared" pleiotropic receptors in the immune system, such as alpha Beta TCRs, and cytokine receptors. In the case of the former, he and his colleagues determined the basic structural framework for how T cell receptors recognize peptide-MHCs, a phenomenon known as MHC restriction. The Garcia group has also gained molecular insight into how homeostasis of immune cells is controlled by immunoregulatory cytokines, such as Interleukins and Interferons, through activation of shared receptors including gp130 and common gamma chain. Collectively, Garcia has defined several structural mechanisms by which functional specificity can be elicited by different ligands that act through common receptors. Looking forward, Garcia's group is translating their wealth of structural and mechanistic information on immune receptor signaling into the development of protein-based therapeutics for a range of immunological diseases and therapies.The overarching theme of Garcia's laboratory is to understand the structural and functional aspects of cell surface receptor recognition and activation, primarily in the immune system, where cell-cell communication is key part of how immune responses are orchestrated.

VMajor efforts in Sam Gellman's program stem from a fascination with the structure and function of proteins. His group has helped to establish design rules for creation of small, autonomously folding beta-sheets; these systems were then used to address fundamental questions such as whether stability is influenced by beta-sheet size. Another research trajectory has focused on developing fully synthetic analogues of proteins based on the use of beta- or gamma-amino acids as building blocks, rather than or in addition to the natural alpha-amino acids. Gellman's group has helped to elucidate the folding "rules" for these protein-mimetic systems and to develop applications for these new types of molecules. A third program has explored whether the functions of natural polypeptides always depend upon a specific subunit sequence. This work has shown that the activity profiles of some evolved polypeptides, such as antimicrobial host-defense peptides, can be mimicked by sequence-random copolymers.Major efforts in Sam Gellman's program stem from a fascination with the structure and function of proteins.

VLearning in biological systems, measured by performance as a function of the number of training samples, is strikingly efficient when compared to artificial systems. These observations apply equally to individuals (children learn to recognize tens-of-thousands of categories in their first eight years) and to species (evolution outpaces our best models of selection and fitness). A prototype problem is computer vision. Humans outperform computers despite computer-vision training sets with far more examples than any human being will see in a lifetime. My hypothesis is that the dual principles of re-usability and hierarchy, or what cognitive scientists call compositionality, form the foundation for efficient learning in biological systems. Re-usability and hierarchy are prominent architectural themes of the world around us, and it is logical that they would form the basis for our internal generative representations ("the mind's eye") as well. Using the tools of probability modeling and statistical inference, I study the implications of these ideas for representation and computation in the micro-circuitry of the brain as well as their applications to artificial vision systems.Learning in biological systems, measured by performance as a function of the number of training samples, is strikingly efficient when compared to artificial systems.

By accelerating and smashing particle beams at the highest achievable energies, accelerators enable us to explore the fundamental constituents of matter and provide important insight into the structure and evolution of the universe. The most powerful accelerator to date is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  It was conceived and built to address some of the most-exciting outstanding questions in fundamental physics, such as the origin of the masses of the elementary particles, the composition of the universe dark matter, the origin of the matter-antimatter imbalance in the universe, etc.  Gianotti was involved in the LHC project since the beginning (early \u201890s). She participated in the design and detector R&D and construction of the liquid-argon electromagnetic calorimeter for the ATLAS experiment, a device used to detect and measure electrons and photons with high precision. This detector was fundamental for the discovery, in 2012, of the Higgs boson, which is related to the mechanism by which elementary particles acquire a mass.  Her interests cover also developments of analysis methods and software tools, as well as data analysis up to the publication of the physics results.Gianotti\u2019s thirty-year-long scientific activity inscribes itself in the field of particle physics at high-energy accelerators.

VThe Giovannoni lab uses molecular, physiological and genetic approaches to investigate the molecular cascade underlying the coordinated biochemical and physiological changes that render fleshy fruit ripe. Fruit are significant components of human and animal diets contributing fiber, carbohydrates and essential nutrients. Using the tomato system they have uncovered key transcription factors initiating early ripening events upstream and controlling the ripening hormone ethylene. These include transcription factors underlying natural mutations or revealed through gene expression profiling. Some are widely conserved through the evolution of fleshy fruit bearing species with relevance to shelf-life, nutritional quality and food security. The lab has demonstrated that some of these transcription factors operate in the fruit in conjunction with developmental DNA methylation changes to facilitate the ripening transition only after the enclosed seed reach maturity. This tight regulation is essential to fitness. These analyses were facilitated in part by the laboratory\u2019s central role in the development and unrestricted release of tomato genomics resources including genome sequences that have facilitated plant biology investigations well beyond the fruit.The Giovannoni lab uses molecular, physiological and genetic approaches to investigate the molecular cascade underlying the coordinated biochemical and physiological changes that render fleshy fruit ripe.

VThe Glass laboratory has had a long-standing interest in elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which sequence specific transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors regulate the development and function of macrophages. A major focus has been on understanding the roles of nuclear hormone receptors and other signal dependent transcription factors in controlling programs of gene expression that underlie both their normal homeostatic functions in healthy tissues, as well as their pathogenic functions in the arterial wall, adipose tissue and brain. Recent work from the laboratory uncovered the importance of tissue-specific signals in establishing the diverse macrophage phenotypes observed in different organs. Current studies use a combination of genetics and genomics to define general molecular mechanisms that establish macrophage identity and cell-specific responses to homeostatic and pathogenic signals in both mouse models and human subjects. His laboratory is currently applying these approaches to understand and modify pathological programs of macrophage gene expression that promote the development of atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.The Glass laboratory has had a long-standing interest in elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which sequence specific transcription factors, co-activators and co-repressors regulate the development and function of macrophages.

VI have worked my entire career to further our understanding of the internal dynamics of planets and stars by developing and using computer models that numerically simulate the heat transfer, fluid flow and magnetic field generation in these bodies.  My original research focused on stars, and in particular the solar dynamo and its magnetic cycle.  I then became interested in studying the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere and then its mantle.  Later I focused deeper within the Earth and produced the first 3D self-consistent simulations of the convection and magnetic field generation in the Earth's liquid iron core, i.e., the geodynamo, with spontaneous magnetic dipole reversals.  This led to our prediction of the super-rotation of the Earth's solid inner core, which was later inferred via seismic observations.  More recently I have investigated, again by computer simulation, fluid flows and magnetic fields in giant gas planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, and in their icy satellites, Europa and Titan.  I am now coming full circle by improving our original models of the solar dynamo.  My main frustration, however, is that there never seems to be enough time to work on many of the interesting problems I would love to tackle.I have worked my entire career to further our understanding of the internal dynamics of planets and stars by developing and using computer models that numerically simulate the heat transfer, fluid flow and magnetic field generation in these bodies.

VDr. Goldberg\u2019s laboratory has long been a center for research into the biochemical mechanisms and physiological importance of protein breakdown in cells in normal and pathological states. The major focus of their present research concerns the detailed mechanisms by which the 26S proteasome catalyzes the rapid degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. One goal of these studies is to understand how the ubiquitin proteasome pathway selectively degrades misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins as cause the major neurodegerative diseases, and to find methods to activate this degradative process in order to enhance the clearance of such potentially toxic proteins. Other studies are investigating how the overall rate of protein degradation is accelerated in certain pathological conditions, such as muscle atrophy as results from disuse, denervation, or various systemic disease (especially, cancer). His laboratory is also exploring how cells respond to proteasome inhibitors and compensate for decreased proteasome function by inducing the production of new proteasomes or activating autophagy. Another long term interest of Dr. Goldberg\u2019s lab concerns the simpler ATP-dependent proteases that eliminate misfolded proteins in bacteria. Ongoing studies are attempting to identify selective inhibitors of these novel enzymes, which might be useful as antimicrobial drugs, especially for treatment of tuberculosis.Dr. Goldberg\u2019s laboratory has long been a center for research into the biochemical mechanisms and physiological importance of protein breakdown in cells in normal and pathological states.

He received his AB degree and PhD in Physiology from Harvard University, after attending Cambridge University as a Churchill Scholar and Harvard Medical School. His important discoveries have concerned the mechanisms and regulation of protein breakdown in cells. His laboratory first demonstrated the non-lysosomal pathway for protein breakdown, now termed the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. They also discovered the involvement of the 26S proteasomes in this process and the ATP-dependent proteases responsible for proteolysis in bacteria. Also of wide impact have been his studies showing that this pathway is critical in clearance of misfolded proteins, in muscle atrophy, and in antigen presentation to the immune system. He and his colleagues introduced the proteasome inhibitors widely used as research tools, and he initiated development of the proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib/Velcade, now used worldwide to treat multiple myeloma.

VMy research program investigates photosynthetic metabolism and the mechanism of a biological circadian clock using a cyanobacterial model organism. In the 1980s I developed genetic tools for the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus that enabled my group to address how the genes involved in photosynthesis are regulated by light. In the early 1990s we applied these genetic methods in S. elongatus to discover the molecular components of the only known bacterial circadian (24-h) biological clock. With our collaborators we identified three novel proteins that form a 24-h biochemical oscillation that underpins the cyanobacterial circadian clock. We contributed genetic, biochemical, and structural insights into the function of the clock. My lab is now focused on how the oscillator generates circadian rhythms of gene expression and cell division, and how day/night cues are interpreted by the cell to synchronize the internal clock with the external solar day. Cyanobacteria and other microalgae are currently of interest for their potential for the sustainable production of biofuels and industrial feedstocks. We are now applying our insights into the genetics and metabolism of S. elongatus to facilitate the exploitation of cyanobacteria for biotechnological goals.My research program investigates photosynthetic metabolism and the mechanism of a biological circadian clock using a cyanobacterial model organism.

VI am a theoretical physicist studying collective phenomena, statistical physics and non-equilibrium pattern formation in condensed matter, fluids and biology. In early work on the high temperature superconductors, my analysis of experimental data indicated that electrons form pairs in the d-wave angular momentum state, and uncovered the scaling behavior near the transition between normal and superconducting states. Using novel mathematical and computational methods, I have explored how patterns of nature arise through the interplay between transport processes, such as diffusion or convection, and nonlinear dynamics, such as surface-tension influenced interface motion occurring at solid-melt boundaries. Examples studied include the growth of snowflakes and dendrites in metals, the dynamics of landscapes at geothermal hot springs, and the kinetics of phase ordering in superfluids. Driven fluids are usually encountered in the turbulent state, and my recent research has shown how small-scale statistical fluctuations in velocity determine macroscopic flow properties of interest for engineering applications, such as the friction experienced when a fluid flows through a pipeline. Currently my group is studying collective effects in evolution and ecology, ranging from the evolution of the genetic code through horizontal transfer of genes to the fluctuation-driven patterns of plankton in the oceans.I am a theoretical physicist studying collective phenomena, statistical physics and non-equilibrium pattern formation in condensed matter, fluids and biology.

VMy laboratory studies cell motility and protein synthesis. Motor proteins and GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) share many structural and functional attributes. Molecular motors myosin, dynein and kinesin are prototype biological energy transducers that power many cell biological motions such as targeted vesicle transport and cell division. The ribosome translates codons in messenger RNAs into amino acid sequences with enormous speed and fidelity. Energy from splitting GTP by G-protein elongation factors (EFs) is transformed into translational accuracy and maintenance of the reading frame. We relate the structural changes in these macromolecules to the chemical and mechanical steps of the energy transduction mechanism by mapping the real-time domain motions and kinetics of the motor proteins and ribosomal elongation factors. We have developed and apply novel biophysical methods including laser photolysis of caged substrates, for instance caged ATP, nanometer tracking of position and orientation of single fluorescent probes and ultra-fast feedback infrared optical traps. The biophysical mechanisms of stepping along these machines\u2019 tracks, how they are optimized for their various specific roles in the cell, and how they work together in teams are some of the outstanding research questions and areas of progress.My laboratory studies cell motility and protein synthesis.

We relate the structural changes in these macromolecules to the chemical and mechanical steps of the energy transduction mechanism by mapping the real-time domain motions and kinetics of the motor proteins and ribosomal elongation factors. We have developed and apply novel biophysical methods including laser photolysis of caged substrates, for instance caged ATP, nanometer tracking of position and orientation of single fluorescent probes and ultra-fast feedback infrared optical traps. The biophysical mechanisms of stepping along these machines\u2019 tracks, how they are optimized for their various specific roles in the cell, and how they work together in teams are some of the outstanding research questions and areas of progress.My laboratory studies cell motility and protein synthesis. Motor proteins and GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) share many structural and functional attributes.

Gravitational waves were first observed by the Advanced LIGO detectors in September 2015, produced by the merging of two black holes more than a billion years ago. Since then, a few other signals produced by similar systems have been detected. Improving the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors is critical to be able to observe signals that were originated farther away, to increase the rate of the observations, and to observe gravitational waves from new phenomena like the merger of neutron stars.Gabriela González\u2019 group at LSU, funded by the National Science Foundation, works on the data calibration and characterization for the LIGO detectors in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA, as well as on developing experimental techniques for diagnosing and improving the sensitivity of the detectors.

VMy lab and I use brewer's yeast as a model organism to uncover the mechanistic details underlying curious biological phenomena. Initially we focused on our discovery of "telomere position effect", where genes located in proximity to chromosome ends produce a phenotype that is heritable for many generations, but at some frequency, reversible. Applying a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches we developed a mechanistic understanding of this type of "epigenetic" regulation of gene expression, identifying molecules that switch a gene to the heritable "off" state, as well as explaining how the state can be switched back "on". These studies also took us into unexpected directions, including the discovery and characterization of the telomerase RNA in yeast, the critical template component for replicating the ends of chromosomes. More recently, I am interested in the process of cellular aging, which is defined in yeast by the finite number of divisions a "mother" cell goes through. To facilitate these studies, we developed technologies to more easily identify and characterize aging phenotypes. Applying this, we have identified a series of causally-linked events that define the aging process, and defining how they are impacted by environment and genetics.My lab and I use brewer's yeast as a model organism to uncover the mechanistic details underlying curious biological phenomena.

VThe work in the Gouaux Lab is concentrated on developing molecular mechanisms for the function of receptors and transporters at chemical synapses. At chemical synapses, neurotransmitters released from one neuron diffuse throughout a small space-the synaptic cleft-to receptors on adjacent neurons. At many synapses, the neurotransmitter binds to a receptor that is a ligand-gated ion channel, and this binding event leads to the opening of a transmembrane pore, which in turn results in depolarization of the nerve cell and generation of an electrical signal. Neurotransmitter transporters surrounding the synapse clear the transmitters from the cleft by coupling the thermodynamically unfavorable uptake to the favorable co-transport of one or more sodium ions.The work in the Gouaux Lab is concentrated on developing molecular mechanisms for the function of receptors and transporters at chemical synapses.

VShiv Grewal\u2019s laboratory investigates conserved pathways involved in epigenetic genome control and assembly of heterochromatin, a specialized form of chromatin that impacts diverse cellular processes, including trans-generational inheritance of gene expression states, chromosome architecture, and the maintenance of genome stability.

VShiv Grewal is a Distinguished Investigator at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) recognized for groundbreaking research in the field of epigenetics. His work provided fundamental insight into heterochromatin formation, a compact form of chromatin that inhibits inappropriate gene expression and ensures genome stability. He obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1992, where he held the prestigious Cambridge-Nehru scholarship. As a post-doctoral fellow at NCI he discovered that heterochromatic gene silencing can be stably propagated as epigenetic states through meiosis and inherited in cis. Grewal joined Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory faculty in 1998, where he uncovered a surprising connection between RNAi and heterochromatin assembly that was named \u201cBreakthrough of the Year 2002\u201d by Science. In 2003, Grewal returned to the NCI as a Senior Investigator and was appointed Chief of the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2011. His work has elucidated how heterochromatin is assembled in different parts of the genome and revealed its diverse genome regulatory functions. Three of his papers are judged historic discoveries in the past 50 years by Nature. Grewal is the recipient of the Newcomb-Cleveland Prize, NIH Merit Award, and the NIH Directors\u2019 award. In 2014, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Shiv Grewal is a Distinguished Investigator at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) recognized for groundbreaking research in the field of epigenetics.

VSten Grillner has unravelled the intrinsic function of the modular network organization underlying fundamental aspects of our motor repertoire. His initial work defined the basic organisation of the mammalian locomotor system in terms of supraspinal command systems, spinal networks coordinating the movements (CPGs), and the sensory control of the CPGs. To address the next level question - the molecular, cellular and synaptic design of these neuronal circuits - he developed a novel and simpler vertebrate model (lamprey). The different network interneurons, their synaptic interaction (transmitters, receptor subtypes), and their membrane properties (ion channel subtypes expressed) have been identified. The palette of different subtypes of ion channels expressed in different neurones is found to be of critical importance for network function. Through an interaction between detailed multi-faceted experimentation and large scale modelling with biophysically realistic numbers of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, the operation of this entire motor control system has been uncovered. This conserved system is understood at a cellular/molecular level, and the conceptual gap between gene/molecule and behaviour has been bridged. We now understand the design of the neuronal subsystems coordinating goal-directed ambulation. In focus is now the forebrain systems that are responsible for selection of different patterns of behavior.Sten Grillner has unravelled the intrinsic function of the modular network organization underlying fundamental aspects of our motor repertoire.

VTim Grove is a geologist interested in the processes that have led to the chemical evolution of the Earth and other planets including the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and meteorite parent bodies. His approach to understanding planetary differentiation is to combine field, petrologic, and geochemical studies of igneous rocks with high pressure, high temperature experimental petrology. On Earth his research focuses on mantle melting and subsequent crustal-level magma differentiation at both mid-ocean ridges and subduction zones. For mid-ocean ridges, he is interested in the influence of mantle convection and lithospheric cooling on melt generation and modification. In subduction zone environments, he is interested in understanding the critical role of H2O on melting and differentiation processes. On the Moon, his work focuses on understanding the chemical differentiation of the early lunar magma ocean and the subsequent remelting of its cumulates to create lunar mare basalts. He applies his experimental approach to meteorites from the earliest formed planetesimals in our Solar System to understand the melting and chemical differentiation processes that occurred in these asteroidal bodies.Tim Grove is a geologist interested in the processes that have led to the chemical evolution of the Earth and other planets including the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and meteorite parent bodies.

VUsing a combination of instrument design, wetlab experiments, computation and analytical theory, the Gruebele group studies the dynamics of complex systems. Dynamics at glass surfaces is investigated using scanning microscopy time-lapse movies. Single molecule optical absorption and energy transfer in nanostructures is studied by laser-assisted scanning microscopy. Video imaging, combined with 'parameter free' analysis is used to study the locomotion of organisms from bacteria to zebrafish. Protein and RNA dynamics are studied both in vitro and under the crowded conditions inside cells, using techniques such as laser T-jump, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, pressure jumps, X-ray crystallography, full atom molecular dynamics simulations, and simple diffusion or analytical models.  The in vitro work detected downhill or near-downhill folding proteins, whose fast folding facilitates observation of full refolding in atomistic simulations.  The in-cell work highlights how organisms can modulate their protein phenotype and exert additional control over proteins post-translation. In addition, the Gruebele group has studied in detail analytical and numerical models of energy flow within molecules, and complemented this work with laser spectroscopy to understand how slow energy flow can allow the control of molecular reactivity.Using a combination of instrument design, wetlab experiments, computation and analytical theory, the Gruebele group studies the dynamics of complex systems.

VMore than 2 billion people are iron-deficient because their plant-based diets are not a rich source of iron. Our research has identified key players involved in the mobilization of iron from the soil to the seed, including the FRO2 ferric chelate reductase that catalyzes the rate limiting step at the root-soil interface; a divalent cation transporter, IRT1, essential for iron uptake from the soil; FRD3, an effluxer necessary for movement of iron from the root to the shoot and VIT1 that transports iron into the vacuole from where it can be mobilized by germinating seeds. We have helped to define the field of ionomics, an innovative combination of high throughput elemental analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), with bioinformatics, molecular genetics and ecology, providing a new conceptual framework for plant mineral nutrition. To overcome some of the historic limitations in studying metal distribution in plants, we have pioneered the use of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy to simultaneously map the distribution of multiple elements at the cellular and sub-cellular levels. We have learned that mis-localization of iron in the seed has profound consequences for seedling viability. Our work uncovered a fundamental aspect of seed biology that will ultimately aid the development of nutrient-rich seed, benefiting both human health and agricultural productivity.More than 2 billion people are iron-deficient because their plant-based diets are not a rich source of iron.

Our work uncovered a fundamental aspect of seed biology that will ultimately aid the development of nutrient-rich seed, benefiting both human health and agricultural productivity.

VI am interested in optics at the nanoscale, in particular, how we can use metallic structures of subwavelength dimensions to manipulate light and harness the energy of photons in new ways.  The fundamental mechanism to achieve this is the collective electronic excitations of metals, known as surface plasmons.  As a complement to optical sources with tunable wavelengths, I have developed optical materials whose absorption and scattering properties could be tuned just as systematically.  I invented the first tunable plasmon-resonant nanoparticle, a core-shell geometry that I named a "nanoshell": a nanoparticle whose properties were first predicted theoretically more than four decades prior to our physical realization of this structure.  The creation of tunable plasmonic nanoparticles directly stimulated a new theoretical picture for coupled plasmons known as plasmon hybridization, developed with theory collaborator Peter Nordlander.  This was the conceptual breakthrough that enabled us to develop a wide range of coupled nanoparticle systems with tunable optical properties including coherent plasmonic phenomena.  I am also pursuing the use of plasmonic nanoparticles in applications that may benefit society, from photothermal cancer therapy and chemical and biomolecular sensing to photocatalysis and direct steam generation using sunlight and light-absorbing nanoparticles.I am interested in optics at the nanoscale, in particular, how we can use metallic structures of subwavelength dimensions to manipulate light and harness the energy of photons in new ways.  The fundamental mechanism to achieve this is the collective electronic excitations of metals, known as surface plasmons.  As a complement to optical sources with tunable wavelengths, I have developed optical materials whose absorption and scattering properties could be tuned just as systematically.  I invented the first tunable plasmon-resonant nanoparticle, a core-shell geometry that I named a "nanoshell": a nanoparticle whose properties were first predicted theoretically more than four decades prior to our physical realization of this structure.  The creation of tunable plasmonic nanoparticles directly stimulated a new theoretical picture for coupled plasmons known as plasmon hybridization, developed with theory collaborator Peter Nordlander.  This was the conceptual breakthrough that enabled us to develop a wide range of coupled nanoparticle systems with tunable optical properties including coherent plasmonic phenomena.  I am also pursuing the use of plasmonic nanoparticles in applications that may benefit society, from photothermal cancer therapy and chemical and biomolecular sensing to photocatalysis and direct steam generation using sunlight and light-absorbing nanoparticles.I am interested in optics at the nanoscale, in particular, how we can use metallic structures of subwavelength dimensions to manipulate light and harness the energy of photons in new ways.  The fundamental mechanism to achieve this is the collective electronic excitations of metals, known as surface plasmons.  As a complement to optical sources with tunable wavelengths, I have developed optical materials whose absorption and scattering properties could be tuned just as systematically.  I invented the first tunable plasmon-resonant nanoparticle, a core-shell geometry that I named a "nanoshell": a nanoparticle whose properties were first predicted theoretically more than four decades prior to our physical realization of this structure.  The creation of tunable plasmonic nanoparticles directly stimulated a new theoretical picture for coupled plasmons known as plasmon hybridization, developed with theory collaborator Peter Nordlander.  This was the conceptual breakthrough that enabled us to develop a wide range of coupled nanoparticle systems with tunable optical properties including coherent plasmonic phenomena.  I am also pursuing the use of plasmonic nanoparticles in applications that may benefit society, from photothermal cancer therapy and chemical and biomolecular sensing to photocatalysis and direct steam generation using sunlight and light-absorbing nanoparticles.

VThe disparate plant groups comprising genus Rhododendron have a global distribution that accurately reflects major geologic events of the Cenozoic era, including collision of India with S. Asia, northward movement of the Australian plate and collision of Wrangellia with N. America. Many Rhododendron species inhabit East Asia and the North Pacific rim, while Europe and central regions of North America are relatively species-poor. In recent years, Benjamin Hall\u2019s laboratory has increasingly used DNA sequence data--first of genes, and now of genomes\u2014to answer phylogenetic and biogeographic questions associated with the spread and evolutionary divergence of Rhododendron species in East and SE Asia and in the Pacific Northwest. At present, the clearest evolutionary trajectory is that of Rhododendron subgenus Hymenanthes, a taxon with evergreen, broad smooth leaves. From an origin in NE China, Hymenanthes diversified to about 300 species while spreading southwestward to higher elevation regions in and around the Himalayas. Besides these, there is also a smaller group of basal Hymenanthes species, each of them native to a specific area in Eastern or Western North America, NE Asia, or Asia Minor. Genomic DNA analyses of both the 300 East Asian and the 10 geographically dispersed basal Hymenanthes species reveal the historical interplay between tectonic events and Rhododendron migration and evolution.The disparate plant groups comprising genus Rhododendron have a global distribution that accurately reflects major geologic events of the Cenozoic era, including collision of India with S.

VBenjamin Hall graduated from the University of Kansas in 1954, majoring in Chemistry. He then completed graduate studies at Harvard University, receiving a doctoral degree in Biophysical Chemistry in 1958. His thesis research described and named the two major RNAs (18S and 28S) of the ribosome. During his initial faculty appointment at the University of Illinois (1958-63) he initiated physical studies of the RNA molecules made in T-even phage-infected E. coli and devised specific molecular hybridization techniques that showed these RNAs to be complementary in sequence to the bacteriophage DNA. In 1963 He moved to the Department of Genetics at the University of Washington where he developed a research program directed toward understanding transcription by RNA Polymerases II and III in the yeast S. cerevisiae. This culminated in 1981 in two inventions that established Saccharomyces as the organism of choice for the production of vaccines (against Hepatitis B and Human Papilloma viruses) and other proteins of pharmaceutical interest, among them, insulin. Since 1995, Professor Hall has studied the molecular systematics of fungi and of flowering plants, initially using the sequences of moderately conserved proteins of the transcription apparatus as an evolutionary metric.

VMichael N. Hall studies cell growth control and, in particular, the TOR (Target of Rapamycin) signaling network in yeast and mammals. He discovered the highly conserved, nutrient-activated protein kinase TOR in the early 1990's, and subsequently elucidated its role as a central controller of cell growth. His subsequent studies include the discovery of the two structurally and functionally distinct TOR complexes (TORC1 and TORC2) and the description of the two signaling pathways mediated by these two complexes. The two TOR complexes, like TOR itself, are highly conserved. Thus, the two TOR complexes constitute an ancestral signaling network conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution to control the fundamental process of cell growth. The discovery of TOR led to a fundamental change in how one thinks of cell growth. It is not a spontaneous process that just happens when building blocks (nutrients) are available, but rather a highly regulated, plastic process controlled by TOR-dependent signaling pathways. More recently, he found that mammalian TOR (mTOR) signaling in metabolic organs controls whole body growth and metabolism. As a central controller of growth and metabolism, TOR plays a key role in development and aging, and is implicated in disorders such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.Michael N.

VAlex Halliday is an isotope geochemist who develops mass spectrometry techniques and applies them to the origin and early evolution of the terrestrial planets.  He also conducts studies of mantle melting, magmatic systems, mineral and hydrocarbon deposits, ocean chemistry, continental erosion and the origins of planetary volatiles. Recognising the potential of multiple collector inductively coupled mass spectrometry in particular, his group developed methods for determining precise levels of natural mass dependent fractionation in silicon, vanadium, nickel, tungsten, thallium and uranium, in addition to developing other isotopic systems.  Among diverse discoveries, Halliday and others found, by using the decay of hafnium-182 to tungsten-182, that Earth took tens of millions of years to accrete, culminating in the Moon forming event after more than thirty million years. In contrast asteroidal sized objects and Mars formed within just a few million years. Halliday also demonstrated that silicon is a likely light element in Earth\u2019s core based on the first evidence of metal-silicate isotopic fractionation. He also showed that the oxygen isotopic composition of Earth and Moon are indistinguishable to very high levels of precision providing evidence endorsed by other isotopic systems, that the Moon\u2019s atoms were derived from, or equilibrated with, those of Earth.Alex Halliday is an isotope geochemist who develops mass spectrometry techniques and applies them to the origin and early evolution of the terrestrial planets.  He also conducts studies of mantle melting, magmatic systems, mineral and hydrocarbon deposits, ocean chemistry, continental erosion and the origins of planetary volatiles.

VMy main research areas are in quantum optics and experimental quantum information science. I have made many contributions to Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics, the branch of quantum optics studying the interactions of single atoms with photons inside high-Q quality factor cavities. With my research team, we have demonstrated the enhancement of single atom spontaneous emission in a cavity (1983) and observed the decoherence of mesoscopic superpositions of field states containing several photons (so-called  cat states) (1996).

VMy research interests are centered on social inequality, specializing in the substantive areas of family, poverty, and health. In the early part of my career, I studied the inter-relationships among family, poverty, and social policy, including such topics as teenage parenthood, nonmartial childbearing, single-mother families, absent fathers, outcomes for poor children, and the causes and consequences of welfare dependency. My research informed the development of the 1996 Welfare Reform Law that included support for work among the low-income population. When I became PI and Director of Add Health, a longitudinal study of over 20,000 teens being followed into adulthood, my research focused on health disparities among immigrant, single-mother, minority, and poor families. In my efforts to map social stratification pathways that lead to health disparities, I pioneered an integrative multidisciplinary design and research program to understand social, environmental, behavioral, biological and genetic linkages in developmental and health trajectories across the life course. I have argued forcefully for studying health among the young to identify markers of health risk before disease is manifest to save social, emotional, and financial costs to individuals, families, and society. My publications appear in multiple disciplinary journals in demography, genetics, family, sociology, epidemiology, biology, public policy, survey methodology, medicine, and social and health behavior.My research interests are centered on social inequality, specializing in the substantive areas of family, poverty, and health.

VSince virtually all important geophysical processes involve significant changes to crustal heat flow (e.g., thrusting, rifting, magmatism), understanding the thermal history of the lithosphere is akin to understanding its geologic evolution. My research is characterized by efforts to develop and apply thermochronometry to understand previously hidden aspects of Earth history. Our initial approach was to use isotopic variations in radioactive mineral systems to empirically calibrate closure temperatures using laboratory-based diffusion laws. This led to the recognition that continuous, high-accuracy thermal histories could be extracted via intragrain isotopic gradients and the multidiffusion domain model was born. With the progressive refinement of this method, the need arose for field testing under extreme geologic conditions requiring the highest attainable resolution. Thus we turned our attention to the Himalayan-Tibetan mountains revealing hitherto unrecognized tectonic activity. More recently, my attention turned to a unique resource -- zircons as old as nearly 4.4 billion years -- to probe the first 500 million years of Earth history, a period for which no rock record is known. As a consequence of this on-going work, the perception of earliest Earth has changed from the certainty of a hellish world hostile to life to perhaps something more akin to the modern planet.Since virtually all important geophysical processes involve significant changes to crustal heat flow (e.g., thrusting, rifting, magmatism), understanding the thermal history of the lithosphere is akin to understanding its geologic evolution.

VOliver Hart has for many years been interested in why parties write contracts that are incomplete, in the sense that they contain gaps and ambiguities. Economic theorists have found it hard to explain this under the assumption that people are fully rational. Hart has incorporated some ideas from behavioral economics to make progress. The idea is that one role of a contract is to get parties on the same page. If parties have different expectations about what will happen during their relationship they are likely to be disappointed and this can lead to bad feeling and withholding of cooperation. A contract, by delimiting the set of future options, can bring parties\u2019 expectations into line. Unfortunately, getting people on the same page may require some rigidity in the contract and this may make it harder for them to adjust to future events. This approach can throw light on the nature of the employment relationship and on why firms respond to demand shocks by laying off workers rather than cutting wages. As well as pursuing this topic theoretically, Hart has recently tested some of the underlying behavioral assumptions in the lab.Oliver Hart has for many years been interested in why parties write contracts that are incomplete, in the sense that they contain gaps and ambiguities.

VOliver Hart works at the intersection of economics, finance, and law. His thesis was on the existence and optimality of competitive equilibrium when some markets are missing. Since then he has worked mainly on the economics of contracts, with a particular focus on situations where contracts are incomplete and a key question is how residual control rights\u2014the right to make decisions unspecified in the contract\u2014are allocated. He has applied these ideas to understanding the nature and boundaries of firms, the allocation of power between the providers and users of capital, the optimality of one share-one vote, and the importance of collateral in determining a firm\u2019s financial capacity. Hart was born in London, and graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in mathematics, from Warwick University with an M.A. in economics, and from Princeton University with a PhD in economics. He taught at the Universities of Essex and Cambridge, and at LSE, before taking positions at MIT and then at Harvard, where he has been since 1993.

VResearch in my laboratory is centered on the role of molecular chaperones in protein folding in health and disease. Using mitochondria as a model system, we were able to show in the late 1980s that molecular chaperones like Hsp60 mediate the basic process of polypeptide chain folding in an ATP-dependent reaction (collaborative work with A. Horwich and W. Neupert). We then investigated the mechanism of the bacterial Hsp60, GroEL, and found that it functions together with GroES as a cage-like compartment, allowing the folding of single protein molecules to proceed unimpaired by aggregation. We also reconstituted the conserved cytosolic folding pathway in which the Hsp70 and Hsp60 chaperone systems cooperate sequentially. In other research we demonstrated the significance of co-translational domain folding as a process of particular importance in the biogenesis of large multi-domain proteins in eukaryotes. In recent years we have investigated the role of molecular chaperones in the defense against toxic protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases. Most recently, in collaboration with M. Hayer-Hartl, we have investigated the folding and assembly of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme in plants that catalyzes the production of biomass from atmospheric carbon dioxide. This work has led to the discovery of a specific assembly chaperone for Rubisco that acts downstream of GroEL.Research in my laboratory is centered on the role of molecular chaperones in protein folding in health and disease.

We also reconstituted the conserved cytosolic folding pathway in which the Hsp70 and Hsp60 chaperone systems cooperate sequentially. In other research we demonstrated the significance of co-translational domain folding as a process of particular importance in the biogenesis of large multi-domain proteins in eukaryotes. In recent years we have investigated the role of molecular chaperones in the defense against toxic protein aggregation in neurodegenerative diseases. Most recently, in collaboration with M. Hayer-Hartl, we have investigated the folding and assembly of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco), the enzyme in plants that catalyzes the production of biomass from atmospheric carbon dioxide. This work has led to the discovery of a specific assembly chaperone for Rubisco that acts downstream of GroEL.Research in my laboratory is centered on the role of molecular chaperones in protein folding in health and disease. Using mitochondria as a model system, we were able to show in the late 1980s that molecular chaperones like Hsp60 mediate the basic process of polypeptide chain folding in an ATP-dependent reaction (collaborative work with A. Horwich and W. Neupert).

VDennis L. Hartmann works on a broad range of subjects within the atmospheric sciences, particularly focused on variability and change of Earth\u2019s climate. A strong focus has been natural variability that originates in the climate system associated with eddy-jet interactions in the troposphere and stratosphere. Eddy-jet interactions in the troposphere give rise to large-amplitude, low-frequency variability in westerly winds that have significant effects on the stratosphere above and the ocean below. Another focus of research is the effect of clouds on Earth\u2019s radiative energy balance and on climate change. Cloud tops tend to rise to keep a relatively constant temperature as the climate warms, especially in the Tropics, which results in a positive longwave cloud feedback, making surface temperature more sensitive to natural or human-caused climate forcing. A negative climate feedback can result when ice clouds at high latitudes convert to liquid water in a warmed climate. The changed heating gradient associated with more reflective liquid clouds in high latitudes can induce an increase in westerly wind speed in middle latitudes, thus coupling the microphysics of clouds to the global circulation of the atmosphere.Dennis L.

VMary E. Hatten uses the mouse cerebellar cortex as a model to study molecular mechanisms of CNS neurogenesis and neuronal migration. She pioneered live imaging methods that proved that CNS neurons migrate on glial fibers and revealed a specific, conserved mode of CNS neuronal migration along glial fibers in different cortical regions. Subsequently, she used bioassays to identify key molecular regulators of neuronal migration, including the neuron-glial adhesion ligand Astn1 and the polarity complex mPar6, which coordinates cytoskeletal dynamics during cerebellar granule neuron migration. Using mouse genetics and in vitro chimeras, she discovered that the cerebellar territory arises from rhombomere 1 and that the weaver (Girk2) gene acts non-autonomously in granule cells. Her lab generated the first cDNA libraries from an identified CNS neuron, the cerebellar granule neuron, which she used to identify more than 80 genes that function in cerebellar development. Her research has broad significance for human genetic studies on developmental brain disorders, such as autism, attention deficit disorder, and childhood epilepsy.Mary E.

VSheng Yang He\u2019s laboratory is interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of plant disease susceptibility and bacterial pathogenesis.  They have used the Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae pathosystem to learn basic principles that underlie plant susceptibility to bacterial pathogens. P. syringae is representative of a large number of bacterial pathogens that infect the above-ground parts of plants.  During infection, this pathogen produces a battery of virulence factors (such as effector proteins and phytotoxins) to engage multiple host cell types (e.g., stomatal guard cells in the epidermis and mesophyll cells inside the plant). Their studies on the molecular action of bacterial effectors and the jasmonate-mimicking phytotoxin coronatine led to insight into a number of fundamental aspects of disease susceptibility, jasmonate hormone signaling, and the immune function of stomata in plants. Recently, their research begins to address next-level questions such as reconstitution of plant disease susceptibility and characterization of multi-dimensional interactions between the environment, the microbiome, and disease.Sheng Yang He\u2019s laboratory is interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of plant disease susceptibility and bacterial pathogenesis.  They have used the Arabidopsis thaliana-Pseudomonas syringae pathosystem to learn basic principles that underlie plant susceptibility to bacterial pathogens.

P. syringae is representative of a large number of bacterial pathogens that infect the above-ground parts of plants.  During infection, this pathogen produces a battery of virulence factors (such as effector proteins and phytotoxins) to engage multiple host cell types (e.g., stomatal guard cells in the epidermis and mesophyll cells inside the plant).

VHeal was one of the founders of the modern field of environmental and resource economics. His 1970s work with Dasgupta showed how cutting edge microeconomics could be adapted and extended to provide a systematic framework for thinking about the economics of environmental issues, and provided many of the underpinnings of the economics of sustainability. In the 1990s he developed this further and began recognizing the role played by natural systems in human wellbeing and incorporating natural systems into economic models as natural capital. His 2000 book and his 2004 report for the National Academy developed further a framework for incorporating ecosystems into an economic analysis of the environment. Subsequent work has focused on sustainability, both developing a conceptual framework for measuring sustainability and applying this. Heal has also played a major role in developing the economics of climate change, first writing on this in 1984: with Millner and Dietz he has developed a framework for incorporating uncertainty into this analysis, recognizing that uncertainty about outcomes under climate change is generally qualitative rather than quantitative. His work on climate change has focused mainly on the modeling of uncertainty and the selection of a discount rate. In addition to his environmental work, Heal has written on economic theory, specifically growth theory, general equilibrium theory and social choice theory.Heal was one of the founders of the modern field of environmental and resource economics.

VThe underlying theme in Arthur Hebard\u2019s research encompasses physical phenomena that emerge when solid-state thin films or thin-film interfaces become thin enough to be dominated by interactions unique to two dimensions (2D). At AT&T Bell Laboratories (1972-1996) Hebard\u2019s collaborative work included the development of a two-coil technique to measure the magnetic penetration length of 2D superconductors, the study of the Kosterlitz-Thouless 2D vortex-unbinding transition, the characterization of a new magnetic field driven 2D superconductor-insulator quantum phase transition, and the discovery of superconductivity in alkali-metal-doped carbon sixty (C60), both in bulk and in 2D. Hebard\u2019s work at the University of Florida (1996-present) addresses the effect of disorder on electrical transport in transition metal thin-film ferromagnets, ultimately revealing a well-defined critical disorder separating metallic from insulating states. Related projects include the study of magnetotransport and multiferroicity in thin-film complex oxides and, more recently, the use of transport and capacitance techniques to study interfaces between 2D materials with conventional semiconductors. The sensitivity of such interfaces to superconducting and charge density wave phase transitions promise new physical understanding along with possible technical applications.The underlying theme in Arthur Hebard\u2019s research encompasses physical phenomena that emerge when solid-state thin films or thin-film interfaces become thin enough to be dominated by interactions unique to two dimensions (2D).

VThe overall goal of our research is to understand the neural and molecular mechanisms that contribute to drug addiction, with the ultimate goal of providing targets for therapeutic intervention and diagnosis of risk factors. In the mid-nineties our laboratory introduced a new model organism to the field of drug addiction, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which provides unparalleled accessibility to genetic, behavioral and molecular analyses. At that time, we made two major assumptions: First, we assumed that the mechanisms by which drugs act in the nervous system to regulate behavior would be evolutionarily conserved. Thus, unbiased genetic screens -- made feasible by the ease, speed, and low cost of Drosophila research -- would provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-related behaviors in mammals. Second, we assumed that understanding relatively simple drug-induced behaviors, such as intoxication and tolerance, would provide insights into the more complex processes regulating drug reward and addiction in mammals. Indeed, the Drosophila studies have shown that behaviors induced by acute or intermittent drug exposure are surprisingly similar in flies and mammals, and that many of the genes, neurotransmitters and second messenger systems that mediate these behaviors are conserved. Thus, while the addiction-related studies in Drosophila are still relatively new, they strongly suggest that this simple model system will provide novel information that can be (and has been) transferred to mammals. More recently, we have developed more complex assays that allow us to measure "addiction like' behaviors in flies. These include assays for ethanol consumption and preference (feeding and drinking), relapse, and reward (conditioned odor preference). We are also beginning to study how prior experiences, such as social defeat and stress, affect ethanol preference and reward. Finally, we have developed Drosophila models for ethanol-induced neurotoxicity and fetal alcohol syndrome, and have found that some of the underlying mechanisms are conserved with mammals. As is the case in most areas of biology, having a good assay is the first and most crucial step needed before delving into the underlying mechanisms.The overall goal of our research is to understand the neural and molecular mechanisms that contribute to drug addiction, with the ultimate goal of providing targets for therapeutic intervention and diagnosis of risk factors.

VTimothy Heckman\u2019s work is observational and multi-waveband in nature, with an emphasis on spectroscopy in the visible and ultraviolet. He is interested in the understanding the physical processes that over the last 13 billion years have determined the properties of galaxies and their supermassive black holes. His early work showed that energetic activity associated with supermassive black holes is present at low levels in the nuclei of normal galaxies.

VStefan W. Hell is a physicist recognized for his pioneering research in far-field optical nanoscopy, also known as super-resolution microscopy. Hell was the first to demonstrate how one can decouple the resolution of a lens-based fluorescence microscope from diffraction and increase it down to a fraction of the wavelength of light, to the nanometer scale. Ever since the work of Ernst Abbe (1873) this feat had been believed impossible. After studies in Heidelberg (PhD in 1990) and postdoctoral work at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Hell laid out the principle of STED microscopy while on a research fellowship in Turku, Finland (1994). STED (standing for Stimulated Emission Depletion of the molecular fluorescent state) became the first viable proposal for a diffraction-unlimited fluorescence microscopy. The underlying idea, namely of discerning molecules (at subdiffraction length scales) by transiently preparing a subset of them in a non-signaling state, underlies all the practical diffraction-unlimited super-resolution fluorescence microscopy concepts to date. For these achievements and their significance for other fields, Hell has received numerous awards. In 2014 he shared the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Hell is a director at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen, and at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg (both Germany).Stefan W.

VI trained originally as a geneticist, and applied this training and the emerging techniques of molecular biology to elucidate the mechanisms of insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors of disease, at a time when these insects were far less tractable than the model organism Drosophila. I was then able to translate this information into simple biochemical and molecular assays that could be used to monitor the selection and spread of resistance in operational settings. With these tools in place, my laboratory designed and ran a seven year study to demonstrate the optimum resistance management strategy for a national malaria control programme to delay resistance, while still effectively reducing human disease prevalence. My laboratory was involved in the sequencing and analysis of the first mosquito genome and subsequently had significant roles in the Aedes and Culex genome sequencing and analysis. This allowed us to establish the full range of potential detoxification genes in mosquitoes and set up microarray analysis to reduce the time needed to identify the causal metabolic mechanism in an emerging resistance from years to months. Latterly I have used my extensive links with industry to found the first vector control product development partnership, the IVCC, stimulating the development of the first new public health pesticides for decades.I trained originally as a geneticist, and applied this training and the emerging techniques of molecular biology to elucidate the mechanisms of insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors of disease, at a time when these insects were far less tractable than the model organism Drosophila.

Over the past 30 years, his laboratory has developed and applied novel genetic, biochemical, and genomic methodologies to obtain a detailed understanding of the molecular components required for chromosome transmission in yeast, with the over-arching goal of relating his work in yeast to human cancer. Gene mutations causing a chromosome instability (CIN) phenotype in cancer cells represent a major predisposing condition in cancer initiation and/or progression. Current work in the Hieter laboratory includes a translational component, in which the extensive genome instability gene catalog that his laboratory has determined in yeast is being used to determine those genes that are somatically mutated and cause CIN in cancer. The Hieter laboratory then uses synthetic lethal genetic interaction data, based on yeast CIN genes whose human counterparts are mutated in cancers, to predict and validate novel drug targets for cancer therapy by a cross-species candidate approach.Dr Hieter is recognized for his work on structural and regulatory proteins that ensure faithful segregation of chromosomes during cell division.

VAlan Hinnebusch's laboratory investigates the process of translation initiation and mechanisms of general and gene-specific translational control, and the molecular basis of transcriptional activation and its role in nutrient control of gene expression, by exploiting the powerful genetic system of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  His laboratory elucidated the mechanism of translational control by eIF2 phosphorylation via upstream open reading frames in mRNAs, and is currently focused on the general mechanism of translation initiation, including recruitment of initiator tRNA and mRNA to the ribosome, ribosomal scanning of the mRNA, and accurate recognition of the AUG start codon. The roles of RNA helicases and accessory proteins in determining translational efficiencies genome-wide, and the structure and regulation of the eIF2 kinase Gcn2, also are under study. In the area of transcriptional control, his group helped to define the structure of transcriptional activation domains and their roles in cofactor recruitment, functions of cofactors in assembly of initiation complexes and transcription elongation, and cyclin-dependent kinases that phosphorylate RNA Polymerase II during the transcription cycle. They are currently focused on identifying the co-factors responsible for the remodeling and eviction of nucleosomes from gene promoters, as a key step in transcriptional activation, throughout the genome.Alan Hinnebusch's laboratory investigates the process of translation initiation and mechanisms of general and gene-specific translational control, and the molecular basis of transcriptional activation and its role in nutrient control of gene expression, by exploiting the powerful genetic system of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  His laboratory elucidated the mechanism of translational control by eIF2 phosphorylation via upstream open reading frames in mRNAs, and is currently focused on the general mechanism of translation initiation, including recruitment of initiator tRNA and mRNA to the ribosome, ribosomal scanning of the mRNA, and accurate recognition of the AUG start codon.

VAlan Hinnebusch is a molecular geneticist recognized for his work on mechanisms controlling gene expression at the translational and transcriptional levels.  He is particularly known for elucidating a dual regulatory response to nutrient starvation and stress involving the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2, which induces translation of transcription factors via short upstream open-reading-frames in their mRNAs while suppressing the translation of most genes. Hinnebusch was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1954 and grew up outside of Pittsburgh (Monroeville) and later in Canton, Ohio. He graduated from the University of Dayton with a degree in biology in 1975 and from Harvard University in 1980 with a Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology. He was a postdoctoral fellow studying yeast genetics with Gerald R. Fink, first at Cornell University and later at M.I.T., and became an independent investigator at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland in 1983. He is also a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Alan Hinnebusch is a molecular geneticist recognized for his work on mechanisms controlling gene expression at the translational and transcriptional levels.  He is particularly known for elucidating a dual regulatory response to nutrient starvation and stress involving the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2, which induces translation of transcription factors via short upstream open-reading-frames in their mRNAs while suppressing the translation of most genes.

VChemical and physical processes on solid surfaces are ubiquitous in nature and technology. By carrying out experiments in ultrahigh vacuum on single crystals to achieve well defined conditions and using surface sensitive probes, Ho and his laboratory seek to understand the fundamental properties of molecules and their transformations with sub-atomic spatial resolution. They have a long standing tradition of advancing precision measurements with homemade instruments. With their development of the scanning tunneling microscopes at low temperatures, it became possible to probe and image the interior of single molecules to reveal the spatial distributions of molecular orbitals, vibrational and spin excitations, and optical transitions. They have further developed an inelastic tunneling probe to obtain real space images of the molecular skeletal structure with chemical sensitivity. They are interested in the basic understanding of the mechanistic connection between molecular structure and function from spectral microscopy of single molecules. The approach by Ho and his laboratory is to achieve atomic-scale visualization of chemical and physical transformations at the single molecule level induced by electron and energy transfers, spin interactions, and environmental changes.Chemical and physical processes on solid surfaces are ubiquitous in nature and technology.

His goal is a theory which aids in the specification, design, development, testing and evolution of comprehensible, correct and efficient computer programs and systems. Recent progress in the research has led to presentations of the same theory in four styles: Geometric, Algebraic, Logical and Operational. (1)Geometry provides the format for diagrams by which the execution of a concurrent program test can be displayed to the programmer. Navigation of the diagram should assist in the interactive detection, location, diagnosis and correction of programming errors.

(3)Logic (in the form of Hoare triples) provides a language for specifying a program, and the interfaces between its parts. Its rules of deduction are intended to assure structural integrity of large program, and correctness of its critical parts. (4)The same logical rules are reinterpreted in the form of Milner transitions to specify operationally the individual step changes in the state of the executing machine.

VTony Hoare is a Computer Scientist, most famed for his invention in 1960 of Quicksort. His primary degree was in Philosophy, accompanied by Latin and Greek Languages, Literature and History. He holds a professional qualification as an interpreter from Russian to English, and as a Statistician. His main philosophical interests were in mathematical philosophy and epistemology; and he felt that the study of computers could be a source of illumination of age-old philosophical problems of human knowledge and intelligence. His first employment (1960) was as a programmer in the Computer Industry, where he designed an implementation for an innovative programming language ALGOL 60. On moving to academic life in 1968, he proposed a logic for mathematical verification of correctness of computer programs. His theory of concurrency in programming was reported in a well-known article on Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). It was the basis for the architecture of the INMOS transputer, the first mass-market single-chip networked computer. His subsequent research, in collaboration with He Jifeng, concentrated on Unifying Theories of Programming. On retirement from academic life in 1999, he joined Microsoft Research in Cambridge (UK). His current approach to a Unified Theory is based on a merger of elementary ideas from Geometry, Algebra and Logic.Tony Hoare is a Computer Scientist, most famed for his invention in 1960 of Quicksort.

VHopi Hoekstra\u2019s laboratory is interested in the genetic basis of evolutionary change. To this end, she has pioneered the use of wild rodents, primarily deer mice (genus Peromyscus), to study the molecular changes contributing to variation in a range of traits \u2013 from morphology to reproduction to behavior. Her early work focused on identifying mutations that give rise to cryptic coloration in mice that have repeatedly colonized novel habitat. This work became a textbook example of rapid adaptation, experimentally testing the adaptive value of camouflaging color to identifying mutations and developmental mechanisms responsible for color variation. She then extended this work to explore the mechanisms driving more complex color patterns, like rodent stripes. Building on her work in pigmentation biology, her laboratory also has explored the genetic basis of additional ecologically relevant phenotypes, including reproductive traits, such as sperm morphology and performance, driven by sexual selection. Finally, in recent years, her group has identified genes that affect behavior, and has used those genes to uncover the neurobiological and evolutional mechanisms driving behavioral evolution. Her research spans the fields of ecology, evolution, behavior, genetics, genomics, development and neurobiology, and is typified by its integrative nature \u2013 working in both the lab and field to make connections between genotype, phenotype and fitness.Hopi Hoekstra\u2019s laboratory is interested in the genetic basis of evolutionary change.

VThe study of the evolution of the human brain involves three different types of evidence. Comparative studies of neurological structure and function in different primates, particularly the apes, are indispensable for understanding what varies in different nervous systems and how these relate to behavior. This evidence is indirect because current apes are not ancestral to us. Two lines of evidence are direct, that of paleoneurology, and more recently neurogenomics. Endocasts, as in paleoneurological studies can only study the imprints left on the cranial interior surface; the interior structures such as fiber systems, neural nuclei, neurotransmitters, cannot be studied, thus paleoneurology has its limitations regarding the whole brain.  Paleoneurology can provide evidence regarding size, and sometimes can provide details regarding differences in cerebral organization, such as the reduction of primary visual cortex and the expansion of parietal association cortex. A major question is when the hominin brain become reorganized to a human-like pattern. All three approaches are necessary, but equally important is acquiring more evidence of how brains vary both in structure and behavior. Neurogenomics will hopefully be able to indicate which genetic patterns have undergone natural selection in the past and thus increase our understanding of how we evolved as a species.The study of the evolution of the human brain involves three different types of evidence.

This evidence is indirect because current apes are not ancestral to us. Two lines of evidence are direct, that of paleoneurology, and more recently neurogenomics. Endocasts, as in paleoneurological studies can only study the imprints left on the cranial interior surface; the interior structures such as fiber systems, neural nuclei, neurotransmitters, cannot be studied, thus paleoneurology has its limitations regarding the whole brain.  Paleoneurology can provide evidence regarding size, and sometimes can provide details regarding differences in cerebral organization, such as the reduction of primary visual cortex and the expansion of parietal association cortex. A major question is when the hominin brain become reorganized to a human-like pattern. All three approaches are necessary, but equally important is acquiring more evidence of how brains vary both in structure and behavior. Neurogenomics will hopefully be able to indicate which genetic patterns have undergone natural selection in the past and thus increase our understanding of how we evolved as a species.

VRalph Holloway is a biological anthropologist whose main interest is in paleoanthropology. His area of specialty deals with the evolution of the brain, particularly within paleoneurology, which involves the study of brain endocasts. These are casts made from the interior of fossil cranial remains which provide information regarding the size of the once living brain, cerebral asymmetries, gyral and sulcal patterns if present, and morphometric shape, in a comparative perspective. Holloway was born in Philadelphia, PA, first attending Drexel Institute of Technology, in metallurgical engineering. He finished his B.S. degree at the University of New Mexico majoring in Geology. His graduate work in physical anthropology was completed in 1964 at The University of California, Berkeley. He has taught at Columbia University in the Department of Anthropology since 1964, and has worked on fossil hominin cranial remains in Europe, Africa, and Indonesia.

VAs a mathematician I am interested in the way the conceptual framework of algebraic systems applies to problems in geometry, homotopy theory, number theory and mathematical physics. The main focus of my research is in the area of homotopy theory, which investigates the measurements of "shape" one can make, that are insensitive to continuous deformation of the underlying geometric structure. I have studied the theory of "nilpotence" in homotopy theory, and the relationship it creates between homotopy theory and algebraic geometry. Building on that my co-workers and I developed the theory of "topological modular forms" connecting the 19th theory of elliptic functions with the very modern abstractions of algebraic topology. Most recently I was part of a team that solved the longstanding "Kervaire invariant" problem, which describes obstructions to cutting up one shape and assembling the pieces into another.As a mathematician I am interested in the way the conceptual framework of algebraic systems applies to problems in geometry, homotopy theory, number theory and mathematical physics.

VI am a theoretical physicist studying both classical and quantum aspects of gravity. My research mostly focuses on questions involving gravity under the most extreme conditions. These include the big bang in cosmology and the spacetime inside black holes. According to general relativity, these are singularities -- regions where Einstein's field equation breaks down. A deeper understanding of singularities requires a quantum theory of gravity. String theory is a promising candidate for such a theory and predicts that space has more than three dimensions. I have found new higher dimensional black holes, and possible shapes for the extra spatial dimensions. I have also explored quantum properties of black holes and quantum descriptions of singularities. One of the most remarkable insights to come out of string theory is called gauge/gravity duality. This allows one to relate problems in gravitational physics to problems in nongravitational physics. I am currently using this new tool to better understand both quantum gravity and aspects of particle physics and condensed matter physics. In particular, I recently found a gravitational dual of a superconductor.I am a theoretical physicist studying both classical and quantum aspects of gravity.

VOur studies blend multiple scientific disciplines elucidating bacterial and host mechanisms that determine the onset, course and outcome of interactions between a host mucosal surface and bacterial pathogens. Using genetics, genomics, biochemistry, structural biology, high-resolution imaging, animal models, clinical studies and combinatorial chemistry, we have illuminated how bacterial intracellular lifestyles and community behaviors play critical roles in urinary tract infection (UTI). We uncovered principles of adhesive pili biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria of the chaperone/usher pathway; delineating molecular details of donor strand complementation and exchange mechanisms by which subunit folding is coupled with translocation and assembly of pili across the outer membrane. We delineated how uropathogenic E. coli use type 1 pili to invade and establish biofilm-like intracellular bacterial communities within bladder cells subverting extracellular host defenses and how quiescent intracellular reservoirs can seed recurrent infection. We identified complex networks governing mucosal epithelial responses that determine disease outcome. Further, we elucidated a mechanism by which bacteria form a directed biofilm-associated amyloid fiber called curli. Together, our work is changing the way UTIs are evaluated, re-shaping models of bacterial infections in general and spawning new technologies to design novel vaccines and anti-microbial therapeutics to diagnose, treat and/or prevent UTIs and their sequelae.Our studies blend multiple scientific disciplines elucidating bacterial and host mechanisms that determine the onset, course and outcome of interactions between a host mucosal surface and bacterial pathogens.

VI am primarily a theoretician, but also engage with relevant experiment. A long-standing interest has been in electron (or more generally, charge) transferin chemical systems, The kinetics of simple isotopic exchange reactions such as Fe*2+ / Fe3+ can be understood in terms of diabatic energy surfaces generated through electron-vibrational interaction (lambda) coupled through electronic interaction (J )to produce Born-Oppenheimer adiabatic surfaces. This two-site model for the ground state can be generalized to describe any donor-acceptor charge transfer. The vibronic coupling lambda can be to any number of internal modes (e.g. 100 in the bacterial photosynthetic radical cation) and medium (solution or crystal) modes. In the more general case where donor and acceptor are different species, there is an overall energy offset Eo to consider. In general, an optical transition to the upper adiabatic surface ( 'intervalence transfer') is allowed (giving rise to typical strong colours of mixed-valence systems) permitting values of the parameters lambda (and its individual contributions)) J and Eo to be deduced. Where donor and acceptor are linked through a bridging molecule, electronic properties depend critically on the ratio of J to lambda/2 , ranging from kinetically localized to single- minimum maximally quantum-entangled delocalized in the case of molecules, and from charge density wave through spin density wave to metallic behaviour in the solid state as the ratio approaches or surpasses unity. This coupled diabatic approach links in, for example, with general theories of chemical reaction dynamics, proton transfer, aromaticity and umbrella-type inversion (e.g. in ammonia). This work has progressed naturally to Molecular Electronics, where conduction through molecular wires linked to nanoelectrodes, principally ballistic but modulated by vibronic coupling, is considered. The dependence of conductivity and quantum interference effects on the structure of the molecular wire and details of links to the metal interfaces raise analogous problems. In this work, detailed quantum chemical calculations are needed, particularly to interpret Scanning Tunnelling Microscope and allied images. This connects with my long-standing interest in calculation of molecular properties, particularly response functions such as electronic and vibrational Stark effects.I am primarily a theoretician, but also engage with relevant experiment.

VAs a theoretical physical chemist, my research interests are understanding and predicting, at the microscopic level, the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions in solution and at surfaces, as well as phenomena allied to them, including reorientation, vibrational energy transfer and solvation dynamics. Methods employed include quantum chemistry, classical and quantum dynamics simulations, and (as often as possible) analytic modeling. Typically, we focus on reactions which involve transfer of charge, such as SN1 ionic dissociations, SN2 nuclear substitutions, acid-base proton transfer reactions, and electron transfer reactions, all occurring in a polar solvent, most often water; for such reactions and solvents, the microscopic dynamics will different considerably from those in the gas phase, due to strong electrostatic interactions. We attempt, to the extent possible, to connect our work to existing (and future) experiments exploring these reactions and phenomena. Examples include connecting reaction dynamics, as probed by ultrafast electronic spectroscopy, to dynamical solvent measures such as dielectric relaxation times, and connecting water reorientation dynamics to ultrafast multidimensional infrared spectroscopy signatures. In the past decade or so, we have extended our research to heterogeneous reactions related to atmospheric ozone depletion, Interstellar Medium prebiotic production of amino acids, biochemical enzymatic reactions, and water splitting catalysis important for solar energy conversion.As a theoretical physical chemist, my research interests are understanding and predicting, at the microscopic level, the rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions in solution and at surfaces, as well as phenomena allied to them, including reorientation, vibrational energy transfer and solvation dynamics.

VAs a theoretical and computational condensed-matter physicist, I have worked on developing new computational methods for electronic structure and the total energy of solids as well as applying them to study physical properties of various materials. Since the first such work, "momentum-space formalism for the total energy of solids" which was published in 1979, I continue to do research on the fundamental properties of solids and their applications to next-generation technologies. My study includes the electron transport and field emission in carbon nanotubes with various shapes and defect structures, the mechanical and electronic properties of wrinkled graphene caused by external stress, and anomalous transport properties of some exotic materials such as phase-change-memory materials and topological insulators. Since 2006, I have been a leader of a research team consisting of universities and industries aiming at developing safe and sufficient hydrogen-storage nanomaterials. Our team carries out research and development to theoretically design and experimentally synthesize hydrogen storage materials that can function under practical vehicle-operation conditions. We employ carbon-based nanomaterials decorated with transition metal atoms to store molecular hydrogen via relatively weak "Kubas" interaction mechanisms.As a theoretical and computational condensed-matter physicist, I have worked on developing new computational methods for electronic structure and the total energy of solids as well as applying them to study physical properties of various materials.

VMy research interests lie at the interface of chemistry and biology and my group exploits multidisciplinary approaches involving chemical synthesis, biophysical measurements, and biochemical methods to investigate fundamental problems in chemical biology. I am fascinated by post-translational protein modification reactions and, in particular, focus on understanding the chemical logic underpinning the membrane-associated biochemical processes that lead to enzyme-catalyzed asparagine-linked protein glycosylation, which is an essential transformation that is associated with all domains of life. N-linked glycosylation occurs via a complex and integrated sequence of enzymatic transformations that affords a key membrane-bound polyprenyldiphosphate-linked glycosyl donor and culminates with glycosyl transfer to protein catalyzed by the integral membrane enzyme oligosaccharyl transferase. Current research seeks to provide inhibitors as tools to probe the roles of glycosylation in pathogenic bacteria, methodological approaches for investigating the coordinated action of glycosylation pathway enzymes that function at the membrane interface, and active, monomeric OTases for detailed biochemical and biophysical analysis. My group also focuses on the design, synthesis and application of novel chemical tools for studying complex biological systems. In particular we have developed fluorescent and luminescent probes, which can play essential roles in biological studies for investigating protein phosphorylation and dynamic protein/protein interactions.My research interests lie at the interface of chemistry and biology and my group exploits multidisciplinary approaches involving chemical synthesis, biophysical measurements, and biochemical methods to investigate fundamental problems in chemical biology.

VIncandela\u2019s research is focused on finding evidence for physics beyond the standard model of particle physics that could help explain the existence of the Higgs boson at the electroweak scale and also provide a better understanding of dark matter. The Higgs boson is the first elementary particle to be discovered that has no intrinsic angular momentum. As such its mass is susceptible to divergent quantum corrections.  A basic symmetry between bosons and fermions called Supersymmetry provides counter-terms to stabilize the Higgs mass at the electroweak scale. A by-product of this symmetry, when it is combined with a new conserved parity, is the existence of a new particle that is an excellent candidate for dark matter. Incandela is searching for heavy partners to the top quark, as predicted by Supersymmetry, that would stabilize the Higgs at low mass, and which decay to dark matter particles.

An Africanist, she has done intensive field research in Senegal, mainly in a rural Wolof community, focusing mainly on linguistic practice and social hierarchy. She has also done research on languages spoken in other parts of the African continent, with an emphasis on honorific constructions and the performance of deference, recently in collaborative work in South Africa on Zulu. An ongoing project focuses on the history of Africanist linguistics and anthropology, especially during the early colonial era. Another major current project concerns ideologies of language and the making \u2013 and sometimes erasing \u2013 of social difference.

VMy work is macroevolutionary: the origin and fate of evolutionary novelties and lineages. I have focused on marine invertebrates, particularly mollusks, which have a rich fossil record and are extensively sampled in modern oceans. I?ve developed empirical approaches to multilevel selection, with species-level traits such as geographic range not only influencing origination and extinction rates but showing significant among-species heritability. However, I found many of the factors conferring extinction-resistance during "normal" times to be ineffective during mass extinctions, explaining the disproportionate evolutionary impact of those rare events. The evolutionary aftermaths of mass extinctions are also important, and my work on recoveries from extinction events aims to understand why some survivors fail to diversify, and the factors that set up regional differences in post-extinction dynamics, which demonstrably have long-term consequences. Evolutionary origins also show unexpected spatial patterns, tending to arise in onshore, tropical settings, even when extant descendants are restricted to the deep sea. Recently my research group has been analyzing the dynamics of the latitudinal diversity gradient, finding that the tropics are both a cradle and a museum of biological diversity, with lineage expansion out of the tropics, apparently via speciation, being a major determinant of marine diversity patterns.My work is macroevolutionary: the origin and fate of evolutionary novelties and lineages.

VMy laboratory uses genetic and genomic techniques to study epigenetic gene silencing in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the initiation of DNA methylation requires the DNA methyltransferase DRM2, a homolog of mammalian Dnmt3, which is guided by 24 nucleotide small RNAs and several RNA silencing proteins including Pol IV, RDR2, DCL3, Pol V, and AGO4. The mechanisms involved in the maintenance of preexisting DNA methylation are different for methylation in the three different sequence contexts, CG, CHG and CHH. CG methylation is coupled with DNA replication and requires the DNA methyltransferase MET1, a homolog of mammalian Dnmt1, and the accessory factor VIM1, a homolog of mammalian UHRF1. CHG methylation is inherited by a positive feedback loop between histone H3K9 methylation and CHG DNA methylation, because the H3K9 methyltransferase KRYPTONITE binds directly to CHG methylated DNA, and the CHG DNA methyltransferase CMT3 binds directly to methylated histone H3 tails. CHH methylation is maintained by continual targeting of DRM2 and small RNAs to particular loci. Other work suggest that DNA methylation not only serves as a mark of gene silencing, but also acts to regulate the DNA replication of transposable elements.My laboratory uses genetic and genomic techniques to study epigenetic gene silencing in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

To this end, they mainly use structural biochemistry (including crystallography) and artificial membranes to isolate and characterize partial reactions involved in the fusion pathway. Their work was instrumental in developing the zippering hypothesis for SNARE function, which is presently widely accepted. Furthermore, the lab made essential contributions to our understanding of the calcium sensor synaptotagmin that triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles in response to stimulation. Moreover, the laboratory developed the first quantitative molecular model of a trafficking organelle, and it clarified how synaptic vesicles can be filled with neurotransmitters within seconds after being endocytosed after use.Reinhard Jahn's laboratory is interested in the molecular mechanisms of neuronal exocyotosis, with particular emphasis on the conformational transitions during SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and their regulation by accessory proteins such as synaptotagmin, Munc18 and Munc13.

V1. Molecular Biology of Transcription Circuit Evolution. The gradual rewiring of transcriptional circuits over evolutionary timescales is a major source of the diversity of life. We study the molecular mechanisms that underlie these rewiring events and how these changes in circuitry lead to differences among species. We carry out this work in a large group of unicellular eukaryotes (the fungi) including the "model" eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. 2. Candida albicans pathogenesis. C. albicans is a species of fungus that typically resides asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other warm-blooded animals. It is also the most prevalent human fungal pathogen, causing a variety of skin and soft tissue infections in healthy people and more virulent and invasive and disseminated diseases in immunocompromised humans. We study how C. albicans forms biofilms, how it interacts with host cells and members of the human microflora, and how its transcription circuits and RNA splicing patterns have been adapted for life in a mammalian host.1.

My colleagues and I then undertook a systematic study of the mechanisms of memory distortion, including empirical investigations of reality monitoring\u2014exploring how the memory representations of perception and thought (inferences, imaginations) are alike and how they are different, how they are discriminated, and why they are sometimes confused. We have suggested that the phenomena of both true and false memories can be understood within a more general framework that addresses how the features of experience become bound into complex representations and how activated information is later attributed to specific sources during remembering (the source monitoring framework). We have proposed that the mechanisms that underlie these processes consist of component perceptual and reflective processes (the MEM framework) that constitute cognition. We have also investigated changes in cognitive processes associated with aging and the relation between cognition and emotion.My laboratory studies human memory and cognition more broadly.

VMark Johnson\u2019s laboratory specializes in understanding chemical processes that occur in condensed phases by extracting key species directly from solution, freezing them into well defined geometries and characterizing the potential energy surfaces that govern reactions through precision spectroscopic measurements. This requires design and construction of new types of instrumentation that draw inspiration equally from analytical chemistry and atomic physics. From this effort has evolved a powerful new class of spectrometers that effectively bring an FTIR-like capability to mass spectrometry. With it, he can structurally analyze the wide range of species accessible through atmospheric ionization techniques like electrospray ionization. In essence, he combines multi-dimensional laser spectroscopy with the extreme sensitivity of mass spectrometry to yield a qualitatively new way to follow chemical processes at the molecular level. These methods have provided microscopic pictures of how elementary species like protons and electrons are accommodated by water networks, as well as enable capture key reaction intermediates in both bio-inspired and organometallic catalysis. Although much of his work focuses on the properties of ions, he has also introduced variations that enable composition and size-selective measurements to be carried out on electrically neutral systems, with a notable application to homogeneous water clusters.Mark Johnson\u2019s laboratory specializes in understanding chemical processes that occur in condensed phases by extracting key species directly from solution, freezing them into well defined geometries and characterizing the potential energy surfaces that govern reactions through precision spectroscopic measurements.

VIn the early 90s, the Jones group used genetics to discover the first transmembrane cell surface receptors involved in immunity in plants, and discovered that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of such receptors is involved in pathogen recognition. He was first to propose the guard hypothesis for indirect recognition of pathogen molecules by plant immune receptors. Current Research in the Jones laboratory includes; The Arabidopsis RPS4 and RRS1 genes encode an intracellular immune receptor complex that is required for recognition of bacterial effectors AvrRps4 and PopP2 via their interactions with the RRS1 WRKY DNA-binding \u201cintegrated decoy\u201d domain. The Jones lab is investigating how recognition of effectors results in defense activation by the complex.  Pathogens have evolved effector proteins that interfere with host defense mechanisms. The Jones lab has helped define the Arabidopsis downy mildew effector complement and some host targets, and continues to investigate white rusts of Brassicaceae by defining Albugo genomes, their evolution, their effector repertoires, and host targets of their effectors.   The Jones lab is isolating novel Resistance to Phytophthora infestans (Rpi) genes from wild diploid potatoes. Rpi-vnt1 will be the such resistance gene deployed transgenically in commerce. To accelerate R gene cloning the Jones lab developed RenSeq, a method to define all the intracellular immune receptor sequences (the \u201cNLRome\u201d) of a plant of interest, to reveal receptor diversity and evolution.In the early 90s, the Jones group used genetics to discover the first transmembrane cell surface receptors involved in immunity in plants, and discovered that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of such receptors is involved in pathogen recognition.

To accelerate R gene cloning the Jones lab developed RenSeq, a method to define all the intracellular immune receptor sequences (the \u201cNLRome\u201d) of a plant of interest, to reveal receptor diversity and evolution.In the early 90s, the Jones group used genetics to discover the first transmembrane cell surface receptors involved in immunity in plants, and discovered that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of such receptors is involved in pathogen recognition. He was first to propose the guard hypothesis for indirect recognition of pathogen molecules by plant immune receptors. Current Research in the Jones laboratory includes; The Arabidopsis RPS4 and RRS1 genes encode an intracellular immune receptor complex that is required for recognition of bacterial effectors AvrRps4 and PopP2 via their interactions with the RRS1 WRKY DNA-binding \u201cintegrated decoy\u201d domain.

VBill's research interests are broad including organic, physical, and biochemistry. He has been a pioneer of computational studies of organic and biomolecular systems in solution. This has included development and application of (1) the widely used OPLS force fields including the TIPnP models for water, (2) free-energy methods for organic reactions, host-guest binding and other equilibria, (3) mixed quantum and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations for organic and enzymatic reactions in solution, and (4) methods for computer-aided molecular design, especially for enzyme inhibitors. His development of the OPLS force fields and TIPnP water models facilitated widespread modeling of biomolecular systems in aqueous solution starting in the 1980s. His prolific development of molecular modeling software (BOSS, MCPRO, BOMB) has been essential to the technical advances. Bill's research on protein-ligand binding has evolved to de novo drug design and synthesis, particularly for anti-infective, anti-proliferative, and anti-inflammatory agents. His computer-guided methods have led to the rational design and discovery of extraordinarily potent anti-HIV agents, an antibacterial agent that has completed phase-II clinical trials, and a first-in-class anti-inflammatory agent that is in late preclinical development.Bill's research interests are broad including organic, physical, and biochemistry.

In addition to basic mechanisms of gene silencing, she has been studying the regulation of the miRNA let-7, important in embryonic development and differentiation. She is also known for her studies of E1, a key factor in the replication of papillomavirus, a virus that causes cervical cancer. Dr. Joshua-Tor discovered how E1 moves along DNA, which has had implications for molecular motors in many fields of biology. More recently, she has been examining the eukaryotic DNA replication machinery with the human Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) as the centerpiece of these studies.Leemor Joshua-Tor\u2019s laboratory studies the molecular basis of nucleic acid regulatory processes, in particular RNA interference (RNAi) and DNA replication.

VJean Jouzel started ice core research in the early 1970's in collaboration with Claude Lorius and his group in Grenoble. After participating in the first Dome C project, he became fully involved in the Vostok ice core program conducted in the frame of collaborations between French, Russian and US scientists. His name is also associated to the launching and success of the European Program for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA project that he chaired from 1994 to 2000). Two coring programs have been conducted allowing to extend the ice core timescale back to 800,000 years and helping to decipher the link between Northern and Southern hemisphere climate. Although more deeply involved and focused in Antarctic research, he has also been active in Greenland projects such as GRIP and North GRIP, and in the comparison of records from both poles. He has promoted the modeling of water isotopomers that, with NASA colleagues, he has implemented in the NASA/GISS atmospheric GCM in the 1980\u2019s. He has been at the origin of the launching of PMIP, a successful program intended to engage in intercomparison simulations of past climates, and has a strong interest in the links between past and future climate changes.Jean Jouzel started ice core research in the early 1970's in collaboration with Claude Lorius and his group in Grenoble.

VI am trained as a medical oncologist and molecular biologist. As a postdoctoral fellow I determined that tumor suppression by the retinoblastoma protein is due, at least partly, to its ability to bind to members of the E2F family of cell-cycle regulatory transcription factors and cloned the first member of the E2F family, E2F1. As an independent investigator I have focused primarily on the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), which is defective in the most common form of kidney cancer. We showed that pVHL is part of an ubiquitin ligase complex that, in the presence of oxygen, targets the HIF transcription factor for proteasomal degradation. Moreover, we showed that the binding of pVHL to HIF requires that HIF be prolyl hydroxylated by oxygen-dependent enzymes, thereby providing a mechanism by which cells sense and adapt to changes in oxygen. Our current focus is to identify additional pVHL functions, to identify genetic alterations that cooperate with pVHL loss to cause cancer, and to determine if other intracellular proteins are subject to hydroxylation. We are also using genetic and pharmacologic tools to determine if HIF stabilization would have salutary effects in the setting of anemia or ischemic diseases.I am trained as a medical oncologist and molecular biologist.

VMy lab investigates the cellular and molecular mechanisms for insulin resistance in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Our work established the critical role of the GLUT4 glucose transporter in adipocytes in regulating systemic insulin sensitivity, energy balance and inflammation. We showed that down-regulation of GLUT4 in adipocytes markedly increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes and GLUT4 overexpression in adipocytes enhances glucose tolerance. We use genomic, metabolomics and lipidomic approaches in human tissues and genetically-engineered mouse models to discover novel adipocyte-associated molecules. This has revealed important biomarkers and mechanisms for insulin resistance and diabetes. For example, we demonstrated that retinol-binding-protein-4 levels are elevated in insulin-resistant people and this causes insulin resistance by activating both innate and adaptive immune responses in adipose tissue. We also showed that de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes has a major role in regulating systemic insulin sensitivity. With Alan Saghatelian, we used global lipidomics to discover a novel class of lipids made in mammalian tissues, which correlate highly with insulin sensitivity in humans and have anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. We are investigating the receptors/signaling pathways by which these lipids enhance insulin secretion and insulin action, and determining the biosynthetic and degradative enzymes that regulate these lipids. A major goal is to discover new approaches to prevent and treat diabetes.My lab investigates the cellular and molecular mechanisms for insulin resistance in obesity and Type 2 diabetes.

Under Dr. Kahn\u2019s leadership at DARPA, two other packet network efforts were created \u2013 packet radio, which is a forerunner of today\u2019s CDMA type cellular networks, and SATNET, an Ethernet-like capability that used a single channel on Intelsat IV to link research networks in the United States and Europe.  He started the packet voice program at DARPA, which demonstrated and validated the use of packet networks to communicate real-time signals, which was a forerunner to today\u2019s VOIP technology in widespread use today for speech communication. In addition to networking, his current interests focus on evolving the Internet to enable information to be managed effectively on a global basis using unique identifiers, and to enable heterogeneous information systems to work together with a focus on security and persistence as well as interoperability.

VCharles Kane's research is focused on the quantum electronic properties of materials and electronic devices. Of interest is understanding the collective behavior of electrons in materials, which is important both for applications in electronics technology as well as for our understanding of the fundamental emergent behavior that matter can exhibit. Kane is known for his theoretical work characterizing Luttinger liquids, the quantum Hall effect and carbon nanotubes. His recent work has focused on topological electronic phases. He predicted the existence of a new class of materials known as topological insulators, which are electrical insulators on their interior but conduct electricity in a very special way on their surface. The special properties of these surface states identify a novel kind of topological order and could be useful for applications ranging from low power electronics to creating a topological quantum computer. The combination of the theoretical richness of topological insulators and related materials and their experimental availability, has initiated a new field in condensed matter physics. The key questions include: What are the possible fundamental electronic phases? How can they be realized in realistic materials or devices? and How can their properties be harnessed for practical applications?Charles Kane's research is focused on the quantum electronic properties of materials and electronic devices.

VKapitulnik\u2019s research activities focus on studies of quantum-mechanical dominated properties of materials, which exhibit unexpected 'emergent' phenomena because of their unique electronic structure that is dominated by strong correlations and topology. Of particular interest to his group are phenomena related to the occurrence of novel forms of superconductivity and magnetism, and the interplay between them resulting in quantum critical phenomena. For example, the study of the paradigmatic quantum phase transition between a two-dimensional superconductor and insulator, with possible intervening unconventional metallic states. Following the discovery of high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates, Kapitulnik\u2019s group engaged in a number of key experiments to better understand the nature of the electronic properties of these materials, with key contributions to the understanding of their vortex state and the nature of the electronic state just above where superconductivity sets in. Kapitulnik\u2019s group also specializes in the development of precision detection instrumentation. In particular they developed the Sagnac Interferometer for ultra-sensitive measurements of time-reversal symmetry breaking effects in solids, particularly unconventional superconductors. Using their technical expertise, they also developed novel, cantilever-based, instrumentation for testing the inverse-square-law of gravity at sub-mm distances.Kapitulnik\u2019s research activities focus on studies of quantum-mechanical dominated properties of materials, which exhibit unexpected 'emergent' phenomena because of their unique electronic structure that is dominated by strong correlations and topology.

VAs an ecologist, I have studied how species and ecosystem dynamics play out across complex landscapes. My initial interests focused on the role of dispersal in modulating dynamics and maintaining species in fragmented habitats. I used both mathematical models and field experiments to document the importance of dispersal in insect population dynamics. As my interests switched to conservation I studied the interplay of habitat degradation, hatchery fish, and dams in limiting salmon productivity. When my conservation research moved increasingly to developing nations, I realized that it was critical to model and quantify the value of ecosystem services. Now in collaboration with scientists around the world, I seek to identify the tradeoffs between major public investments in energy, mining, and food production and the sustainability of our ecosystems. Because I want the science I produce to influence resource extraction and economic development policies, I also study how people make decisions, and how we can better use our understanding of ecosystems to promote smarter solutions to the challenges of water and energy scarcity and food security.As an ecologist, I have studied how species and ecosystem dynamics play out across complex landscapes.

VWhat are the evolutionary origins of the cells and circuits of the vertebrate brain? My lab uses morphological histochemical, developmental and physiological tools to explore the organization of the avian visual and auditory pathways. Despite seeming differences between nonmammalia and mammals in the macroarchitecture of the brain, the essential circuitry of the forebrain is very highly conserved across all vertebrates. Current strategies rely heavily on wide field imaging at mesoscopic magnification (0.5 micrometers/pixel), and methods for sharing "big data" over the internet. I am involved in developing large datasets of avian and mammalian brains, and designing suitable software for utilizing and sharing this information.What are the evolutionary origins of the cells and circuits of the vertebrate brain?

VDamage to cellular DNA contributes to cancer development and is a mechanism by which many cancer therapeutics work. My laboratory has focused on understanding the mechanisms by which cells recognize and repair damage to their DNA and on the cellular signaling pathways that determine the cellular and organismal outcomes after DNA damage. We made the seminal observation that the tumor suppressor gene product, p53, is a central mediator of cellular responses to DNA damage and a major determinant of cell viability after DNA damage and other stresses. We subsequently demonstrated that DNA damage activates the ATM protein kinase and initiates a complex signal transduction pathway that includes the induction and phosphorylation of p53 protein. This signaling pathway is now called the \u201cDDR\u201d or DNA Damage Response pathway. Several participants in this signaling pathway have turned out to be important determinants of cancer susceptibility and we, and others, are now targeting some of these molecules to improve outcomes after cancer therapy. Interestingly, several of these molecules are also turning out to have functional roles outside of DDR signaling, such as in regulation of metabolic signaling, thus almost certainly impacting on physiological processes in addition to cancer.Damage to cellular DNA contributes to cancer development and is a mechanism by which many cancer therapeutics work.

VBeginning with a chance encounter with a patient with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), I have spent my research career studying the genetic basis, pathophysiology, and targeted therapy of inherited disorders of inflammation. Using classical linkage analysis, my laboratory mapped the gene for FMF to chromosome 16p and subsequently identified the recessively inherited gene by positional cloning. This gene encodes what was then a novel protein (pyrin) that is the prototype for a motif found in 20 human proteins, several involved in inflammation. Prompted by an Irish patient with an FMF-like illness, we discovered that mutations in the p55 TNF receptor cause a dominantly inherited fever syndrome that we named TRAPS (the TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome). Stimulated by other patients, we found that mutations in a pyrin domain-containing activator of interleukin-1 (IL-1) cause a devastating inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system, skin, and bones known as NOMID, that dominant mutations in a pyrin-binding protein cause a distinct syndrome of severe arthritis and skin disease, while recessive mutations in the endogenous IL-1 receptor antagonist cause a newly recognized disorder of pustulosis and osteitis. These latter three illnesses help define the role of IL-1 in human biology, and all three are clinically responsive to IL-1 inhibition. More recently we have used genome-wide association to discover that variants in the genes encoding IL-10 and the IL-23 receptor, both potential therapeutic targets, confer susceptibility to Behçet's disease. We also proposed the now widely accepted concept of autoinflammatory disease to denote disorders of innate immunity.Beginning with a chance encounter with a patient with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), I have spent my research career studying the genetic basis, pathophysiology, and targeted therapy of inherited disorders of inflammation.

VI am interested in various aspects of influenza virus infection. I have demonstrated that modification of the cleavage site sequence of the hemagglutinin protein alone could attenuate highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses without affecting viral antigenicity. In addition, my team was the first to establish a reverse genetics technology that allows us to generate influenza viruses sorely from cloned cDNA. This technology has led to fundamental discoveries in the field and is used by WHO laboratories to develop human vaccines containing attenuated H5N1 avian virus strains and by government agencies throughout the world to rapidly identify lethal avian influenza viruses. In addition, I have identified the molecular mechanisms by which avian influenza viruses cross host species barriers and infect humans. In parts of the world where H5N1 human infections persist, identification of these markers is essential to surveillance programs and control strategies. Our current research projects include: identification of viral and host factors involved in viral replication, pathogenicity, interspecies transmission, and transmissibility; understanding antigenic evolution of influenza viruses; and development of novel vaccines and antiviral compounds.I am interested in various aspects of influenza virus infection.

VKenneth Keegstra has studied several different research problems, but has focused most of his activities on studying the biogenesis of chloroplasts in higher plants and on investigating the structure and biosynthesis of plant cell wall polysaccharides. His laboratory spent many years studying the process by which proteins are transported from their site of synthesis within the cytosol into chloroplasts and subsequently directed to their proper location within the organelle. In recent years, most of his attention has focused on the biosynthesis of plant cell wall polysaccharides. His laboratory has focused on the identification and characterization of the genes and proteins responsible for the biosynthesis of xyloglucans and mannans; both significant components of plant cell walls. His interest in plant cell wall polysaccharides has led to his involvement in the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, where the goal is to develop technology for converting plant cell wall components into liquid transportation fuels.Kenneth Keegstra has studied several different research problems, but has focused most of his activities on studying the biogenesis of chloroplasts in higher plants and on investigating the structure and biosynthesis of plant cell wall polysaccharides.

VKenig (with his collaborators, postdocs and students) have been interested in obtaining optimal estimates for solutions of elliptic boundary value problems under minimal regularity assumptions. They have been interested in free boundary problems. For example: how do regularity properties of harmonic measure give geometric information on the boundary? They have been interested in qualitative and quantitative uniqueness properties of solutions of partial differential equations (unique continuation) in connection with mathematical physics, control theory and spectral geometry. They have also been interested in inverse problems. Here one knows the solutions of a partial differential equation on a subset of the boundary, and one seeks to determine the equation. (Such problems arise in geophysical prospection and medical imaging). For the last 25 years, they have been studying non-linear dispersive equations (which model various wave propagation phenomena). The initial emphasis was on the development of a satisfactory well-posedness theory. This was achieved through a systematic use of the methods of modern harmonic analysis. Subsequently interest shifted to the study of the long-time behavior of large solutions. Issues like blow-up, scattering and soliton resolution have come to the forefront and are currently vigorously researched.Kenig (with his collaborators, postdocs and students) have been interested in obtaining optimal estimates for solutions of elliptic boundary value problems under minimal regularity assumptions.

VV. Narry Kim\u2019s laboratory has been interested in RNA-mediated gene regulation. In particular, the Kim lab studies the biogenesis pathway of microRNA. They identified several key factors, including Drosha and terminal nucleotidyl transferases, and uncovered their action mechanisms. microRNA biogenesis begins with RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription which leads to production of long primary transcript or pri-miRNA. Pri-miRNA is processed by two RNase III type enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, consecutively. dsRNA binding proteins and terminal nucleotidyl transferases modulate microRNA processing and decay. The Kim lab has also been investigating microRNA-mediated gene control in stem cells, by discovering stem cell specific microRNAs, uncovering the role of LIN28 in microRNA control, and analyzing RNA-binding proteome in embryonic stem cells. The lab\u2019s interest also lies in RNA modification, particularly tailing of microRNA and mRNA. They developed a technique that allows genome-wide analyses of mRNA tail, and found that mRNA uridylation is important for mRNA turnover.V.

A second takes on transformation in racial politics in the United States since World War II.

VI develop and apply statistical and other empirical methods in a variety of areas of social science research, focusing on innovations that span the range from abstract statistical theory to practical application. I have developed methods to infer individual-level behavior from group-level data (e.g., used to determine whether the Voting Rights Act applies), methods for forecasting cause-specific mortality rates using more information than has previously been possible (e.g., for directing international public health dollars and evaluating the viability of the insurance schemes and Social Security), and methods of automated analysis of unstructured text (e.g., used to understand social media posts, customer emails, political speeches, and analyst reports). I have also developed the standards and methods used to evaluate whether legislative redistricting plans are fair to one political party to another; methods of survey research that correct for cross-cultural or interpersonal incomparability; and approaches to large scale experimental design for the evaluation of public policy programs that are are more efficient and robust to political and other interventions. For observational data, I have contributed widely-used methods for missing data, measurement error, causal inference, rare events, and data sharing.I develop and apply statistical and other empirical methods in a variety of areas of social science research, focusing on innovations that span the range from abstract statistical theory to practical application.

I have developed methods to infer individual-level behavior from group-level data (e.g., used to determine whether the Voting Rights Act applies), methods for forecasting cause-specific mortality rates using more information than has previously been possible (e.g., for directing international public health dollars and evaluating the viability of the insurance schemes and Social Security), and methods of automated analysis of unstructured text (e.g., used to understand social media posts, customer emails, political speeches, and analyst reports).

VI study the molecular basis of development and evolution in vertebrates. Using genetic approaches in laboratory mice, we have identified key pathways that control the formation and maintenance of bones and joints in the vertebrate skeleton. By applying similar genetic approaches to natural populations of threespine stickleback fish, we have also been able to map and identify the key genes and mutations that underlie dramatic evolutionary changes in naturally occurring species. These studies show that evolution is surprisingly predictable, with particular genomic mechanisms used over and over again when similar traits evolve in different populations and independent locations. We are currently applying lessons from mice and sticklebacks to the study of evolutionary change in other species, including humans. We are still a long way from knowing the particular DNA changes that have made us human. However, we believe that the molecular mechanisms contributing to human-specific traits can now be studied, and that progress in this area will lead to important new insights into human health and human disease.I study the molecular basis of development and evolution in vertebrates.

VRobert Kingston\u2019s laboratory is focused on understanding how the nucleosome is involved in regulatory processes, especially those that occur during development. The nucleosome is a fundamental component of the packaging of chromatin. It has been co-opted to play a key direct role in regulation via the creation of accessible and inaccessible parts of the genome. Kingston\u2019s group studies the function of proteins encoded by the genetically defined Polycomb-Group (PcG) and trithorax-Group (trxG) families, two gene families that are necessary for maintenance of gene expression patterns during development. They characterize complexes formed by mammalian and fly proteins encoded by the PcG genes and determine how those complexes maintain repression of genes during development. They do similar work on trxG proteins and their role in activation of gene expression. Biochemical, structural, cell culture and genetic studies are used to determine how the nucleosome is held in place by compaction or is made accessible via ATP-dependent remodeling. This work examines what characteristics of the nucleosomes change when they are part of a regulated region and how targeting to those regions occurs. It also encompasses structural studies to determine the precise nature of contacts that are made between the complexes and the nucleosome as well as genetic studies to examine the impact of precise mutations in PcG and trxG genes on development.Robert Kingston\u2019s laboratory is focused on understanding how the nucleosome is involved in regulatory processes, especially those that occur during development.

VDr. Kinzler's laboratory has focused on the genetics of human cancer with a particular emphasis on exploring how inherited and somatic mutations can improve the clinical management of cancer. Dr. Kinzler and his collaborators have identified over a dozen cancer driver genes (e.g., APC, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, IDH1/2, ARID1A, ATRX/DAXX and CIC) and the hereditary basis of several cancer predisposition syndromes (e.g., Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and Hereditary Non-polyposis Colorectal Cancer). They have also developed several novel technologies to facilitate their studies of cancer. In particular they have focused on the development to digital genomic methods (e.g., Digital PCR, BEAMing and Safe-SeqS) for detecting trace levels of tumor DNA. Most recently, they have focused on using these digital approaches to demonstrate the power of cancer-specific somatic mutations as clinical biomarkers for early cancer detection and the management of cancer patients.Dr. Kinzler's laboratory has focused on the genetics of human cancer with a particular emphasis on exploring how inherited and somatic mutations can improve the clinical management of cancer.

He is particularly known for studies indentifying several major cancer driver genes including the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene which initiates the majority of colorectal tumors. His subsequent analyses of the functional properties of the APC gene product has had widespread ramifications for developmental biology as well as cancer biology. He is also known for the development of genetic methods for analyzing gene expression and mutations in human cancer. He invented digital PCR and other digital genomics approaches for the detection of trace levels of tumor DNA. These inventions helped pioneer the use of somatic mutations as cancer biomarkers and the concept of liquid biopsies for cancer. Dr. Kinzler was born and raised in Philadelphia, PA. He graduated from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science (now the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia) in 1983 with a BS in Toxicology and from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1988 with a Ph.D. in Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences.

The design problems for such systems combine computational issues with large-scale human social interaction, and they involve a novel mix of algorithmic questions, the analysis of social feedback effects, and the balancing of incentives to guide behavior. Moreover, with an increasing amount of social interaction taking place in the digital domain, and often in public on-line settings, we are accumulating enormous amounts of data about phenomena that were once essentially invisible to us: the collective behavior and social interactions of a large fraction of the world's population, recorded at unprecedented levels of scale and resolution.

VSteven Kliewer\u2019s laboratory, which he runs jointly with David Mangelsdorf, has a longstanding interest in nuclear receptors and hormone action, especially as they relate to metabolism. Their ongoing research revolves around two broad projects. First, they study the physiology and pharmacology of two atypical fibroblast growth factors, FGF15/19 and FGF21, which act as hormones. They have shown that FGF15/19 and FGF21 regulate metabolism and related processes in response to feeding and fasting, respectively. They have further shown that pharmacologically, FGF15/19 and FGF21 cause weight loss and improve insulin action in obese animals by acting on the brain. They are currently elucidating the molecular pathways through which FGF15/19 and FGF21 exert their physiologic and pharmacologic effects. In a second project, they are studying the nuclear hormone receptor DAF12, which is present in roundworms and parasitic nematodes, where it regulates metabolism and the reproductive cycle. The laboratory is investigating whether drugs that target DAF12 can be used as vermicides against parasites that infect humans, livestock and plants.Steven Kliewer\u2019s laboratory, which he runs jointly with David Mangelsdorf, has a longstanding interest in nuclear receptors and hormone action, especially as they relate to metabolism. Their ongoing research revolves around two broad projects. First, they study the physiology and pharmacology of two atypical fibroblast growth factors, FGF15/19 and FGF21, which act as hormones. They have shown that FGF15/19 and FGF21 regulate metabolism and related processes in response to feeding and fasting, respectively. They have further shown that pharmacologically, FGF15/19 and FGF21 cause weight loss and improve insulin action in obese animals by acting on the brain.

VDr. Kling\u2019s research interests in environmental economics relate to the theory and practice of valuing environmental goods and the design of environmental policy. Her theoretical research in nonmarket valuation has characterized what can be learned about consumer preferences for public goods from their footprints in the marketplace, has developed dynamic welfare measures that extend traditional measures to include uncertainty and learning over time, and has contributed to understanding anomalies in micro theory such as the disparity between willingness to pay and accept. Her empirical methodological interests include the refinement of random utility maximization and discrete choice models and their application using primary data collected via survey instruments. Her work in the design of environmental policy includes theoretical work to understand the consequences of intertemporal emission trading for environmental damages. Kling has built an interdisciplinary research group to develop integrated land use and water quality models to provide policy guidance on the design and implementation of environmental policies in agriculture. By combining an integrated assessment model with an evolutionary algorithm, the team has assessed assess cost-effective policies to reduce nutrient loadings in local waters and to alleviate the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico.Dr. Kling\u2019s research interests in environmental economics relate to the theory and practice of valuing environmental goods and the design of environmental policy.

VNancy Knowlton has devoted her research career to understanding the diversity of life in the ocean, particularly on coral reefs.  Her work has spanned the fields of behavior, ecology, conservation, systematics, and evolution, studying organisms as diverse as microbes, corals and crustaceans. Work on the responses of reefs to major disturbances illustrated that such ecosystems might have alternative stable states, a finding of significance to reef conservation.  The tools of molecular genetics have been regularly employed in her laboratory to distinguish and compare organisms that are difficult to characterize using traditional methods.  These approaches have led to the realization that many so-called species are actually large complexes of cryptic species that are reproductively isolated.  Work showing that the microscopic algae living in coral tissue differ in their sensitivity to temperature has had important implications for predicting the response of coral reefs to global warming. Her studies of coral evolutionary relationships showed that the majority of traditional families needed to be revised and redefined.  Most recently, she has pioneered the use of DNA bar-coding and next-generation sequencing, coupled with standardized sampling protocols, to determine how many species live on coral reefs.Nancy Knowlton has devoted her research career to understanding the diversity of life in the ocean, particularly on coral reefs.  Her work has spanned the fields of behavior, ecology, conservation, systematics, and evolution, studying organisms as diverse as microbes, corals and crustaceans.

VThe goal of research in my lab is to characterize the structure and mechanism of activation of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). As a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Lefkowitz, I contributed to the cloning of six different GPCRs including B2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR). Since establishing my lab at Stanford University in 1990, I have employed a variety of approaches including cell biology, gene disruption in mice, and in vivo physiology to determine the role of specific adrenergic receptor subtypes in normal physiology. During the past 15 years my lab has applied a spectrum of biochemical and biophysical tools to study different aspects of GPCR structure and activation. In 2007 we obtained the first high-resolution crystal structures of the B2AR. The method that we developed to obtain crystals of the B2AR (generating T4 lysozyme fusion proteins) has subsequently been used to crystallize several other GPCRs. More recently we obtained crystal structures of agonist-bound B2AR in both inactive and active states, as well as a crystal structure of the B2AR-Gs complex. These crystallography studies provided the first high-resolution snap-shots of transmembrane signaling by a G protein coupled receptor.The goal of research in my lab is to characterize the structure and mechanism of activation of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).

VRhizobium-legume symbiosis was always in the focus of my research interest. First by its importance in the combined nitrogen-pool of the Earth through nitrogen fixation but mostly because of the exciting molecular communication and elaborated developmental programs of the bacterium and the plant partner. My research started with the identification of the Rhizobium nodulation genes whose products; the Nod factors induce root nodule formation in the host plant. Then I studied how Nod factors activate cell cycle in the differentiated plant cells and the mechanism of meristem formation and cell differentiation. We have identified the cell cycle switch CCS52 proteins that play roles in meristem maintenance, cell cycle exit and genome doublings and showed that growth and polyploidy of symbiotic cells by CCS52A is essential for nodule differentiation. Our recent studies discovered a remarkable, plant controlled differentiation process of the bacterium partner resulting in living, non-dividing, polyploid, elongated and branched nitrogen fixing bacteria. We have shown that the bacterium differentiation plant factors are nodule-specific peptides resembling antimicrobial peptides of the innate immunity that interact with the bacterial cell envelope and enter the cytosol. Our current studies aim at the identification of the bacterial targets and the mode of action of the plant peptides both in and beyond symbiosis.Rhizobium-legume symbiosis was always in the focus of my research interest.

This research involves mathematical modeling of the evolution of genomes, pathways and networks; theory and practice of genome-wide phylogenetic analysis; construction of evolutionary scenarios for genomes and individual functional systems; evolutionary classification of proteins and RNA; identification of previously undetected protein domains and prediction of their functions. Koonin is particularly interested in evolution of viruses and virus-host coevolution including diversity and evolution of antivirus defense systems. This research involves extensive use of metagenomics sequences, in a focused effort to discover new defense systems and viruses. An important direction in the group is the characterization of novel variants of CRISPR-Cas systems, aiming at reconstruction of the evolution of adaptive immunity in prokaryotes as well as identification of potential new tools for genome engineering. Much of Koonin\u2019s research involves direct collaboration with experimental laboratories on testing functional predictions made by computational approaches.

VJános Kornai has become well-known as a researcher of the socialist system and post-socialist transition. He was born in Hungary and completed his studies there. He received his \u201ccandidate of science\u201d degree (an approximate equivalent of the PhD) from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 1956 for his Overcentralization of Economic Administration. It was published in Hungarian and later in English, the translation being based on a manuscript smuggled out of Hungary. This was the first book where an economist east of the Iron Curtain critically analyzed the foundations of the socialist system. His most well-known, the Economics of Shortage, describes the dysfunctional characteristics of the socialist system, pointing out that the chronic shortage of goods and services cannot be eliminated through reforms. His book The Socialist System provides a general overview of the communist system. In his later works he has focused on the transition between the socialist to the capitalist system. János Kornai has been president of the Econometric Society, the European Economic Association and the International Economic Association. He is a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and is an associate or foreign member of the National Academy of Sciences and several other academies worldwide.János Kornai has become well-known as a researcher of the socialist system and post-socialist transition.

VAs a molecular biologist, I have studied the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, the mechanism that explains how every single human gene generates multiple proteins. My lab proved that promoters affect alternative splicing, a finding that changed the classical view of splicing as a transcription-independent process, indicating, on the contrary, that splicing and transcription are functionally coupled. We demonstrated that the coupling occurs through two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: the control of transcriptional elongation speed (kinetic coupling), and the association of splicing factors to RNA polymerase II (recruitment coupling), the enzyme in charge of transcribing the genes. We also found that DNA damage caused by UV irradiation affects alternative splicing by causing a reduction in RNA polymerase II elongation, confirming the physiological importance of the coupling. My lab also discovered that changes in chromatin structure and histone post-translational modifications modulate alternative splicing, and that small noncoding RNAs can regulate alternative splicing by affecting chromatin structure, which contributed to the rising field of the relationship between epigenetics and splicing.As a molecular biologist, I have studied the regulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, the mechanism that explains how every single human gene generates multiple proteins.

VMy laboratory uses genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches in budding yeast to understand genome integrity, genome evolution and most recently desiccation tolerance. The maintenance of genome integrity during cell division impacts cell viability, speciation, birth defects and human disease. The maintenance of genome integrity (chromosome number and integrity) requires different types of higher order chromosome organization. The molecular basis for the formation, maintenance and disassembly of higher order chromosome organization are major unsolved problems in cell biology. While processes like higher order chromsome organization, DNA replication and DNA repair are known to be critical for genome integrity, genome integrity is likely to require other yet to be describe processes. For example the cause of the gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCR) such as translocations, internal deletions or terminal truncations, prevalent in the vast majority of tumor cells is unknown. Finally, understanding desiccation tolerance has significant biomedical potential and will likely provide novel insights into the role of different cell biological processes in water homeostasis. While the molecular basis of desiccation tolerance has been correlated with many factors and phenomena, none of these proteins or processes have been shown to have a causative role.My laboratory uses genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches in budding yeast to understand genome integrity, genome evolution and most recently desiccation tolerance.

VRobb Krumlauf\u2019s research is interested in the gene regulatory information, transcriptional mechanisms and cellular processes which guide the formation and elaboration of the basic vertebrate body plan. They have investigated head development and Hox genes as models for understanding the integration of patterning mechanisms and regulatory networks governing hindbrain and craniofacial development. They revealed that formation of regional diversity in the hindbrain is achieved through a process of segmentation and the Hox family of transcription factors is coupled to this process. This provides a molecular framework for specifying the unique identities of hindbrain segments and facial structures. By dissecting regulatory circuits they have developed a mechanistic understanding of the cis-regulatory components of Hox clusters, their cognate upstream factors and the signaling inputs which govern the highly conserved expression and function of Hox genes in hindbrain development. Genomic approaches have identified downstream Hox target genes and linked these loci to the pathways and cellular processes they modulate in organogenesis and morphogenesis. Through comparative studies between different species they have built a detailed picture the regulatory cascades that control early head and facial patterning in development, disease and evolution.Robb Krumlauf\u2019s research is interested in the gene regulatory information, transcriptional mechanisms and cellular processes which guide the formation and elaboration of the basic vertebrate body plan. They have investigated head development and Hox genes as models for understanding the integration of patterning mechanisms and regulatory networks governing hindbrain and craniofacial development. They revealed that formation of regional diversity in the hindbrain is achieved through a process of segmentation and the Hox family of transcription factors is coupled to this process. This provides a molecular framework for specifying the unique identities of hindbrain segments and facial structures. By dissecting regulatory circuits they have developed a mechanistic understanding of the cis-regulatory components of Hox clusters, their cognate upstream factors and the signaling inputs which govern the highly conserved expression and function of Hox genes in hindbrain development.

VRobb Krumlauf is a developmental biologist known for demonstrating how the Hox family of transcription factors controls patterning of the hindbrain, head and body plan in development, disease and evolution. His seminal work discovered colinearity, whereby mammalian Hox homeobox genes are clustered next to one another and the order of genes on the chromosome matches the order of their expression and function in the embryo. Krumlauf was born in Ohio and grew up on New York. He received a degree in chemical engineering from Vanderbilt University in 1970 and a PhD in developmental biology from The Ohio State University in 1979. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research and the Fox Chase Cancer Center. In 1985 he joined the faculty of the National Institute for Medical Research UK (now Francis Crick Institute). In 2000 he became the founding Scientific Director of the Stowers Institute and holds faculty appointments at the University of Missouri at Kansas City and the University of Kansas Medical Center. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Academy of Medical Science (UK), and served as Editor-in-Chief of Developmental Biology and President of the Society for Developmental Biology.Robb Krumlauf is a developmental biologist known for demonstrating how the Hox family of transcription factors controls patterning of the hindbrain, head and body plan in development, disease and evolution.

VAs a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and ontology of humans' capacity for language, I study language development in human infants from the earliest moments of life. Using cross-cultural behavioral and brain methods, my work aims to describe the initial state and how language experience alters the infant brain and infants' language skills. To do this work, I target a model system within language that utilizes its most elementary components--the phonetic units of speech--a system that epitomizes the effects of the "critical period" on language learning. Speech experiments from infancy to adulthood indicate that infants discern differences among virtually all the phonetic units used in the world's languages. Language experience severely narrows this skill. A transition from a universal mode of perception to one that is language specific takes place in the first year of life, and the efficiency of this early phonetic learning predicts children's language abilities to 5 years of age. More recently, I have been exploring infants' language learning using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Employing MEG, my laboratory is examining brain oscillations that index changes in the perceptual strategy used by infants versus adults during learning. Our results may help explain the "critical period" for language.As a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and ontology of humans' capacity for language, I study language development in human infants from the earliest moments of life.

VI study the molecular basis of sensations. We pioneered the study of ion channels of E. coli, yeast, and Paramecium, instead of animals, to take advantage of the genetics of these model microbes. Patch clamp revealed mechanosensitive ion channels in E. coli. MscL was cloned, mutated, and later crystalized by the Rees lab. It is now the key biophysical model of molecular mechanosensitivity. A key lesson is that the force that opens these channels comes from the lipid bilayer, as incontrovertibly demonstrated by reconstituting purified MscL into bilayers of defined lipids. This concept is being extended to eukaryotic channels.I study the molecular basis of sensations.

VKuroda and her laboratory have utilized dosage compensation in Drosophila as a model for understanding how genomes are organized into chromatin. Her lab identified the MSL ribonucleoprotein complex, and discovered that it assembles and spreads from sites of non-coding roX RNA synthesis to regulate genes specifically on the fruitfly male X chromosome.  Furthermore, they dissected the sex-specific regulation of this process, and the molecular mechanism by which the MSL complex influences transcriptional elongation.  Recently, Kuroda has expanded her studies of chromatin through biochemical and genomic analyses of additional epigenetic regulators, such as the Polycomb group in fruitflies and in human cells.  One approach is to use cross-linking followed by mass spectrometry to identify the components of epigenetic complexes within their chromatin context.  Long-term interests include deciphering the role of aberrant chromatin organization in specific cancer models.Kuroda and her laboratory have utilized dosage compensation in Drosophila as a model for understanding how genomes are organized into chromatin.

VNatural killer (NK) cells are a type of white blood cell that provides protection against microbial pathogens and tumors.  Since the early 1980's, our lab has investigated how NK cells distinguish between normal healthy cells and cells that are transformed or infected with viruses.  NK cells express a diverse array of inhibitory and activating receptors on their cells surface that bind to ligands expressed on the cell surface of potential target cells.  When encountering healthy cells, signals transmitted by inhibitory NK receptors dominate and prevent autoimmunity, whereas the loss of ligands for the inhibitory receptors or the upregulation of ligands for the activating NK receptors on infected or transformed cells allows NK cells to kill these abnormal cells and secrete cytokine that influence the subsequent response by T cells and B cells.  We have developed mouse models systems in which key signaling molecules such as DAP10 and DAP12 have been ablated to explore the physiological role of these NK receptors in resistance to viral infections (cytomegalovirus, poxviruses, and influenza) and primary tumorigenesis.Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of white blood cell that provides protection against microbial pathogens and tumors.

VAntonio Lanzavecchia\u2019s laboratory investigates the mechanisms of antibody-mediated resistance to infectious diseases. Using high-throughput cellular screens, they interrogate with high efficiency the repertoires of human memory B cells and plasma cells and isolate potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies against a variety of targets, ranging from common pathogens such as influenza, CMV and RSV, to emerging viruses such as SARS, MERS, Ebola and Zika. These antibodies are characterized as candidates for prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases and are used as tools to identify and produce optimal vaccine components in a process of antibody-guided vaccine design. Besides these translational studies, the laboratory addresses fundamental aspects of the antibody response, such as the role of somatic mutations in affinity maturation and in the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies, as well as the relationship between infection and autoimmunity. The laboratory is also studying a new mechanism of antibody diversification through DNA transposition that was recently discovered in the context of the antibody response to malaria parasites.Antonio Lanzavecchia\u2019s laboratory investigates the mechanisms of antibody-mediated resistance to infectious diseases.

VMy field and laboratory research investigates the human impacts of major changes in diet, especially involving the adoption of and increased focus on the production and consumption of domesticated plants, a complex process taking place in the last 10,000 years of human evolution. Human remains from archaeological contexts provide the only direct source for documenting and interpreting changes in diet, health, and quality of life associated with the shift from a lifeway based exclusively on wild plants and animals to a lifeway where virtually every human on the planet today is dependent in some manner on domesticated plants and animals. The research uses biogeochemistry to reconstruct diet and nutrition, mechanobiology to document changes in workload and mobility, and paleopathology of oral and general health to infer exposure to pathogens and other factors that cause physiological stress. Our research from prehistoric settings in North America, Europe, and western Asia reveals a general pattern of declining health and wellbeing and changes in activity, workload, and living circumstances. These health and lifestyle outcomes are linked to the increasing role of plant carbohydrates in diet, living in larger, more densely-settled communities, changing activity patterns and workload, and altering circumstances that promote infectious disease.My field and laboratory research investigates the human impacts of major changes in diet, especially involving the adoption of and increased focus on the production and consumption of domesticated plants, a complex process taking place in the last 10,000 years of human evolution.

VLawler studies fractal and geometric properties of random walk and Brownian motion both for their own sake and to help analyze atypical behavior that arises in models with very strong interactions.  These models often arise in the study of critical phenoma in statistical physics.  Walks with self-repulsion such as the self-avoiding walk, the loop-erased walk, and interfaces of random fields are of particular interest.  In planar models where there are conformally invariant limits, complex analysis plays a strong role. Recent work has centered on planar continuum models such as the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) and the Brownian loop measure.Lawler studies fractal and geometric properties of random walk and Brownian motion both for their own sake and to help analyze atypical behavior that arises in models with very strong interactions.  These models often arise in the study of critical phenoma in statistical physics.  Walks with self-repulsion such as the self-avoiding walk, the loop-erased walk, and interfaces of random fields are of particular interest.  In planar models where there are conformally invariant limits, complex analysis plays a strong role.

Throughout his career he has examined ground shaking recordings to determine space-time complexity of seismic energy release from large earthquakes, helping to originate the asperity model of fault surface frictional heterogeneity and its many embellishments. He collaborated with Don Helmberger in discovering a shear velocity discontinuity in the lower mantle that is now generally interpreted as a manifestation of a phase change in the most abundant mantle mineral, silicate perovskite. He analyzes regional and teleseismic recordings of ground shaking to identify and measure the yields of underground explosions.

VMitchell Lazar studies the transcriptional regulation of metabolism. He discovered several nuclear receptors as well as nuclear receptor corepressor complexes containing the chromatin modulating enzyme histone deacetylase 3. Lazar's work has identified molecular mechanisms by which nuclear receptors and corepressors interact with the genome, and how this is controlled in a tissue-specific manner. He has discovered physiological roles of the nuclear receptors and corepressor complexes and the mechanisms by which they function in the epigenome to maintain homeostasis in the face of nutritive, circadian, and temperature challenges. He is especially interested in the circadian nuclear receptor Rev-erb alpha, a key repressive component of the circadian clock that utilizes the corepressor complex to coordinate metabolism and biological rhythms. Lazar has also made seminal discoveries related to PPAR gamma, a nuclear receptor that is a master regulator of adipocyte biology, and a transcriptional link between obesity and insulin resistance. The molecular, cellular, and integrative biology of these factors are being studied in mice and humans. His lab also discovered resistin, a hormone and target of PPAR gamma that is made by fat cells in rodents and by macrophages in humans.Mitchell Lazar studies the transcriptional regulation of metabolism.

VLeDoux's research has focused on the brain mechanisms of emotion and memory. He has explored this topic through research on Pavlovian threat (fear) conditioning since the early 1980s.  His work has helped identify the neural circuits and cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the acquisition, consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction, and expression of threat conditioning. LeDoux has long argued that the neural mechanisms that detect and respond to threats operate unconsciously, and are distinct from the circuits that give rise to conscious feelings of fear.  The latter, he suggests, can be studied in humans but cannot be studied scientifically in animals.  He argues that using the same term, "fear," to describe circuits that detect and respond to threats and circuits that consciously experience fear is a source of confusion and a hindrance to progress in understand what fear is and how it affects the lives of people.LeDoux's research has focused on the brain mechanisms of emotion and memory.

VMeave's research interests, focus on Cenozoic mammalian evolution, with emphasis on primate and human evolution. Her research activities are both field and lab based. The annual interdisciplinary expeditions of the Koobi Fora Research Project (KFRP), to the Turkana Basin, northern Kenya include geologists, paleontologists, geophysicists, geochemists and paleobotanists. These expeditions survey the badlands for fossil evidence of early human ancestors and the fauna that lived alongside these ancestors. The fossils and the geological context in which they are found provide the means to reconstruct past faunas, habitats and climates. In particular the analyses of stable carbon isotopes have shed considerable light on the paleoenvironments in which our ancestors lived, climate changes through time, and the dietary preferences of different vertebrates species. Over the past 45 years, the KFRP has discovered numerous new vertebrate species. Of particular importance are the spectacular fossil hominin discoveries, which have enhanced the understanding of our own evolutionary past prior to the emergence of Homo sapiens. Together with colleagues, Meave has described new species of early apes, monkeys and human ancestors, including Australopithecus anamensis, the earliest known australopithecine, and Kenyanthropus platyops, which provides evidence of diversity in the human fossil record 3.5 million years ago.Meave's research interests, focus on Cenozoic mammalian evolution, with emphasis on primate and human evolution.

VDr. Lee's work focuses on how long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) function as epigenetic switches in gene regulation. Using X-chromosome inactivation as a model, her laboratory has pioneered understanding of mechanisms driving  without a change in the DNA code.   Her investigations into lncRNAs -- now known as the \u201cdark matter\u201d of the genome  -- have helped to elucidate why >95% of our genome is noncoding and why the dark matter is expressed even though they do not make protein.  Her lab's work has shown that lncRNAs can exert powerful control over genes through their ability to attract and evict protein factors, as well as through their influence over chromosome architecture.

VRichard Borshay Lee's research interests have evolved over time. His early work at the University of California Berkeley, at Harvard and at Rutgers (1963-72) focused on the evolution of human behavior and the possible light that could be shed on the topic by studies of still-viable hunting and gathering societies like the !Kung San (Bushmen) of Botswana. He approached the subject through the methodological lens of ecological anthropology pioneered by Julian Steward. Moving to the University of Toronto, in the 1970s, Lee expanded his focus toward the central themes of social and cultural anthropology, the study of kinship, social and political organization, economics, and religion of traditional non-western non-state societies. Methodologically he was strongly influenced by the neo-Marxist theories of Eleanor Leacock, Eric Wolf and Marshall Sahlins. By the 1980s Lee had become actively involved in global campaigns for the rights of indigenous people facing rapid change, and in southern Africa particularly, the struggle to defeat Apartheid. In the 1990s and 2000s, as the crisis of HIV/AIDS began to emerge in Africa, Lee turned his attention to medical anthropology, conducting research and developing capacity building programs to address the health crisis. His work has always sought to bridge the divides between biological, historical, and socio-cultural perspectives in Anthropology.Richard Borshay Lee's research interests have evolved over time.

VThe Laboratory of Living Matter, headed by Stanislas Leibler at the Rockefeller University, is interested in collective phenomena taking place in biological systems. Collective phenomena involving many interacting components can be observed and studied on different levels of organization, ranging from assemblies of molecules to assemblies of cells. Leibler and his collaborators strive to understand quantitatively such phenomena in simple microbial systems. After contributing to the system description of cellular assemblies and biochemical networks as well as to the creation of synthetic genetic networks, they are now focusing their efforts on the investigation of microbial populations. In particular, the laboratory is continuing its quantitative studies of collective survival strategies in bacteria (such as bacterial persistence, sporulation or non-genetic behavioral individuality) and of population dynamics in closed microbial ecosystems. These experimental studies are performed in parallel with related theoretical work done at the Rockefeller University and at the Simons Center for Systems Biology at the Institute for Advanced Study.The Laboratory of Living Matter, headed by Stanislas Leibler at the Rockefeller University, is interested in collective phenomena taking place in biological systems.

Specifically, the lab has elucidated key actions of IL-2 in promoting T helper cell differentiation, the role of IL-21 in autoimmune disease and B cell differentiation, the role of TSLP in allergic inflammation, and made broad mechanistic insights into the actions of these cytokines, particularly via STAT proteins, including in their global regulation of gene expression based in part of the use of genomewide next generation sequencing. Work from the lab also contributed to the scientific foundation for the development of JAK inhibitors and the first study of partial agonists for a cytokine.Warren J.

Leonard is an immunologist and world leader in the area of cytokines. He is particularly known for cloning the IL-2 receptor \u03b1 chain, co-discovering IL-2R\u03b2, and demonstrating that the IL-2 receptor \u03b3 chain is mutated in human Xlinked severe-combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) and is a shared receptor component by multiple cytokines. He also discovered JAK3- and IL7R-deficient SCID, cloned IL-21R, and elucidated the biology, signaling, induced expression patterns, and molecular regulation of \u03b3 c-family cytokines, with discoveries leading to novel diagnostics and therapeutics.

VMarsha Lester has developed innovative methods for generating and characterizing open-shell complexes between a free radical and inert or reactive partner, e.g. OH-Ar, OH-H2, OH-CO, and reactive intermediates, e.g. HOONO, HOOO, CH2OO, enabling her to map out important, yet previously uncharted, regions of chemical reaction pathways. She demonstrated that reactive partners could be trapped in a shallow entrance channel reaction well, employed novel laser-based techniques to activate their intra- and inter-molecular vibrations, and followed their dynamics. Of particular note, she observed the bending vibrations of OH-CO that probe the reaction path leading directly to the HOCO transition state. She discovered remarkable changes in their intermolecular potentials upon OH electronic excitation, and obtained dynamical signatures of both reactive and nonreactive electronic quenching outcomes. She characterized the structure and stability of HOONO, a critical intermediate for NOx atmospheric chemistry. Recently, Lester obtained the UV spectra of several long-sought Criegee intermediates, carbonyl oxides arising from alkene ozonolysis in the troposphere, revealing their rapid photochemical decay. Her studies of vibrationally activated Criegee intermediates have identified the rate and effective barrier for a critical hydrogen transfer step that leads to OH radicals, which is a substantial source of this key oxidant in the atmosphere.Marsha Lester has developed innovative methods for generating and characterizing open-shell complexes between a free radical and inert or reactive partner, e.g. OH-Ar, OH-H2, OH-CO, and reactive intermediates, e.g. HOONO, HOOO, CH2OO, enabling her to map out important, yet previously uncharted, regions of chemical reaction pathways.

VMargaret Levi attempts to understand the conditions under which individuals act beyond their narrow economic interests in situations where logic suggests that self-interest should triumph.  In her research on taxation, conscription, unions, state-building, and supply chains, she finds that leadership, trustworthiness, power and norms complement more conventional accounts emphasizing interests and institutions. She has explored her puzzle across multiple countries, cultures and history using analytic narratives. The narrative elucidates the principal players, their preferences, the key decision points and possibilities, and the rules of the game in a textured and sequenced account; the analytic requires evaluation of the model through comparative statics and the testable implications the model generates. Most recently she has investigated what kinds of governance arrangements make it possible to for leaders to successfully ask members to undertake costly actions in the interest of others.  The answer lies in the development of an expanded community of fate, in which individuals understand their own well-being as implicated with that of others beyond their narrow circle of family and tribe.  Levi\u2019s ultimate aim is to develop a better account of what promotes productive relationships between citizens and their governments.Margaret Levi attempts to understand the conditions under which individuals act beyond their narrow economic interests in situations where logic suggests that self-interest should triumph.  In her research on taxation, conscription, unions, state-building, and supply chains, she finds that leadership, trustworthiness, power and norms complement more conventional accounts emphasizing interests and institutions.

VI have long been interested in the field of non-equilibrium statistical physics applied to the self-organization of both non-living and living matter. In the earlier parts of my career, I studied patterning in a variety of condensed-matter systems, namely crystal growth, unstable multiphase fluid flow, nonlinear chemical waves, and the dynamics of rapid fracture of brittle materials. Starting around 1990, I began applying the physics of non-equilibrium complex systems to advance our quantitative understanding of biological systems. Indeed, problems such as stress-induced bacterial colony structuring, the aggregation of Dictyostelium amoebae to form rudimentary multicellular organisms, and nonlinear intracellular calcium waves that convey information across the cell, can all be treated as examples of evolution making use of the principles of non-equilibrium self-organization. Most recently, I have engaged in a joint theory-experiment effort devoted to eukaryotic chemotaxis, how cells use chemical gradients to bias their motility. This is at heart another pattern formation problem, as a cell must use external information to set up an internal chemical structure such that different non-equilibrium states exist at the front, back, and sides of the cell; these different states then govern the downstream mechanics, which then actually causes motion.I have long been interested in the field of non-equilibrium statistical physics applied to the self-organization of both non-living and living matter.

VAlexander Levitzki is recognized for his contributions to enzymology, signal transduction and signal transduction therapy. Initially he became known for his work on the allosteric regulation of regulatory enzymes. He developed methods to study coopertaivity and the phenomenon of half-of-the-sites reactivity. He later moved to the study of the mode of coupling of beta adrenergic receptors with G proteins. In this field he has shown that one receptor can activate many adenylyl cyclase molecules (\u2018collision coupling\u201d), and that the Gs protein remains associated with the enzyme throughout the cycle with no loss of the beta-gamma subunits. Genetic studies on the G protein of the mating system of S.cerevisiae confirm that the G protein remains intact during the activation cycle. In parallel to these studies the Levitzki laboratory became known to generate the first tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitors (Tyrphostins, TKIs) that do not inhibit Ser/Thr kinases. The Levitzki laboratory was the first to generate inhibitors for EGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR2, Bcr-Abl and Jak2. This work stimulated the development of Gleevec and 15 other kinase inhibitors, used in the clinic with dozens in development. Recently he developed an IGF1R/Stat3 dual inhibitor for that inhibit the tumor as well as the tumor microenvironment. In parallel, since 2006 the Levitzki laboratory develops vectors that deliver polyinosine/polycytosine (PolyIC) to tumors.Alexander Levitzki is recognized for his contributions to enzymology, signal transduction and signal transduction therapy.

VAlexander Levitzki was born in Jerusalem and studied chemistry and microbiology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he received his M.Sc degree in 1963. He then served in the army and went to graduate for his Ph.D at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovoth. He developed polyhistidine/Cu as a model for oxidases and published his work (with I.Pecht) in Nature. He then went to the University of California, Berkeley to work with Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. with whom he made seminal contributions to the studies on allosteric enzymes. In 1971 he assumed a faculty position at the Weizmann Institute where he received tenure in 1974. At the Institute the Levitzki laboratory continued to make seminal contributions to the field of allosteric regulation and began his work on signal transduction of G protein coupled receptors. In 1975 Levitzki moved the Hebrew University and continued the research he began at the Weizmann Institute on the beta-adrenergic receptor and its mode of coupling to Gs. In his laboratory in Jerusalem Levitzki is working on the development of various cancer therapies using small molecules and vectors that target PolyIC to the tumor , thus recruiting the immune system to attack the tumor.Alexander Levitzki was born in Jerusalem and studied chemistry and microbiology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem where he received his M.Sc degree in 1963.

VJames Liao\u2019s laboratory is working on the design and construction of non-native metabolic networks, particularly in microorganisms, but also in plants and higher animals. They have developed biosynthetic pathways for producing various alcohols with 3 to 8 carbons. The pathways are transferred to various microorganisms to convert lignocellulose, waste proteins, and atmospheric CO to fuels.  To optimize the efficiency of conversion, they combined computational, genetic, and biochemical approaches to increase the driving force towards the desired flux. To increase the carbon efficiency, they redesigned the native carbon assimilation pathways for sugar and one-carbon compound assimilation. They developed a cyclic pathway involving phosphoketolase and carbon rearrangement to digest sugar phosphate to two-carbon metabolites in a non-oxidative manner without carbon loss. They combined this concept with native methanol assimilation to achieve a synthetic methanol condensation cycle that converts methanol to ethanol and n-butanol without carbon loss. They also reversed glyoxylate shunt to afford conversion of C4 metabolites to C2 metabolites, which is a critical step in artificial CO fixation.James Liao\u2019s laboratory is working on the design and construction of non-native metabolic networks, particularly in microorganisms, but also in plants and higher animals.

VLichtman\u2019s research focuses on the study of neural connectivity and how it changes as animals develop and age. With his colleagues he has developed a number of tools that permit synaptic level analysis of neural connections. These include activity dependent uptake of fluorescent dyes, transgenic approaches to label individual nerve cells, and \u201ccombinatoric\u201d methods (e.g., DiOlistics, Brainbow, and NPS) to label many nerve cells in the same tissue. In addition he has helped develop automated electron microscopy approaches for large scale neural circuit reconstruction. These connectomic methods seek to make it routine to acquire neural circuit data in any nervous system. The central focus of his work is to describe the ways in which developing nervous systems change to accommodate information that is acquired by experience. Much of this work has centered on the mammalian peripheral nervous system which undergoes profound activity-dependent circuit reorganizations in early life causing axons to prune most of their branches while strengthen a small subset in a competitive process called synapse elimination. The dynamic changes that occur in circuits has required not only describing circuits in great detail at one time point but also visualizing how connections change over minutes, months and even years using vital imaging approaches.Lichtman\u2019s research focuses on the study of neural connectivity and how it changes as animals develop and age.

VMy research interests concentrate on promoters and genes and their mechanisms of regulation. For many years, my laboratory has focused on a few highly-inducible heat shock (HS) genes in drosophila as models, and these studies led to the discovery of a key transcriptional regulatory step of RNA polymerase II promoter-proximal pausing. More recently, using genome-wide assays that we developed in both drosophila and mammals, we have shown this regulation is general. To examine the molecular mechanics of this regulation in living cells, we employed existing technology and developed new approaches designed to inhibit the activities or interactions of specific transcription factors. Our current efforts examine the consequences of these specific inhibitions in vivo using high-resolution and genome-wide assays. One important strategy we developed uses RNA aptamers that are selected to bind and inhibit specific target proteins. We have improved the efficiency of RNA aptamer selections and are expressing aptamers against critical transcription factors in cells and animals. The rapid expression of these aptamers in vivo when coupled with our high resolution, genome-wide assays is revealing novel mechanistic insights to molecular mechanisms of transcription regulation.  Our plan is to expand this approach to examine the role of many key transcription factors.My research interests concentrate on promoters and genes and their mechanisms of regulation.

VMy lab develops and uses a variety of strategies to probe the structure of promoters and genes and the regulation of their activities in living cells. We have studied the factors and mechanisms that drive transcription and its regulation for decades. While our primary model system has been the highly-inducible heat shock (HS) genes in Drosophila, we have over the past several years become deeply committed to developing and using genome-wide assays in Drosophila and mammalian cell lines to measure, often with base pair precision, the process of transcription and the interaction of regulatory transcription factors. The challenging problem being addressed in this proposal is to examine the functional interactions of human regulatory elements and promoters that is so essential to understanding how genomes are regulated. We will address this important regulatory problem with the powerful high-throughput methods developed by my collaborator, Dr. Yaiyuan Yu and our own novel variation of the powerful published STARR-seq protocol by the Stark Lab. These highthroughput methods will identify key enhancers as well as variants and mutants with strong phenotypes that will then be tested in a rigorous manner using transgenic genetic lines where variant and mutated versions are at there native locus. The molecular interplays of the enhancers and selected variants/mutants will be explored with a battery of highly sensitive, and high resolution genome approaches.My lab develops and uses a variety of strategies to probe the structure of promoters and genes and the regulation of their activities in living cells.

VAndrea Liu\u2019s research combines theory and computation to study soft and living matter. In living matter, her research focuses on the role of mechanics in biology, with the aim of understanding how new and general collective phenomena, often beyond those typically observed in inanimate soft matter, can emerge at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels. In soft matter, she and her collaborators have shown that jamming produces solids at an opposite pole from perfect crystals, providing a new way of thinking about the nature of rigidity in disordered solids. The nonequilibrium jamming transition and jammed state thus serve as useful starting points for understanding a broad class of materials, including glasses.Andrea Liu\u2019s research combines theory and computation to study soft and living matter.

VRichard Locksley\u2019s laboratory is interested in pathways underlying the elicitation of allergic immunity. His laboratory contributed to the understanding of subsets of helper T cells that lead to different types of immune responses, and to the discovery in 2010 of Group 2 innate lymphoid cells, or ILC2s, whose biology remains a major focus of investigation. Using novel strains of mice genetically manipulated to reveal cellular production of short-lived cytokines, the Locksley lab has been able to establish pathways mediated by ILC2s that contribute to basal physiology and tissue health. These studies have revealed unexpected roles for these rare innate lymphoid cells in adipose tissue and systemic metabolic homeostasis, and in epithelia of the lung, small intestine, and other organs where cytokines from ILC2s activate gene programs in epithelial cells important in controlling the physical barrier separating tissues from the outside world. In the lung, ILC2s enhance secretion by specialized lung epithelial cells of chitinase, which degrades ubiquitous, environmentally acquired, insoluble chitin polysaccharides that induce lung inflammation. In the small intestine, ILC2s relay signals from tuft cells, rare epithelial cells that transduce luminal signals from the gut through ILC2s, which regulate cell-fate decisions of intestinal crypt progenitor cells.Richard Locksley\u2019s laboratory is interested in pathways underlying the elicitation of allergic immunity.

They also interrogate the genes and processes that drive cancer, explore how they interact to produce distinct tumor phenotypes, and attempt to identify cancer specific vulnerabilities for targeting therapeutically. Their approach combines mouse models, genetic tools, and cancer genomics in a coordinated manner that allows them to study cancer gene networks in a comprehensive way. Current projects in the laboratory focus on p53 action and the consequences of various p53 mutations, the roles and regulation of cellular senescence in cancer and aging, and how loss of function mutations in tumor suppressor genes sustain tumor maintenance. They also are developing powerful genetic approaches and non-germline mouse models to accelerate the pace at which cancer genes can be studied in vivo, and are using functional genomics to interrogate oncogenic mechanisms and identify new therapeutic targets.Scott Lowe\u2019s laboratory studies tumor suppressor gene action in order to identify key regulatory nodes controlling basic cellular processes and to reveal the strategies nature uses to combat cancer.

VGigi Lozano directs a research laboratory that studies the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in vivo using mouse models. Her laboratory characterized the function of p53 as a transcriptional activator which laid the foundation for numerous studies on transcription functions and targets of p53. They also determined the physiological importance of Mdm2 and Mdm4 proteins as inhibitors of p53 activity and further probed this exquisite relationship showing that minor changes in Mdm2 levels via polymorphisms directly impact cancer risk. Her laboratory further demonstrated the importance of the Mdm proteins in regulating p53 in numerous cell types including stem cells. Mouse models with p53 missense mutations firmly established the gain-of-function phenotype of a common p53 mutation and its mechanism of action, while a separation-of-function p53 mutant showed that the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and senescence (in the absence of apoptosis) are also tumor suppressive functions of p53. Her laboratory also showed that mutant p53 is inherently unstable similar to wild type p53, but is stabilized in tumors by DNA damage signals. Lastly, a therapeutic model highlights the unexpected finding that breast tumors with mutant p53 respond better to treatment with DNA damaging agents.Gigi Lozano directs a research laboratory that studies the p53 tumor suppressor pathway in vivo using mouse models.

VVicki Lundblad\u2019s long-term research interest has been directed at elucidating the mechanisms required for telomere function.  This initiated with her discovery that a defect in telomere replication in budding yeast leads to replicative senescence, well before telomere attrition was shown to be the causative factor for senescence in mammalian cells.  She subsequently showed that this block to cellular proliferation could nevertheless be bypassed, through a recombination-based pathway that provides an alternative means of replenishing chromosome ends in the absence of telomerase.  These mechanistic observations were conducted in parallel with the discovery of the protein subunits of the telomerase holoenzyme, also in budding yeast.  Analysis of the Est1 telomerase subunit has revealed that telomerase is actively recruited to chromosome ends, through an interaction between Est1 and a telomere-bound protein called Cdc13.  Furthermore, her work, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Cech, led to the long-awaited discovery of the catalytic subunit of telomerase.  In parallel, her group has shown that telomere homeostasis also relies on a telomere-dedicated RPA-like (t-RPA) complex, thereby demonstrating that multiple RPA complexes make distinct contributions to genomic stability.Vicki Lundblad\u2019s long-term research interest has been directed at elucidating the mechanisms required for telomere function.  This initiated with her discovery that a defect in telomere replication in budding yeast leads to replicative senescence, well before telomere attrition was shown to be the causative factor for senescence in mammalian cells.  She subsequently showed that this block to cellular proliferation could nevertheless be bypassed, through a recombination-based pathway that provides an alternative means of replenishing chromosome ends in the absence of telomerase.  These mechanistic observations were conducted in parallel with the discovery of the protein subunits of the telomerase holoenzyme, also in budding yeast.  Analysis of the Est1 telomerase subunit has revealed that telomerase is actively recruited to chromosome ends, through an interaction between Est1 and a telomere-bound protein called Cdc13.  Furthermore, her work, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Cech, led to the long-awaited discovery of the catalytic subunit of telomerase.  In parallel, her group has shown that telomere homeostasis also relies on a telomere-dedicated RPA-like (t-RPA) complex, thereby demonstrating that multiple RPA complexes make distinct contributions to genomic stability.Vicki Lundblad\u2019s long-term research interest has been directed at elucidating the mechanisms required for telomere function.  This initiated with her discovery that a defect in telomere replication in budding yeast leads to replicative senescence, well before telomere attrition was shown to be the causative factor for senescence in mammalian cells.  She subsequently showed that this block to cellular proliferation could nevertheless be bypassed, through a recombination-based pathway that provides an alternative means of replenishing chromosome ends in the absence of telomerase.  These mechanistic observations were conducted in parallel with the discovery of the protein subunits of the telomerase holoenzyme, also in budding yeast.  Analysis of the Est1 telomerase subunit has revealed that telomerase is actively recruited to chromosome ends, through an interaction between Est1 and a telomere-bound protein called Cdc13.  Furthermore, her work, in collaboration with Dr. Thomas Cech, led to the long-awaited discovery of the catalytic subunit of telomerase.  In parallel, her group has shown that telomere homeostasis also relies on a telomere-dedicated RPA-like (t-RPA) complex, thereby demonstrating that multiple RPA complexes make distinct contributions to genomic stability.

VVicki Lundblad is a molecular geneticist who has focused on the biology of telomere replication in budding yeast.  Her work has provided multiple insights into how the enzyme telomerase, which elongates chromosome ends, is regulated in vivo.  Lundblad, who is a third-generation Californian, was born in the Bay Area as the daughter of a biochemist and a school teacher.  Her undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley initially focused on mathematics but she switched to biology, which led her to pursue her Ph.D. at Harvard University as Nancy Kleckner\u2019s first graduate student.  Her interest in telomere biology initiated with her postdoctoral research in Jack Szostak\u2019s lab in the early 1980\u2019s, followed by a second postdoctoral stint in Elizabeth Blackburn\u2019s lab.  Lundblad became a faculty member of the Genetics department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX in 1991, and subsequently moved to the Salk Institute of Biological Studies in 2004.Vicki Lundblad is a molecular geneticist who has focused on the biology of telomere replication in budding yeast.  Her work has provided multiple insights into how the enzyme telomerase, which elongates chromosome ends, is regulated in vivo.  Lundblad, who is a third-generation Californian, was born in the Bay Area as the daughter of a biochemist and a school teacher.  Her undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley initially focused on mathematics but she switched to biology, which led her to pursue her Ph.D. at Harvard University as Nancy Kleckner\u2019s first graduate student.  Her interest in telomere biology initiated with her postdoctoral research in Jack Szostak\u2019s lab in the early 1980\u2019s, followed by a second postdoctoral stint in Elizabeth Blackburn\u2019s lab.  Lundblad became a faculty member of the Genetics department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX in 1991, and subsequently moved to the Salk Institute of Biological Studies in 2004.Vicki Lundblad is a molecular geneticist who has focused on the biology of telomere replication in budding yeast.  Her work has provided multiple insights into how the enzyme telomerase, which elongates chromosome ends, is regulated in vivo.  Lundblad, who is a third-generation Californian, was born in the Bay Area as the daughter of a biochemist and a school teacher.  Her undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley initially focused on mathematics but she switched to biology, which led her to pursue her Ph.D. at Harvard University as Nancy Kleckner\u2019s first graduate student.  Her interest in telomere biology initiated with her postdoctoral research in Jack Szostak\u2019s lab in the early 1980\u2019s, followed by a second postdoctoral stint in Elizabeth Blackburn\u2019s lab.  Lundblad became a faculty member of the Genetics department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX in 1991, and subsequently moved to the Salk Institute of Biological Studies in 2004.

VMy work focuses on the process of bacterial cell division. Bacteria are the smallest living organisms but must carry out many of the spatially and temporally complex tasks of larger eukaryotic cells to divide and produce progeny cells. Most, if not all cells, divide by assembly of a cytoskeletal element, which is spatially and temporally regulated, at the future division site that functions as a scaffold for assembly of the division machinery. Our work demonstrates that bacteria use FtsZ, which assembles into a cytoskeletal element designated the Z ring. Furthermore, FtsZ is widely conserved in the prokaryotic world indicating it arose early in evolution. Importantly FtsZ is the ancestral homologue of eukaryotic tubulin, establishing that the eukaryotic cytoskeleton had its origins in bacteria. In the bacterium E. coli, assembly of the Z ring is a key regulatory point for temporal and spatial regulation of division. Our work has demonstrated that this occurs largely through negative regulation and has contributed to the mechanisms utilized by these regulators. Our current work continues to examine the assembly of the Z ring and the process of its maturation into a large molecular machine that can divide the cell.My work focuses on the process of bacterial cell division.

VWolfgang Lutz is substantively interested in the role of population factors in sustainable development and methodologically in a wide range of applications of demographic methods to capturing and forecasting social and economic changes. For the past decades, his main interest has been in the field of global population forecasts, both in terms of probabilistic projections and multi-dimensional age-, sex- and education-specific scenarios. In this context he has also focused on the drivers of long-term fertility trends in Africa and on how low birth rates can fall in Europe and Asia. He has operationalized the model of \u201cDemographic Metabolism\u201d which explains social change on the basis of intergenerational differences in relevant characteristics and is one of the few models of social change with predictive power. This model has been particularly powerful for reconstructing and projecting the changing compositions of populations by level of educational attainment. As a consequence, he has become interested in empirically estimating the consequences of increasing human capital in an age- and gender-specific way, ranging from economic growth to health to quality of institutions and adaptive capacity to environmental change. He has also a long record in trying to understand and quantitatively model the complex population-development-environment interactions globally and in specific case studies and he applies this in trying to forecast societies\u2019 future adaptive capacities to climate change.Wolfgang Lutz is substantively interested in the role of population factors in sustainable development and methodologically in a wide range of applications of demographic methods to capturing and forecasting social and economic changes.

VI am a geneticist, interested in understanding how multiple interacting molecular polymorphisms and environmental factors cause phenotypic variation in quantitative (complex) traits within and between populations and species. Using fruit flies (Drosophila) as a model system, I have used transposon tagging, high-resolution recombination mapping, genetic complementation tests, and whole genome transcript profiling to identify novel genes affecting morphology, lifespan, behaviors, stress resistance and human disease. I have shown that the genetic basis of quantitative traits is highly complex, and that new mutations and segregating alleles affecting variation in these traits have effects that are conditional on sex, genetic background and the external environment. However, individual DNA polymorphisms affect variation in quantitative traits via networks of interacting transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. Thus I have been recently interested in developing Drosophila resources and computational approaches to integrate genotype-phenotype relationships across multiple levels of biological organization to uncover entire genetic pathways that affect variation of quantitative traits. These studies provide candidate genes for studying homologous traits in other species, including humans; and improve our ability to predict responses of complex traits to natural and artificial selection.I am a geneticist, interested in understanding how multiple interacting molecular polymorphisms and environmental factors cause phenotypic variation in quantitative (complex) traits within and between populations and species.

VAs a physician scientist my research interest is in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying autoimmune rheumatic diseases and applying the knowledge gained to improving the health of patients with these common disabling diseases. At the beginning of my scientific career in 1968, the aetiology and pathogenesis of these disorders was obscure but it was becoming clear that immunity and inflammation played a part. The characterisation of cytokines at the protein and DNA level in the early 1980s and their availability as tools focussed my research into investigating their role in the biology and pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In collaborative studies with Marc Feldmann using patient derived cell culture and vivo animal models the concept was established that TNF alpha played a key role in inflammation and joint damage observed in RA. In seminal clinical trials the efficacy of TNF blockade by a specific anti-TNF antibody, augmented by co-therapy with low dose methotrexate, was established and is now widely applied as a standard of care for RA. In mechanism of action studies TNF blockade was shown to impact on immune cell recruitment and angiogenesis by down regulating several cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. Understanding why disease remission is rarely achieved remains a challenge for future research.As a physician scientist my research interest is in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying autoimmune rheumatic diseases and applying the knowledge gained to improving the health of patients with these common disabling diseases.

VLong-lasting activity-dependent changes in the efficacy of synaptic communication play an important role in the development of neural circuits and are critically involved in many forms of learning and memory. Furthermore, pathological disruption of the plasticity of synapses plays an important role in many psychiatric disorders. Therefore elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which these synaptic modifications occur has profound implications for understanding many important brain functions including how future behavior is modified by past experience. Work from my laboratory has demonstrated that there are a variety of related but mechanistically distinct forms of synaptic plasticity. A major goal of my laboratory is to elucidate both the specific molecular events that are responsible for the triggering of these various forms of synaptic plasticity and the exact modifications in synaptic proteins that are responsible for the observed, long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy. To accomplish this we use cellular electrophysiological recording techniques to examine synaptic plasticity in a variety of different in vitro preparations. We also use molecular techniques to examine the activity-dependent modulation of neurotransmitter receptors and to manipulate synaptic proteins so that their exact functions can be determined. The results of this work have had a major influence on our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory as well as how disruption in brain plasticity mechanisms contribute to mental illness.Long-lasting activity-dependent changes in the efficacy of synaptic communication play an important role in the development of neural circuits and are critically involved in many forms of learning and memory.

VJitendra Malik studies computer vision.  In the course of this work, he has drawn on and contributed to various areas of applied mathematics.  His collaborators and he have developed techniques that enable one to reconstruct three-dimensional models of objects in the world from images, and then produce photo-realistic renderings from novel viewpoints or in novel lighting.  Other research has been on methods for segmenting images and video into groups that correspond to objects or parts of objects. Jitendra\u2019s group has devised novel learning based approaches to visual recognition, such as for finding instances of object categories such faces, giraffes, the digit 5, or chairs, and actions such as running, jumping, or riding a horse.  They have developed algorithms, which can detect people in images and identify their body part configurations, or track and count cars in traffic video.  Jitendra\u2019s approach to computer vision draws inspiration and insight from the work of psychologists and neuroscientists, and contributes to computational modeling of biological vision.

VJames L. Manley is a leader in the broad field of eukaryotic gene expression. He has made multiple important discoveries in this area over the course of the last quarter century. Manley and colleagues identified and characterized the key factors responsible for polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, and elucidated how this remarkably complex machinery functions in gene regulation, for example during cell growth and differentiation. He has also studied the mechanism and regulation of the process by which introns are removed from mRNA precursors, mRNA splicing. Manley and his coworkers discovered the first alternative splicing factor (SR protein), characterized how this and other splicing regulatory proteins function and are themselves regulated, showed how alternative splicing can become deregulated in disease, and with respect to mechanism demonstrated that two spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs by themselves have catalytic activity. Finally, he elucidated unexpected links between these mRNA processing reactions and transcription, DNA damage signaling and maintenance of genomic stability. His work has thus provided considerable insight into the complex mechanisms that are essential for the regulated production of mRNAs in mammalian cells.James L.

VI first demonstrated that a human disease could be due to a pre-mRNA splicing defect by studying the metabolism of Beta-globin RNA in bone-marrow aspirates from patients with Beta+-thalassemia (1980). Initial clues about nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) derived from our subsequent studies of patients with Beta0-thalassemia (1981), which my lab recapitulated by examining the molecular basis of a different inherited disorder (1988). NMD generally targets mRNAs that prematurely terminate translation to prevent the production of abnormally shortened proteins that can be toxic to cells. By so doing, NMD protects cells not only from disease-associated mutations but also from frequent mistakes routinely made during pre-mRNA processing. We lab found that cells distinguish termination codons that trigger NMD from those that do not based on where splicing occurs within pre-mRNA (1994). We also discovered that NMD in humans is restricted to newly synthesized mRNA (1994). These results led to discoveries of exon-junction complexes (2000, in collaboration with Melissa Moore), which we showed stably contains NMD factors (2002), and a new template for protein synthesis that we call the pioneer translation initiation complex (2000). We also uncovered Staufen-mediated mRNA decay, which is mechanistically related to NMD (2005) and competes with NMD (2008), and new roles for long noncoding RNAs and Alu elements (2011). My lab continues to study normal and disease-associated human RNA metabolism.I first demonstrated that a human disease could be due to a pre-mRNA splicing defect by studying the metabolism of Beta-globin RNA in bone-marrow aspirates from patients with Beta+-thalassemia (1980).

VMuch of my work has addressed how children categorize the world, how categories drive the inductive inferences children make, and how language impacts these processes. My collaborators and I have shown that hearing two dissimilar objects called by the same label allows children to view them as the same kind of thing which, in turn, further enables children to infer that the objects share nonobvious properties. Language is, then, a powerful means of freeing children from being perceptually bound.Much of my work has addressed how children categorize the world, how categories drive the inductive inferences children make, and how language impacts these processes.

VHazel Markus\u2019s laboratory focuses on how culture shapes mind and behavior. She examines how many forms of culture (e.g., region of origin, ethnicity, race, social class, gender and occupation) influence the self, and in turn, psychological functioning, including cognition, emotion, motivation and intergroup processes. Her contributions include theories of self-schemas, possible selves, independent and interdependent models of agency, and culture cycles. Using a blend of experiments, surveys, and analyses of cultural products, her research investigates cultures as multilayered cycles of individuals, interactions, institutions, and ideas. Different blends of these culture cycles create different forms of agency.

She examines how many forms of culture (e.g., region of origin, ethnicity, race, social class, gender and occupation) influence the self, and in turn, psychological functioning, including cognition, emotion, motivation and intergroup processes. Her contributions include theories of self-schemas, possible selves, independent and interdependent models of agency, and culture cycles. Using a blend of experiments, surveys, and analyses of cultural products, her research investigates cultures as multilayered cycles of individuals, interactions, institutions, and ideas. Different blends of these culture cycles create different forms of agency.

VSusan Marqusee\u2019s laboratory is interested in deciphering the structural and dynamic information encoded in a protein\u2019s amino-acid sequence with the ultimate goal of understanding and predicting how changes in the sequence or environment affect a protein\u2019s energy landscape and function. She uses a combination of biophysical, structural, and computational techniques to both interrogate the energy landscape and develop new methodologies. The development of a single molecule optical tweezers approach to manipulate and observe protein conformational changes in real time provided the first glimpse of the unfolding and refolding trajectory of a single protein molecule. This approach has provided evidence for the on-pathway obligatory nature of an early folding intermediate and has identified new mechanical properties of proteins. Recent work has demonstrated the existence of parallel folding pathways in a simple two-state folding protein, clarifying an apparent discrepancy between experimental and theoretical studies and demonstrating that small changes in either the environment or sequence can alter the folding trajectory. The fundamental nature of Dr. Marqusee\u2019s work has significant impact on many other areas of research, ranging from the physical chemistry of macromolecules to the design of therapeutics that prevent the aggregation of proteins which lead to common diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s.Susan Marqusee\u2019s laboratory is interested in deciphering the structural and dynamic information encoded in a protein\u2019s amino-acid sequence with the ultimate goal of understanding and predicting how changes in the sequence or environment affect a protein\u2019s energy landscape and function.

VMartin Matzuk\u2019s laboratory is focused on 1) using functional genomics to investigate essential fertility pathways, reproductive tract cancers, and TGF-beta superfamily signaling in mammals and 2) applying chemical biology approaches to develop lead compounds for contraception, cancer, and debilitating diseases. In many cases, his team has taken a discovery-based approach to first uncover genes expressed exclusively in the male or female germ line and, subsequently, to define their roles in vivo using transgenic mouse models. In the process, they have identified novel genes involved in oocyte\u2013somatic cell interactions during ovarian folliculogenesis (e.g., GDF9 and BMP15), oocyte-to-embryo transition (e.g., ZAR1 and NPM2), germ-cell intercellular bridge formation (e.g., TEX14), acrosome formation (e.g., ZPBP1), and the piRNA pathway (e.g., GASZ), among others. If a gene knockout results specifically in a phenotype of male infertility, this gene product may be a promising drug target for contraception in men, and the Matzuk laboratory has begun to characterize small-molecule contraceptives to target the male germ line in vivo. They have successfully created unique mouse models to study ovarian cancer and to decipher the crosstalk of TGF-beta superfamily, hormonal, and small RNA signaling pathways in normal and diseased reproductive tissues and their roles during pregnancy.Martin Matzuk\u2019s laboratory is focused on 1) using functional genomics to investigate essential fertility pathways, reproductive tract cancers, and TGF-beta superfamily signaling in mammals and 2) applying chemical biology approaches to develop lead compounds for contraception, cancer, and debilitating diseases.

She is a longtime member of the scientific team that announced in 2016 the first direct detection of gravitational waves from colliding black holes by the Laser InterferometerGravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). The gravitational waves that LIGO detected are ripples in the spacetime fabric caused by the motion of compact, massive astrophysical objects such as black holes and neutron stars. Since the nature of gravitation is inherently different from electromagnetism, gravitational wave astrophysics provides a radically different window into the universe.Nergis Mavalvala, Marble Professor of Astrophysics at MIT and a 2010 recipient of a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d award, is a physicist whose research focuses on the detection of gravitational waves and quantum measurement science.

Since the nature of gravitation is inherently different from electromagnetism, gravitational wave astrophysics provides a radically different window into the universe.Nergis Mavalvala, Marble Professor of Astrophysics at MIT and a 2010 recipient of a MacArthur \u201cgenius\u201d award, is a physicist whose research focuses on the detection of gravitational waves and quantum measurement science.

VAs an astrophysicist, my most important contribution has been the detection of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a solar-type star, 51 Pegasi.  The orbital parameters of that jovian planet were quite unexpected, with its orbital period as short as 4 days.  It raised the attention on the crucial importance of orbital migration of planets.  This physical process is of importance to understand the amazing diversity of planetary systems.   During the last 40 years, I have been interested in the development of spectrographs optimised to get precise and accurate measurements of stellar velocities.  The last one of these instruments, the HARPS spectrograph, is precise enough to allow the discovery of a new, very rich population of low mass planets ontight orbits and allowed my collaborators and I to discover planets with masses close to that of the Earth's.  More recently we have also been involved  in the follow-up with Doppler measurements of transiting planet candidates.  However, the focus of my interest remains the detection of planets in the so-called habitable zone of their host star in order to prepare a list of targets for future experiments aimed at searching and detecting signatures of life outside our Solar System.As an astrophysicist, my most important contribution has been the detection of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a solar-type star, 51 Pegasi.

VEmploying a multi-disciplinary approach, Jitu Mayor\u2019s laboratory has developed new concepts (nanoscale complexes as units of meso-scale membrane organization), new tools (fluorescence anisotropy microscopy) and new methodologies (quantitative physical tools) to understand and study organization and dynamics of membranes in living cells. This has led an understanding of how a cell regulates local organization of its cell membrane constituents, from the nanometer scale in specialized domains in cell membranes (termed rafts) to the micron scale in endocytic pathways. His work has inspired a new picture of the cell membrane as an active composite of a fluid lipid bilayer intertwined with a dynamic cortical cytoskeleton immediately beneath. This has led to the use of the language of active mechanics in addition to existing equilibrium notions to understand how regulated lipid and protein assemblies arise in cell membranes. His work has also provided an understanding of mechanisms and roles for poorly appreciated mechanisms of endocytosis that do not deploy the classical clathrin and dynamin molecular players.  Together, Jitu Mayor\u2019s work is important for understanding how signaling reactions in cell membranes are influenced by local membrane composition and how the global composition of the cell membrane may be regulated.Employing a multi-disciplinary approach, Jitu Mayor\u2019s laboratory has developed new concepts (nanoscale complexes as units of meso-scale membrane organization), new tools (fluorescence anisotropy microscopy) and new methodologies (quantitative physical tools) to understand and study organization and dynamics of membranes in living cells.

VMolecular movement underlies all cellular processes. Substrates and hormones diffuse to enzymes and receptors, respectively, to initiate catalytic and signaling events. The binding of such molecules to one another generally requires internal motions, analogous to the fitting of a hand into a glove. The interactions of these molecules are highly selective to maintain order in the heavy molecular traffic in and around cells. Our group studies biomolecular and cellular activity by computer simulation of molecular motion. In molecular dynamics simulations, the atoms of a biological molecule--and often those in its solvent surroundings--are represented explicitly in a computer model, and Newton's equations of motion are applied to generate representative trajectories of the atoms. We have adapted such simulations to show how ligands bind to proteins, and how strongly. These methods have proved useful in drug-discovery applications, e.g., in the development of compounds that are now used for the treatment of HIV infections. We have also developed implicit treatments of solvent with corresponding descriptions of solute motion (Brownian dynamics), and shown how electrostatic interactions speed the diffusional encounter of certain enzymes and their substrates. At the largest scales, we are drawing on the increasing knowledge of the structure of cellular structures and of the physicochemical properties of their molecular components, to initiate simulation studies at the cellular level.Molecular movement underlies all cellular processes.

VFrank McCormick\u2019s lab is devoted to basic Ras discovery science and focuses on identifying new ways of treating disease driven by Ras proteins. They have identified the molecular basis of the effects in which K-Ras proteins promote stem-cell properties in cancer cells, enable them to establish metastatic tumors with high efficiency, and become drug resistant. The McCormick lab has identified small molecules that binds irreversibly to K-Ras and prevent prenylation. Another challenge they are tackling is the crystal structure of the K-Ras protein in hopes that any discovery could provide a new and safe way of blocking K-Ras function. With a developed collection of highly potent and specific siRNAs that target K-Ras and the components of the pathways, combinations of these siRNAs have resulted tumor destruction in vivo. They developed a system of expressing single Ras isoforms in a \u201cRas-less\u201d MEF background as a discovery tool to identify specific biochemical properties of individual Ras proteins in a clean background. Additionally, major progress has been made in understanding the mechanism underlying Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1). The gene responsible for NF1 encodes a protein that negatively regulates Ras and loss of the gene results in hyperactivation of Ras. The NF1 protein depends on another protein, SPRED1, which is mutated in another familial syndrome called Legius Syndrome.Frank McCormick\u2019s lab is devoted to basic Ras discovery science and focuses on identifying new ways of treating disease driven by Ras proteins.

VArthur McDonald began his studies of fundamental particle interactions during his graduate work at Caltech. His first measurements involved studies in nuclear physics aimed at understanding the underlying particle interactions. These began with studies of Coulomb symmetries in nuclei and continued with studies of parity symmetry in nuclear reactions as a way to isolate the weak interactions between up and down quarks and test the Standard Model of Particle Physics for Z exchange between these quarks. He was one of the founding members of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) international collaboration and became the Director of the project and the Collaboration in 1989. He and his collaborators demonstrated that electron neutrinos from the core of the sun change flavor in transit to Earth, requiring also that they have a finite mass. Both of these properties are beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics and led to the award of the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics, shared with Takaaki Kajita of the SuperKamiokande Collaboration. Professor McDonald continues research at the SNOLAB underground laboratory, working with the DEAP collaboration to search for interactions of Dark Matter particles with 3600 kg of liquid argon. He is also working with the SNO+ collaboration to search for neutrino-less double beta decay, reusing the former SNO detector.Arthur McDonald began his studies of fundamental particle interactions during his graduate work at Caltech.

VI am interested in the science of nanostructures and their applications in physics, materials science, chemistry, biology, and engineering. My group studies the electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of a variety of nanoscale structures ranging from semiconductor quantum dots to single molecules. We have also developed advanced measurement techniques to probe and manipulate molecular-scale systems. I am particularly fascinated by nanoscale forms of carbon, especially graphene sheets and single-walled carbon nanotubes. Our group has probed many fundamental aspects of electron transport in carbon nanotubes, including single electron charging, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and topologically induced spin-orbit coupling. We have also probed the physical and mechanical properties of both nanotubes and graphene. For example, we have shown that a one-atom thick graphene membrane is an impenetrable barrier and can be fashioned into high-performance drumhead resonators. I am currently captivated by the uses of these materials for interfacing to the nanoscale world or as structural elements in a functional nanotechnology.I am interested in the science of nanostructures and their applications in physics, materials science, chemistry, biology, and engineering.

VMy research program has combined training experiences in both organismal and molecular biology to develop two major focuses: 1) host-bacterial symbiosis; and, 2) the 'design' of tissues that interact with light. The experimental strategy for both areas of research relies on methods that have been developed for the study of the squid-vibrio association over the past 25 years. Using this model, my laboratory has explored the most critical questions about the phenomenon of beneficial animal-microbe associations: 1) With each generation, how does the animal harvest the often rare symbiont from the environment upon birth or hatching? 2) How do the host and symbiont recognize one another? 3) How does the bacterial partner influence the developmental program of the host? 4) How is stability achieved and maintained in the mature association? 5) What are the principal differences between how an animal interacts with pathogenic bacterial species and beneficial ones? In addition, I have a continuing interest in the history and development of the field of microbial symbiosis and its impact on biology; a focused effort in this area promises to drive an unprecedented integration across biology as a whole. Such integration will revolutionize the way we think about all aspects of the biosphere.My research program has combined training experiences in both organismal and molecular biology to develop two major focuses: 1) host-bacterial symbiosis; and, 2) the 'design' of tissues that interact with light.

VAs a sociologist, I have spent most of my career studying the causes and consequences of family structure and family stability. I am especially interested in the role of the family in the reproduction of poverty and disadvantage. My early research focused on children of divorced parents. My recent research focuses on children born to unmarried parents. I am a PI of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study which is following a cohort of about 5,000 children born in large US cities between 1998 and 2000. The study has led to several new findings about the lives of unmarried parents and their children, including high levels of father-involvement at birth and high levels of partnership instability and growing sibling complexity after birth. In addition to the original aims of the study, the Fragile Families data have been used by social scientists from a variety of disciplines to study topics of importance to disadvantaged populations, such as the prevalence and consequences of fathers' incarceration, the wellbeing of children born to immigrant parents, and the impact of the "great recession" on low income families. Our research team is currently using the data to examine the interplay between genes and family environments.As a sociologist, I have spent most of my career studying the causes and consequences of family structure and family stability.

VMy main research interests are focused on regulation of immune and inflammatory responses.  Inflammation can be initiated by a variety of noxious conditions, including infections, cellular stress and tissue damage.  We are investigating how these diverse insults are sensed by different types of sentinel cells and how the ensuing inflammatory responses are regulated to optimize host defense.  We address these questions in a broader context of cell communication and regulation of homeostasis.  I am also interested in mechanisms and outcomes of host - microbial interactions, both in the context of overt infections and in the context normal homeostatic interactions with myriads of microbes that colonize our bodies.  The language of host - microbial interactions is only partially deciphered, in that we now understand the basics of how the innate immune system can sense the colonizing microbes through a set of dedicated pattern recognition receptors.  We are now interested in other types of signals involved in host - microbial communication which affect many aspects of host physiology but remain poorly characterized.  Finally, we are interested in physiologic and epigenetic  mechanisms of environmental adaptations and their impact on human diseases.My main research interests are focused on regulation of immune and inflammatory responses.

This research focuses on quantifying the exchanges of greenhouse gases between the land and the atmosphere and on identifying the biotic and abiotic factors affecting these exchanges.

VX.J. Meng\u2019s laboratory focuses on studying the molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and developing effective vaccines against emerging, re-emerging, and zoonotic viral diseases of veterinary and human public health importance. Viruses currently being studied in the Meng\u2019s lab include the hepatitis E viruses (HEV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 (MRV3), and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).

VIn 1974, I conceived a method for sequencing DNA fragments in parallel by cloning, which is the basis for sequencing chromosomes and transcripts of all living organisms. Implementation of this concept required the development of a single-stranded cloning vector, a polycloning site, and a visible detection system for cloned DNA. Parallel sequencing was first applied to whole-genome sequencing with a plant virus as a test case. When oligonucleotide synthesis became automated, we also transferred the cloning system to a plasmid vector, which allowed us to select a high-copy number replicon and use of paired-end sequencing. Because sequencing and engineering of eukaryotic DNA needed biosafety containment, I also developed the JM series of host strains. The cloning system was critical for the early biotechnology industry to express foreign proteins in heterologous cells, as I made it available to everybody without restrictions. This could then be used to develop drugs like Epogen and the first transgenic plants. Because one can separate now single DNA molecules without cloning the concept of parallel sequencing has even become more widely used due to automation and enhanced computing power. My laboratory has used these concepts and reagents to study the dynamics of plant genomes and genes that are critical to our nutrition and food supply.In 1974, I conceived a method for sequencing DNA fragments in parallel by cloning, which is the basis for sequencing chromosomes and transcripts of all living organisms.

VYves Meyer research work sits between pure and applied mathematics. In his PhD thesis (Strasbourg, 1967) Meyer solved a problem raised by Lennart Carleson about strong Ditkin sets. After his PhD, Meyer moved on to number theory, more precisely to Diophantine approximations. This work led to his first major contribution : the theory of model sets, which paved the road to the mathematical theory of quasicrystals. It was later realized that some non-periodic patterns observed in chemical alloys, now generally known as quasicrystals, could be identified with specific model sets. Then in collaboration with Ronald Coifman and Alan McIntosh, Yves Meyer proved the boundedness of the Cauchy kernel on Lipschitz curves, a theorem which was conjectured by Alberto Calderon. Yves Meyer moved on to signal and image processing and, together with Ronald Coifman, Ingrid Daubechies, Alex Grossmann, Stephane Mallat, and Jean Morlet, participated to the wavelet revolution. Later on Yves Meyer launched a research program on the Navier-Stokes equations, in collaboration with his students Lorenzo Brandolese, Marco Cannone, Fabrice Planchon, and Pierre-Gilles Lemarie-Rieusset. Most recently, Yves Meyer has been active in the field of irregular sampling, in collaboration with Basarab Matei and Alexander Olevskii.Yves Meyer research work sits between pure and applied mathematics.

VMy interests focus on evolution and adaptation in the context of microbe-host interactions. Using Bordetella species that colonize respiratory epithelia in humans and other mammals, we are probing the dynamics of global regulatory circuits that control virulence to understand how hierarchical organization facilitates adaptation and host specificity. As the obligate human pathogen  evolved from a -like ancestor, alterations at key nodes in virulence control networks appear to be seminal events in the transition from generalist to human-restricted pathogen. Understanding these adaptations has relevance to pathogenesis and the development of improved vaccines. In a conceptually related project,  species that replicate in eukaryotic cells are providing insight into the evolution of virulence from selective pressures in the rhizosphere. Comparative studies of environmental species with those that occasionally or obligatorily infect mammals reveals a remarkable conservation of virulence mechanisms. We postulate that evasion of predation by environmental phagocytic cells such as amoebae provides the selective pressure for virulence in humans. A vivid example is the ability to fuse membranes by injection of fuseogenic proteins across the surface of infected cells to promote intercellular spread. Finally, we are captivated by diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs), which were discovered in our laboratory. DGRs function to introduce vast amounts of targeted diversity into protein coding sequences by combining site-specific retrotransposition with nucleotide-specific mutagenesis to accelerate the evolution of adaptive traits. DGRs naturally generate libraries of protein variants that are astronomically larger than those attainable by the mammalian immune system or through available biotechnologies. Their adaptive value is illustrated by their broad distribution in Bacterial and Archaeal genomes. Current projects focus on DGRs in pathogens and their horizontal transfer between members of the gastrointestinal microbiome.My interests focus on evolution and adaptation in the context of microbe-host interactions.

Using Bordetella species that colonize respiratory epithelia in humans and other mammals, we are probing the dynamics of global regulatory circuits that control virulence to understand how hierarchical organization facilitates adaptation and host specificity. As the obligate human pathogen  evolved from a -like ancestor, alterations at key nodes in virulence control networks appear to be seminal events in the transition from generalist to human-restricted pathogen. Understanding these adaptations has relevance to pathogenesis and the development of improved vaccines. In a conceptually related project,  species that replicate in eukaryotic cells are providing insight into the evolution of virulence from selective pressures in the rhizosphere. Comparative studies of environmental species with those that occasionally or obligatorily infect mammals reveals a remarkable conservation of virulence mechanisms. We postulate that evasion of predation by environmental phagocytic cells such as amoebae provides the selective pressure for virulence in humans. A vivid example is the ability to fuse membranes by injection of fuseogenic proteins across the surface of infected cells to promote intercellular spread. Finally, we are captivated by diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs), which were discovered in our laboratory. DGRs function to introduce vast amounts of targeted diversity into protein coding sequences by combining site-specific retrotransposition with nucleotide-specific mutagenesis to accelerate the evolution of adaptive traits. DGRs naturally generate libraries of protein variants that are astronomically larger than those attainable by the mammalian immune system or through available biotechnologies.

VI trained as a biochemist at Oxford, than as a Cell Biologist at UCSF. During my PhD work with Marc Kirschner at UCSF I discovered Dynamic Instability of microtubules, a fundamental aspect of cytoskeleton biology, and since then I have studied the biochemistry, dynamics and spatial organization of microtubules and actin filaments, with a focus on cell division mechanisms. Much of my group\u2019s work in this area is based on live fluorescence imaging, and we have been at the forefront of application of novel optical methodologies to living cells. I moved to Harvard Medical School in 1997 to co-direct the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology, a collaboration between chemists and cell biologist to develop and apply small molecule screening capabilities in academia. An early success of this collaboration was Monastrol, a drug that blocks human cells in mitosis by inhibition of an essential Kinesin motor protein. More potent compounds with the same mechanism were developed by industry, and tested in patients as an anti-cancer therapy, starting in 2005. This effort spurred my interest in cancer chemotherapy, and in more rational approaches to drug development in general, that are now major research areas in my group. In 2004 I helped Marc Kirchner found a new department at HMS, Systems Biology, that brings systematic and quantitative methods to bear on problems in basic cell biology and medicine. Systems pharmacology is a major interest area within the department, lead by Peter Sorger, and I play a senior advisor role in that effort.I trained as a biochemist at Oxford, than as a Cell Biologist at UCSF.

VTurbulence in fluids is an important unsolved problem of classical physics with broad applications in engineering ranging from aerodynamics of vehicles to mixing of fuel and oxidizer in combustion chambers. My research has focused on the understanding of the structure and mechanics of turbulence and development of reduced order models for prediction and control of turbulent flows for engineering analysis. I have used large scale numerical simulations as the primary tool in analysis. An appreciable portion of my work has focused on the development of numerical algorithms for computation of turbulent flows and the processing of massive data generated by such computations. Using numerical experiments we have been able to elucidate the fundamental structure of turbulent shear flows, including the minimal flow unit in wall bounded flows. We have combined optimal control and optimization theory with the equations governing fluid flow, and demonstrated that complex turbulent flows can be manipulated for engineering applications such as mitigation of noise or aerodynamic forces. More recently, we have extended our studies to chemically reacting flows and combustion in propulsion systems.Turbulence in fluids is an important unsolved problem of classical physics with broad applications in engineering ranging from aerodynamics of vehicles to mixing of fuel and oxidizer in combustion chambers.

The use of electromagnetic forces and laser radiation to prepare, quantum states of atoms and photons in order to generate controllable interactions and quantum entanglement for studies of quantum many-body systems.(3) Ultrafast Control of Cold Atoms. I am actively pursuing the use of ultrafast (~10-12 s) optical techniques for the manipulation and control of cold atomic systems and the generation of multi-atom entangled quantum states. Ultrafast control eliminates sensitivity to slower decoherence processes, and represents a new regime of ultracold atomic physics.(4) Education and Foundations of Quantum Mechanics. Interest in the general phenomenon of quantum measurement and quantum entanglement used for quantum metrology and the border between quantum and classical physics. Conveying quantum tenets to nonscientists, with heavy reliance on analogies from the visual and musical arts.

VWnts are a family of secreted proteins that activate receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways, leading to modulation of cell proliferation, cell fate, cell behavior, and the self-renewal of stem cells. Constitutive activation of the pathway via mutations is linked to cancer, while attenuated signaling is linked to neurodegenerative disease, bone density disease, and other conditions. Our lab focuses on three goals: identifying the normal roles of Wnt signaling in embryos and adults, dissecting the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which this signaling occurs, and leveraging this knowledge to develop therapies for acute and chronic medical conditions that involve aberrant Wnt signaling.Wnts are a family of secreted proteins that activate receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways, leading to modulation of cell proliferation, cell fate, cell behavior, and the self-renewal of stem cells.

VOur laboratory (a joint effort with Yuan Chang (section 44)) is devoted to finding new human tumor viruses and using these viruses as tools to understand basic cancer cell biology. This research began with discovery of the herpesvirus causing Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus 8) in 1994 using a DNA subtraction method. In 2008, we discovered a second tumor virus, a polyomavirus, causing most cases of Merkel cell carcinoma. Examining the genes encoded by these viruses allowed us to explore the roles of innate immunity in controlling cancer cell proliferation and viral infection. More recently, we have begun examining how viruses usurp the translational machinery of the cell, which might also contribute to tumor cell growth.Our laboratory (a joint effort with Yuan Chang (section 44)) is devoted to finding new human tumor viruses and using these viruses as tools to understand basic cancer cell biology.

VOver the past 30 years, I have addressed a number of issues of human-environmental interest: how Amazonian soils vary from place to place and the challenge this presents to management; how environmental constraints relate to human physiological, cultural, and behavioral responses; how the demographic structure of households affects their land use including deforestation decisions; how spatial and temporal scale impacts social and environmental explanations; and perhaps most significantly how integrative studies of human-environment relations may be designed, executed, and result in more satisfactory explanations of complex human-environmental systems. Unlike most studies, I have not only collected information of the local systems of knowledge but validated this knowledge through taking soil samples and having them analyzed in order to evaluate the accuracy of local knowledge and under what conditions that knowledge may be limited (and why). This work demonstrated the significance of soils fertility to the rates of secondary forest regrowth after deforestation in Amazonia. In my first book, Human Adaptability (3 editions) I undertook the task of integrating the findings of the biophysical sciences coming from the International Biological Program (IBP) with the findings of the social sciences and human biology. The book is widely used still because of its successful integration of biophysical environmental research, studies of human physiological adaptation, and behavioral and cultural research from a variety of disciplines to understand how people interact with the physical environment and the impact of environment on human possibilities. Following 18 years of research and a Guggenheim Fellowship, the book, Through Amazonian Eyes: the human ecology of Amazonian populations (1993) carried out an integrative approach to the study of the Amazonian environment and its peoples never before attempted. It made a number of new contributions to science: it demonstrated that the Amazon region, until then routinely divided into upland forest and floodplain, was made up of many more complex ecosystems whose characteristics resulted in very different constraints and opportunities for human populations and provided an agenda for integrative research on human-environment in that region. In this past decade, I would characterize my contribution as conceptualizing, developing methods, and carrying out analyses distinguished by an integrative vision of an emerging meta-discipline that I have tried to help construct, variously called environmental social science or human-environmental science. My latest book, Environmental Social Science (Wiley/Blackwell 2010) reflects these interests.Over the past 30 years, I have addressed a number of issues of human-environmental interest: how Amazonian soils vary from place to place and the challenge this presents to management; how environmental constraints relate to human physiological, cultural, and behavioral responses; how the demographic structure of households affects their land use including deforestation decisions; how spatial and temporal scale impacts social and environmental explanations; and perhaps most significantly how integrative studies of human-environment relations may be designed, executed, and result in more satisfactory explanations of complex human-environmental systems.

VShigefumi Mori started working in algebraic geometry especially from the viewpoint of how a manifold is curved globally around 1980. His first remarkable work called "Bend-and-Break" in this direction was the existence of a rational curve on a manifold under a mild positive curvature hypothesis, which he applied to settle conjectures characterizing projective spaces in terms of global positive curvature conditions. As a further generalization he created the theory of extremal rays, which brought a new curvature viewpoint to the Hironaka-Kleiman cone of curves. It initiated the so-called Minimal Model Program which intends to transform an algebraic variety into a minimal model, i.e. a weakly non-positively curved one, or a Fano fiber space, i.e. a fiber space which is weakly positively curved over the base, in oversimplified terms. He completed the three dimensional case of the program by proving its last missing step. It was the starting point of the Minimal Model Program currently available in many cases in all dimensions, which is now a fundamental tool to study algebraic varieties.Shigefumi Mori started working in algebraic geometry especially from the viewpoint of how a manifold is curved globally around 1980.

It initiated the so-called Minimal Model Program which intends to transform an algebraic variety into a minimal model, i.e. a weakly non-positively curved one, or a Fano fiber space, i.e. a fiber space which is weakly positively curved over the base, in oversimplified terms. He completed the three dimensional case of the program by proving its last missing step. It was the starting point of the Minimal Model Program currently available in many cases in all dimensions, which is now a fundamental tool to study algebraic varieties.Shigefumi Mori started working in algebraic geometry especially from the viewpoint of how a manifold is curved globally around 1980.

VShigefumi Mori is a mathematician recognized for his work on algebraic geometry. He is known particularly for his theory of extremal rays in higher dimensional birational geometry that works as an important marker for a geometric structure of an algebraic variety. It is a basis for various classification theory of algebraic varieties and the so-called Minimal Model Program, which intends to transform an algebraic variety into one with a simpler global structure and essentially reduce the study of an algebraic variety to those of two simpler opposite classes called minimal models and Fano varieties. Mori was born in Nagoya City, Japan. He obtained B. Sc. in 1973 and D. Sc. in 1978 both from Kyoto University, Japan. He served as Assistant at Kyoto University, Lecturer and Professor at Nagoya University, Professor at Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences of Kyoto University, and since 2016 he has been Distinguished Professor and Director-General of Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study. He also stayed at several institutions including Harvard University, Institute for Advanced Study Princeton, Columbia University, and University of Utah.

VI am interested in neural network computations in the cortex, with particular emphasis on dynamic representation of space and memory in the hippocampal-entorhinal system. I have studied how spatial location and spatial memory are computed in the brain. My most noteworthy contribution is the discovery of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, which points to the entorhinal cortex as a hub for the brain network that makes us find our way. Together with many colleagues, and in particular my long-term collaborator May-Britt Moser, I have shown how a variety of functional cell types in the entorhinal microcircuit contribute to representation of self-location and how the outputs of this circuit are used by memory networks in the hippocampus. We have shown that the grid-cell network is organized in modules and we have found parts of the mechanisms for the interaction between grid cells and geometrical features of the local environment. The discovery of grid cells and their control of population dynamics in the hippocampus have led to a revision of established views of how the brain calculates self-position and spatial mapping and is becoming one of the first non-sensory cognitive functions to be characterized at a mechanistic level in neuronal networks.I am interested in neural network computations in the cortex, with particular emphasis on dynamic representation of space and memory in the hippocampal-entorhinal system.

VThe focus of my work is on the neurobiology of learning and spatial representation, with a particular emphasis on the function of cortico-hippocampal subregions. Throughout my scientific career I have focused my research on spatial navigation and memory. Most of my research has been performed in collaboration with my long-term collaborator Edvard Moser. With the combination of advanced inactivation techniques, anatomical approaches and recording methods, our efforts have resulted in several discoveries. The most spectacular finding was probably the discovery of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. The discovery of grid cells was succeeded by the identification of other functional cell types, including head direction cells, border cells and speed cells. Collectively the findings point to the entorhinal cortex as a hub for the brain network that makes us find our way. In combination with the place cells of the hippocampus, the entorhinal network may provide a \u2018coordinate system\u2019 for on-line measurement of distance and direction within given constellations of landmarks.

VMy research is centered on the mechanisms of development of immune cell lineages. My initial work focused on the processes underlying the plasticity of CD4 T cell responses that adapt to defeat distinct types of pathogens. My laboratory developed systems to track clonal responses under physiologic settings in vitro to allow identification of cytokines, receptors and transcription factors controlling T cell fate choice into diverse phenotypes. We identified the mechanisms that instruct T cell fates, and that act to stabilize these fates or their promote plasticity. Subsequent work focused on how the immune system selects the appropriate instructive signal to induce T cell fates that are appropriately matched to different pathogens. We identified the molecular and genetic basis of distinct classes of dendritic cells that coordinate the detection of and proper instruction to distinct categories of pathogens. Our current work is aimed at defining the precise mechanisms of progenitor diversification that generate this repertoire of dendritic cells.My research is centered on the mechanisms of development of immune cell lineages.

VWe try to understand the \u201crules of the game\u201d that explain how cells function and evolve. We study budding yeast, using experimental evolution, genetic analysis, synthetic biology, and cell biology. We try to make quantitative measurements that discriminate amongst different classes of models. How does biological novelty evolve? This process is difficult to study in nature, and we therefore apply selective pressure in the laboratory. We have evolved multicellularity, altered mating preferences, circadian oscillators, genetic instability, and new connections between signaling pathways and have developed methods to find the mutations that cause these new phenotypes. We are interested both in general questions about what determines evolutionary trajectories and the specific mechanisms that organisms invent to produce novel traits. We investigate how cells accomplish specific tasks by engineering and analyzing the behavior of new yeast strains. As examples, we have used synthetic biology to support the notions that the efficient use of secreted public goods drove the evolution of multicellularity, that multicellularity arose before cellular differentiation, and that novel symbioses could arise without requiring previous evolutionary co-adaptation. How do cells respond and adapt to their environment to maximize the chance that they survive and reproduce? Achieving these aims requires the coordination of thousands of reactions under a wide range of inter- and extracellular conditions.

VApoptosis is a term coined by Wyllie and his associates in 1972 to distinguish a morphologically distinct form of cell death. The molecular mechanism and physiological roles of apoptosis had been elusive for a long time due to few experimental systems to study this process. Nagata\u2019s laboratory identified a receptor (Fas) and its ligand (Fas ligand) that mediate apoptotic cell death, and showed that loss-of function mutations of Fas and Fas ligand accelerate autoimmune diseases, accompanied by lymphoproliferation. The exaggeration of Fas-mediated apoptosis was shown to cause the tissue destruction. Nagata\u2019s group then showed that when cells undergo apoptosis, a cascade of caspases is activated, and the caspases in the downstream of the cascade activate a specific DNase to cause DNA fragmentation. They also showed that the caspase-mediated cleavage inactivates a flippase responsible for maintaining the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids at plasma membrane. While, caspase activates a scramblase that scrambles phospholipids at plasma membrane, thus exposing phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to the cell surface. These features, the DNA fragmentation and PtdSer-exposure are major characteristics of apoptosis. Apoptotic cells are swiftly engulfed by macrophages to prevent the release of noxious materials from dead cells. Nagata\u2019s group identified factors expressed in macrophages that recognize PtdSer exposed on apoptotic cells, and promote the engulfment of apoptotic cells.Apoptosis is a term coined by Wyllie and his associates in 1972 to distinguish a morphologically distinct form of cell death.

These features, the DNA fragmentation and PtdSer-exposure are major characteristics of apoptosis. Apoptotic cells are swiftly engulfed by macrophages to prevent the release of noxious materials from dead cells. Nagata\u2019s group identified factors expressed in macrophages that recognize PtdSer exposed on apoptotic cells, and promote the engulfment of apoptotic cells.Apoptosis is a term coined by Wyllie and his associates in 1972 to distinguish a morphologically distinct form of cell death. The molecular mechanism and physiological roles of apoptosis had been elusive for a long time due to few experimental systems to study this process. Nagata\u2019s laboratory identified a receptor (Fas) and its ligand (Fas ligand) that mediate apoptotic cell death, and showed that loss-of function mutations of Fas and Fas ligand accelerate autoimmune diseases, accompanied by lymphoproliferation. The exaggeration of Fas-mediated apoptosis was shown to cause the tissue destruction. Nagata\u2019s group then showed that when cells undergo apoptosis, a cascade of caspases is activated, and the caspases in the downstream of the cascade activate a specific DNase to cause DNA fragmentation. They also showed that the caspase-mediated cleavage inactivates a flippase responsible for maintaining the asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids at plasma membrane. While, caspase activates a scramblase that scrambles phospholipids at plasma membrane, thus exposing phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to the cell surface.

VMy research deals with the basis of host defense at immunological and biochemical levels and the implications for therapy. Over four decades I established that lymphocyte products activate macrophages, that interferon-gamma is a major macrophage activating factor (which I helped introduce into clinical use), and that mechanisms of macrophage antimicrobial activity include induction of the respiratory burst and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). My colleagues and I purified, cloned, knocked out and characterized iNOS biochemically and functionally, discovered the cofactor role of tetrahydrobiopterin in NOS's and introduced iNOS as a potential target in diseases such as Alzheimer's. Although iNOS helps the host control Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the leading cause of death from bacterial infection, Mtb resists sterilization by host immunity. We are now studying the biochemical basis of Mtb's persistence. Genetic and chemical screens have identified enzymes that Mtb requires to survive during non-replicative persistence, including the proteasome, a serine protease that controls intrabacterial pH and components of pyruvate dehydrogenase that also serve in peroxynitrite reductase. We are identifying compounds that kill non-replicating bacteria and using this as an opportunity to test new collaborative models between academia and industry.My research deals with the basis of host defense at immunological and biochemical levels and the implications for therapy.

VOver the course of this research she has observed that different brain systems and related functions display markedly different degrees or 'profiles' of neuroplasticity. Some systems appear quite strongly determined and are not altered even when experience has been very different. Other systems are highly modifiable by experience and are dependent on experience but only during particular time periods ("sensitive periods"). There are several different sensitive periods, even within a domain of processing. A third 'plasticity profile' is demonstrated by those neural systems that remain capable of change by experience throughout life. Guided by these findings, she is conducting a program of research on the effects of different types of training on brain development and cognition in typically developing children of different ages. One study targets the most changeable and vulnerable systems in 3-5 year old preschoolers (at-risk for school failure for reasons of poverty) whom are studied before and after the children receive 8 weeks of attention training and parents receive training in parenting skills once a week.

Current areas of interest include the biosynthesis and function of photosynthetic pigments, assembly of photosynthetic reaction centers, structure and dynamics of the photosynthetic membrane, mechanisms involved in sensing excess light, and regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting in saturating light. By comparing how photosynthesis works in diverse organisms, they hope to uncover general design principles of natural photosynthesis as well as unique adaptations to different environments.

VCarlos Nobre\u2019s research group is interested in biosphere-atmosphere interactions, especially in the Amazon, and has carried out observational and modeling studies on the responses of the climate system to land use change in the Amazon, and, conversely, how climate change may affect tropical ecosystems. They have carried out observational studies as part of international biosphere-atmosphere experiments in the Amazon (e.g., the Amazonian Micrometeorological Experiments (ARME), the Global Tropospheric Experiment-Amazon Boundary Layer Experiment (GTE-ABLA), the Anglo-Brazilian Climate Observations Study (ABRACOS) and the Large Scale Atmosphere-Biosphere Experiment in the Amazon-LBA) to demonstrated that large scale deforestation increases surface temperature, decreases dry season evapotranspiration and may reduce precipitation and lengthen dry season. The predicted lengthening of the dry season is particularly relevant because it determines the vegetation type: short dry season leads to tropical forests; longer than 4 months dry season leads to tropical savannas. To understand the role of the forest for climate, they used a suite of climate system models, including representations of the vegetation and the land vegetation carbon cycle. They simulated large scale deforestation in the models and showed that a probable reduction of dry season rainfall would lead to a tropical savanna-like vegetation in southern and southeastern Amazon, which led to the formulation in 1991 to the hypothesis of Amazon \u2018savannization\u2019, a topic that has received considerable attention since then. Later they proposed that the biosphere-atmosphere system in the Amazon has two stable equilibrium states: the current one with tropical forest and a second one with forests and savannas. They have studied the stability properties of these equilibrium states and proposed \u2018tipping\u2019 points that should not be transgressed for maintenance of the forest: 3.5°C of global warming or 40% of total deforested area in the Amazon basin. They also examined the role of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the tropical forest with models since, in principle, the water efficiency of vegetation increases with elevated CO2, and it is a factor to heighten forest\u2019s resilience to climate change. They concluded that \u2018CO2-fertilization effect\u2019 could perhaps delay savannization, but not rule it out. They also showed that lightning induced vegetation fire has been a key player in setting the forest-savanna boundary in southern Amazon over vegetation succession time scales (decades to millennia). It the absence of that natural fire ignition mechanism, the forest-savanna boundary would be several hundred km to the south of their actual position. They also show that the observed 3-10 times increase of man-made forest fire frequency may accelerate the trend towards savannization of the Amazon because increases forest vulnerability, whereas fire is part of tropical savanna ecology. They also studied scenarios of future climate change in the Amazon with the indication of enhanced climate extremes, both droughts and floods. They showed that the there is an observed increased in the frequency of extreme droughts and floods in the Amazon since 2005 and the most likely explanation is an early manifestation of climate change.Carlos Nobre\u2019s research group is interested in biosphere-atmosphere interactions, especially in the Amazon, and has carried out observational and modeling studies on the responses of the climate system to land use change in the Amazon, and, conversely, how climate change may affect tropical ecosystems.

VEva Nogales's lab is dedicated to gaining mechanistic insight into two important areas of eukaryotic biology: central dogma machinery in the control of gene expression, and cytoskeleton interactions and dynamics in cell division. To gain a molecular understanding of their systems of interest, her lab uses state-of-the-art cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image analysis, as well as biochemical and biophysical assays. Her studies of tubulin and microtubules have shed unique light on the mechanism of microtubule dynamic instability by establishing the structural basis of nucleotide exchange, polymerization-coupled hydrolysis, hydrolysis-induced conformational changes in microtubule structure, taxol binding and stabilization, and the recognition and effect of EB proteins on microtubules. Her lab has also characterized the binding to and self-assembly of Dam1 and Ndc80 kinetochores complexes onto microtubules. Her lab has also contribute significant mechanistic understanding of the eukaryotic transcription initiation process by defining the structure of TFIID and its rearrangement to engage core promoter DNA, and the assembly and structure of the full human transcription preinitiation complex. Additional work from her lab includes the structures of the eukaryotic proteosome, the polycomb repressive complex 2, or a number of CRISPR/Cas complexes and their interaction with target DNA/RNA.Eva Nogales's lab is dedicated to gaining mechanistic insight into two important areas of eukaryotic biology: central dogma machinery in the control of gene expression, and cytoskeleton interactions and dynamics in cell division.

VI am interested in understanding how intercellular signals control embryogenesis and organogenesis. From our work and that of many others, it has emerged that molecules of the Wnt family regulate numerous decisions that cells make during embryogenesis. It is now also clear that Wnt signals influence how stem cells divide. Unrestrained Wnt signaling, after mutations in Wnt signaling components, is implicated in cancer, including human colon cancer. Currently, my research focuses on how Wnt sigals influence stem cell self-renewal, using in vitro approaches based on Wnt protein activity. We also use strains of mice in which Wnt signaling can be visualized and Wnt target cells can be traced. This line of work is being extended into trying to understand how tissues respond to injury, and how regeneration is being initiated.I am interested in understanding how intercellular signals control embryogenesis and organogenesis.

VPatrick O\u2019Farrell began his career wanting to understand the \u201cmiracle\u201d of embryonic development. He chose to use genetics as his guide and Drosophila as the experimental organism. His laboratory participated in a revolutionary decade in developmental biology. In the 1980s the genes governing patterning were discovered, cloned and the circuitry of their regulation defined. His laboratory demonstrated that the homeotic class of regulatory proteins are DNA binding proteins and regulators of transcription, and they detailed aspects of the circuitry subdividing the embryo. At the close of this period, the O\u2019Farrell lab sought to understand how these genes governed morphogenesis. They identified numerous regulators of cell cycle progression, and showed how patterning genes regulated these cell cycle genes to guide embryonic cell proliferation. Current work seeks to define the timer or clock that paces early development and coordinates cell cycle progression with onset of regulated transcription. A recent fascination in the potential of genetic conflicts to disrupt biological order has led to a new effort. To explore such conflicts, the lab developed tools to analyze mitochondrial genetics. They have uncovered sophisticated nuclear programs that oversee the potentially unruly behavior of the mitochondrial genome.Patrick O\u2019Farrell began his career wanting to understand the \u201cmiracle\u201d of embryonic development.

VO\u2019Keefe is interested in the role of the hippocampal formation in spatial memory and navigation. In 1971, he discovered that the rat hippocampus contained cells which selectively signal an animal\u2019s spatial location.  The discovery of \u2018place cells\u2019 suggested that this part of the brain might function as a cognitive map, a notion developed extensively by himself and Nadel in a book published in 1978 (). In 1993, his lab reported that, in addition to the place cell firing rate, the code for location was based on the timing of spikes referenced to the 7-11 Hz hippocampal theta rhythm. This is one of the best examples in neuroscience of the use of the timing of action potentials to represent information. Recently, he and colleagues have studied the properties of the entorhinal cortical grid cells one of the major inputs to the hippocampus. With their beautiful hexagonal symmetry, many believe them ideally suited to provide the metric for the cognitive map although other spatial functions are also possible.O\u2019Keefe is interested in the role of the hippocampal formation in spatial memory and navigation.

VUnderstanding how evolution has led to the remarkable diversity of life is the key motivating force behind Otto's research. Mathematical models allow her to determine which evolutionary transitions are plausible, which are probable, and which are inaccessible. Otto and her students have developed core evolutionary theory for understanding transitions among modes of reproduction, mating systems, and ploidy levels. For example, sexual reproduction is widespread in nature but the reason has puzzled biologists for over a century. By developing new stochastic methods, Otto has demonstrated that the constraints of evolution acting on a limited number of individuals provide a strong and robust advantage to sexual reproduction, which was not seen in previous deterministic models. Otto and colleagues have also developed likelihood-based approaches to infer how speciation and extinction rates depend on particular traits across phylogenies. To 'ground truth' evolutionary theory, her group performs experiments using different plant systems and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For example, her research with yeast has explored how the number of copies of genomes within each cell ("ploidy level") influences adaptation and mutation accumulation. Current research investigates the nature and scope of beneficial mutations acquired in stressful environments and the trade-offs they exhibit to better understand the constraints on evolutionary adaptation.Understanding how evolution has led to the remarkable diversity of life is the key motivating force behind Otto's research.

VAriel0s research has focused on developing methodology that enables empirical analysis of the market responses to environmental and policy changes (e.g. mergers, tari changes, factor price changes...). This includes; i) the estimation of demand systems that are capable of analyzing the impact of these changes on prices and the demand for new products, ii) developing methods capable of assessing the impact of such changes on productivity, and iii) developing models that enables the analssis of the impacts of these changes on investments and hence the evolution of markets over time. This required an the development of certain econometric and theoretical tools. Currently he is working on estimators for problems involving moment inequalities and on empirically useable theoretical and computational tools for analyzing dynamic games. In the past Ariel applied these tools to the analysis of the auto, health care, and telecommunications equipment industries. He currently focuses on the health care industry. Ariel has analyzed the impact of different incentive schemes for doctors on hospital allocations and is now analyzing the impact of changes in the structure of the health care industry on the quality and cost of health care. Ariel has a related interest in appropriate construction of price indices. He has developed techniques for constructing a more accurate Consumer Price Index, and is currently investigating how we would construct an index that emanates from contractarian thought and covers the cost of what society views as necessities.Ariel0s research has focused on developing methodology that enables empirical analysis of the market responses to environmental and policy changes (e.g. mergers, tari changes, factor price changes...).

VMy laboratory studies the signaling pathways that control vertebrate neural development and that go awry in tumorigenesis. One focus has been the Trk family of transmembrane RTK receptors for the neurotrophin ligands. Using knockout mutations in mice for the genes encoding the neurotrophins: BDNF, NT3, and NT4/5, as well as the TrkA and TrkB receptors, we studied the essential nature of the neurotrophins and their receptors in the survival of early neurons and more complex phenotypes in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Conditional knockout technology allowed for more precise analysis of neurotrophin function in the CNS, demonstrating a role in development, synaptic plasticity and behavior. These models also proved useful for studying neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, and we are currently investigating the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in antidepressant response.My laboratory studies the signaling pathways that control vertebrate neural development and that go awry in tumorigenesis.

These patterns include deltas, continental shelves, dendritic drainage networks, river meandering and braiding, submarine canyons, patterns of sediment sorting, cyclic steps in alluvial and bedrock rivers, as well as the deep sea, dispersal of tracer stones, formation of channel-floodplain complexes, deep-sea minibasin sedimentation and turbidity current dynamics. Applications include delta rehabilitation, design of mine waste disposal plans, reservoir sedimentation, riverbank protection, restoration of streams for salmonid spawning, dam removal and floodwater extraction. Parker\u2019s tools are primarily theoretical, numerical and experimental. He partners with experts in field research to add this essential component.

He works with theoretical, numerical and experimental techniques to explain such problems as why and how rivers meander, how rivers self-construct their own channels, how rivers sort sediment, how turbidity currents run out long distances in the ocean and how they excavate submarine canyons. Parker\u2019s interest in sediment transport in rivers was sparked by a class on the subject taught by Prof. L Brush of Johns Hopkins University in 1971. In 1972, Dr. Alvin Anderson offered him the chance to perform doctoral research on river meandering at the University of Minnesota. At the same university, Dr. Roger Hooke of the Department of Geology introduced him to supraglacial meltwater meandering. Parker was first a faculty member at the University of Alberta, Canada (5 years), and then at the University of Minnesota (25 years).

VClaire Parkinson\u2019s research is centered on polar sea ice and its connections to the rest of the climate system and to climate change, especially as revealed through satellite observations. With her colleagues, she has generated sea ice data sets from a sequence of satellite passive-microwave instruments, has intercalibrated the overlapping data sets to merge them into long-term climate data records, and has used these records to examine the regional and interannual variabilities of the polar sea ice covers and to determine and quantify long-term trends, including decreases in Arctic sea-ice coverage and increases in Antarctic sea-ice coverage since the 1970s. Parkinson has additionally calculated and analyzed the length of the sea ice season and its trends on a pixel-by-pixel basis and has developed a computer model of sea ice and used it in various studies, including to examine the unusual open-water feature named the Weddell Polynya. She has written books on satellite Earth observations, climate change, and the history of science and has co-written/co-edited books on sea ice, climate modeling, satellite data, and the careers of women at Goddard Space Flight Center. In a 2010 book, she reviews the long history of climate change and raises concerns regarding potentially dangerous geoengineering proposals.Claire Parkinson\u2019s research is centered on polar sea ice and its connections to the rest of the climate system and to climate change, especially as revealed through satellite observations.

VArdem Patapoutian\u2019s laboratory is interested in how we perceive physical stimuli such as temperature and pressure. The Patapoutian lab has identified and characterized molecules responsible for sensing environmental temperature. These proteins are ion channels that are activated by distinct changes in thermal energy (in the noxious to innocuous range), thus functioning as the molecular thermometers of our body. A subset of these same ion channels also act as polymodal chemosensors, and play an essential role in pain and inflammation. Mechanotransduction is perhaps the last sensory modality not understood at the molecular level. Proteins that sense mechanical force play critical roles in sensing touch/pain (somatosensation), sound (hearing), shear stress (cardiovascular tone), etc.; however, the identity of ion channels involved in sensing mechanical force had remained elusive. The Patapoutian lab identified Piezo1 and Piezo2, mechanically-activated cation channels that are expressed in many mechanosensitive cell types. Genetic studies established that Piezo2 is the principal mechanical transducer for touch, proprioception, and lung stretch, and that Piezo1 mediates blood-flow sensing, which impacts blood pressure regulation and vascular development. Additionally, the Patapoutian lab co-identified SWELL1 (LRRC8A), an ion channel critical for regulating cell volume in response to osmotic shock. Clinical investigations have confirmed the importance of these channels in human physiology. The lab continues to analyze the physiological relevance of these ion channels in mechanosensation, and to search for novel mechanosensors.Ardem Patapoutian\u2019s laboratory is interested in how we perceive physical stimuli such as temperature and pressure.

X-ray lasers in the Angstrom region using population inversion in the inner atomic levels are not possible because of their short lifetime. Pellegrini proposed an alternative approach using free-electron lasers (FELs) based on self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). He lead the work to establish the theoretical foundation of X-ray SASE FELs and the experimental work at UCLA demonstrating for the first time the validity of the theoretical models, measuring very large gain and the statistical properties of the radiation. His work lead to the development of X-ray FELs in the USA and worldwide, opening for the first time the exploration of atomic and molecular science at the simultaneous Angstrom-femtosecond space and time resolution. X-ray FELs are producing breakthrough new science in chemistry, physics and biology.

His work lead to the development of X-ray FELs in the USA and worldwide, opening for the first time the exploration of atomic and molecular science at the simultaneous Angstrom-femtosecond space and time resolution. X-ray FELs are producing breakthrough new science in chemistry, physics and biology. He is continuing his work to extend the capabilities of X-ray FELs to ultra-high peak power and attosecond pulse duration.Claudio Pellegrini is mainly interested in multi body, collective and self-organization phenomena in particle beams and their applications to particle colliders for high energy physics and the generation of coherent X-ray radiation with free-electron lasers. X-ray lasers in the Angstrom region using population inversion in the inner atomic levels are not possible because of their short lifetime.

VMy research in the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham density-functional theory of electronic structure has helped to establish this theory as the most widely-used method to predict the properties of atoms, molecules, and solids from the principles of quantum mechanics. A density functional is a formula that expresses the energy of a many-electron system in terms of its electron density, facilitating the easy computer calculation of both. I and my collaborators have discovered some unexpected properties of the exact density functional, including its derivative discontinuity and scaling properties. We have also constructed a ladder of nonempirical approximations to the exact functional, on which higher rungs are more complex and more accurate. In essence, we have been making educated guesses at the rule for "nature's glue" that binds electrons into atoms and atoms into molecules and solids. We seek functionals that are rooted in physical principles and work reliably for atoms, molecules, solids, surfaces, and molecules on surfaces. Our functionals are built into standard computer codes, and are widely used by both physicists and chemists.My research in the Hohenberg-Kohn-Sham density-functional theory of electronic structure has helped to establish this theory as the most widely-used method to predict the properties of atoms, molecules, and solids from the principles of quantum mechanics.

VChristine Petit\u2019s laboratory is interested in the hair bundle and auditory hair cell synapse functioning. Through a genetic approach based on the identification of genes causing early-onset forms of sensorineural deafness in humans and interdisciplinary studies of relevant mouse mutants, Christine Petit and her colleagues have revealed dynamic networks of adhesive and cytoskeletal proteins (such as the protein complexes encoded by Usher syndrome genes) essential for hair-bundle development and the mechanotransduction operated by this structure. They have determined the molecular composition of the various fibrous links of the hair bundle and elucidated the key roles they play in hair bundle morphogenesis and sound processing. Based on these findings they are currently investigating the essential functions some of these adhesion links ensure in the photoreceptor cells. They have shown that the hair cell ribbon synapse is endowed with a unique molecular exocytosis machinery, which underlies its specific physiological properties. They have found a general mechanism protecting the auditory system against damage due to overexposure to noise, namely an adaptive proliferation of peroxisomes. Their new research topics focus on the auditory cortex dysfunctions associated with early-onset cochlear defects and therapeutic interventions for hearing impairment.Christine Petit\u2019s laboratory is interested in the hair bundle and auditory hair cell synapse functioning.

VJohn Pickett studies the chemical ecology of interactions between insects, some other animals, and between insects, plants and animal hosts. This specifically involves the chemical characterisation of molecular structures of natural products that influence the development or behaviour (semiochemicals) of insects and the other organisms. He was the first to identify aphid, mosquito and sandfly pheromones. Research extends to the biochemistry and molecular biology of secondary plant metabolites that act as semiochemicals and the mechanisms by which they are employed and perceived by insects. The long term objectives are to develop pheromones and other semiochemicals for new methods of pest control. This is exemplified particularly by his work in Africa using companion crops to deliver plant secondary metabolites for pest and weed management and new approaches for using genetic modification of crop plants to release protective semiochemicals. His studies also involve devising novel ways of controlling vectors of pathogens attacking the human population and farm animals.John Pickett studies the chemical ecology of interactions between insects, some other animals, and between insects, plants and animal hosts.

VCraig Pikaard's laboratory is interested in how specific genes are targeted for silencing. One focus is the selective silencing of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, which are genes encoding RNAs needed for the assembly and function of ribosomes, the protein-synthesizing machines of cells. Eukaryotes have hundreds of rRNA genes that are nearly identical in sequence. During early development, virtually all rRNA genes are active. However, later in development, only a subset of rRNA is active. Pikaard's lab has shown that the non-expressed genes are inactivated by DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications, with the choice of which genes to silence somehow dictated by the chromosomal positions of the genes, and not their sequences. Studies to understand the molecular basis for the choice mechanism are ongoing. A second focus of the lab is to understand the roles of nuclear multisubunit RNA polymerases IV and V in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), a process needed to silence transposable elements as well as a subset of genes. Using a combination of biochemical assays conducted in vitro and genetic and genomic experiments in vivo, Pikaard's lab is working to understand how Pol IV and Pol V transcription is initiated, terminated and coupled with the activities of other enzymes in the RdDM pathway.Craig Pikaard's laboratory is interested in how specific genes are targeted for silencing.

VSteven Pinker has conducted experimental and theoretical research on a diverse range of topics in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. His experiments in visual cognition showed how imagery, attention, and shape recognition are both three-dimensional and specific to a vantage point. He developed the first comprehensive theory of language acquisition in children, and investigated how they learn the meanings and syntax of verbs and the regular and irregular forms of plurals and past tenses. He used the latter phenomenon to probe the limits of neural network models of language, and the interaction between memory and computation in language processing and change. He helped launch the modern study of language evolution, and has recently used evolutionary models to illuminate innuendo, emotional expression, and social coordination. In analyses of datasets on violence he documented surprising historical declines in every form of aggression, and explained them with a combination of psychology, neuroscience, political science, and history, in which distinct violent motives and peaceable motives interact in specific ways in different contexts and eras. He has also investigated how research in linguistics and cognitive science can lead to effective advice on clear writing.Steven Pinker has conducted experimental and theoretical research on a diverse range of topics in cognitive science and evolutionary psychology.

VHidde Ploegh\u2019s laboratory is interested in the biochemistry of immune recognition, and in mechanisms by which pathogens avoid being seen by the immune system. His earlier work centered on the analysis of the biochemical pathways involved in antigen processing and presentation by the products of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), which led to studies into glycoprotein biosynthesis and trafficking more generally. The discovery that human cytomegalovirus exploits an unusual mechanism to dispose of Class I MHC products, critical for recognition by cytotoxic T cells of virus-infected cells, led to observations that illuminated new aspects of glycoprotein quality control. Ploegh has applied chemistry to develop activity-based probes to study proteasomal proteolysis and more specifically the role of ubiquitin-specific proteases, also in the context of herpesvirus infections. More recently Ploegh has combined the generation of camelid-derived antibody fragments with a protein engineering approach, based on the use of bacterial sortases in conjunction with peptide chemistry. This combination is being developed to enable the visualization, by non-invasive means, of anti-tumor and anti-virus immune responses using positron emission tomography.Hidde Ploegh\u2019s laboratory is interested in the biochemistry of immune recognition, and in mechanisms by which pathogens avoid being seen by the immune system.

VPlants undergo several major transitions during their post-­embryonic development. Scott Poethig\u2019s laboratory is primarily interested in the first of these transitions, known as vegetative phase change. This transition is marked by changes in a large number of vegetative traits, such as leaf shape and branching patterns, and occurs in all vascular plants. Working first with maize and later with Arabidiopsis, the Poethig laboratory found that vegetative phase change is controlled by a decrease in the expression the evolutionarily conserved microRNAs, miR156/157, resulting in the expression of their targets, SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING (SBP/SPL) transcription factors. They are currently studying the factors responsible for the temporal expression pattern of miR156/157, the mechanism by which these miRNAs repress SBP/SPL gene expression, and the role of miR156/157 in the evolution of shoot morphology in trees.Plants undergo several major transitions during their post-­embryonic development.

VMy research integrates ecology and economics to analyze the spatial pattern and value of ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and other objectives that affect human well-being, and analyzes how these objectives are impacted by various human decisions on land use, resource use, energy production, and food production. This research incorporates how human actions affect ecosystems, the effect that changes in ecosystem structure and function have on the provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity, the values of these services in terms of changes in human well-being, and the impact of various policies and incentive mechanisms that can influence decisions.  The aim of this research is to accurately measure the consequences of alternative decisions and to link these measures to incentives to provide better decisions and improved outcomes. I have applied similar integrated ecological and economic analysis to assess the full-cost of production and use of biofuels versus conventional fossil-fuels that includes the costs of greenhouse gas emissions and emissions leading to air and water pollution, setting conservation priorities by calculating a return on investment that maximizes biodiversity conservation per dollar spent on conservation, the relative effectiveness of alternative environmental and conservation policies mechanisms, and sustainability analysis of long-run impacts from current decisions.My research integrates ecology and economics to analyze the spatial pattern and value of ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, and other objectives that affect human well-being, and analyzes how these objectives are impacted by various human decisions on land use, resource use, energy production, and food production.

VDr. Portnoy is a microbiologist and immunologist whose research focuses on the pathogenesis and immunobiology of intracellular pathogens, specifically the facultative intracellular bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes. His lab has been instrumental in the identification and characterization of bacterial determinants that allow this fascinating microorganism to infect mammalian cells, escape from a membrane-bound compartment, grow rapidly in the host cell cytosol, and exploit a host system of actin-based motility to spread from cell to cell. Among the important concepts to emerge from this research is the observation that L. monocytogenes infection does not lead to appreciable cell death, while mutants that kill their host cell or strains engineered to activate host cell death pathways are avirulent. Infection with L. monocytogenes also leads to the rapid development of cell-mediated immunity. Portnoy showed that immune cells have a cytosolic surveillance pathway that recognizes c-di-AMP, an essential bacterial signaling molecule, secreted through multidrug resistance efflux transporters where it activates the host STING protein. Portnoy has exploited the above bacterial properties and engineered attenuated L. monocytogenes strains that express foreign antigens and induce cell-mediated immunity. Numerous clinical trials based on these discoveries have shown promising results as immunotherapeutic treatments for cancer.Dr. Portnoy is a microbiologist and immunologist whose research focuses on the pathogenesis and immunobiology of intracellular pathogens, specifically the facultative intracellular bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes.

VJames Poterba studies the effect of tax policy on household and firm behavior along with the economics of an aging population.  The current tax system encourages households to save through Individual Retirement Accounts, 401 (k) plans, and similar programs.  Households would have done some of this saving even in the absence of tax incentives. Poterba has examined the degree of crowd-out between contributions to retirement saving accounts and other saving.  He has also studied the tax incentives that affect homeowners, and estimated how these tax provisions affect the demand for housing and the price of land and structures.  He is also studying the process by which households draw-down retirement saving in late life, with particular emphasis on the role of health shocks and changes in family status such as death of a spouse.  At a more macroeconomic level, he has studied the links between population age structure and the returns on various financial assets, with the goal of understanding how the aging of the Baby Boom in the United States may alter expected returns and thus influence retirement saving adequacy.James Poterba studies the effect of tax policy on household and firm behavior along with the economics of an aging population.  The current tax system encourages households to save through Individual Retirement Accounts, 401 (k) plans, and similar programs.  Households would have done some of this saving even in the absence of tax incentives.

My background is in particle physics and quantum field theory (subjects I still love), but in the 1990s I got excited about the possibility of solving otherwise intractable problems by exploiting quantum physics. I have proposed potential applications of quantum computers to quantum simulation and other hard problems, and I have developed methods for protecting quantum systems from decoherence using cleverly designed software and hardware. I am especially intrigued by the ways our deepening understanding of quantum information and quantum computing can be applied to other fundamental issues of physics, such as the classification of topological phases of matter, nonequilibrium quantum dynamics, the quantum properties of black holes, and the quantum structure of spacetime.

VThe Priess laboratory is interested in how single cells develop into complex, multicellular tissues and organs, and use the genetic and cell biological tools available with the model Caenorhabditis elegans for this research. They have identified several genes that function to polarize the fertilized egg, and that become localized asymmetrically during the first few cell divisions to specify cell fates. Other genes mediate interactions between the early cells that further diversify fates. All of these events operate within the context of a transcription factor, POP-1/TCF, that is localized asymmetrically between all sets of sister cells. This POP-1 asymmetry is reiterated at each cell division and provides, in essence, a spatial and temporal binary code that coordinates development. Their more recent studies have focused on how differentiated cells assemble into tissues with distinctive morphologies, such as tubes and rings, and they have showed a continued role for POP-1 in these late events. Other research interests include the interplay between developing germ cells and viruses that target germ cells.The Priess laboratory is interested in how single cells develop into complex, multicellular tissues and organs, and use the genetic and cell biological tools available with the model Caenorhabditis elegans for this research.

VJohn Pringle's laboratory works in two distinct areas. First, the group continues its long-standing use of yeast and other genetically tractable model organisms to investigate fundamental problems in cell biology, notably the mechanisms of cell polarization and cytokinesis. Particular current foci are to further elucidate the roles of the septin proteins and the mechanisms by which yeast, algae such as Chlamydomonas, and indeed most of the world's phylogenetically diverse eukaryotic cells can form cleavage furrows during cytokinesis without a type-II myosin and hence without the actomyosin contractile ring that has long been believed to be responsible for this process. Second, most of the group now works on developing the small sea anemone Aiptasia as a model system for studies of the molecular and cell biology of dinoflagellate-cnidarian symbiosis, which is critical for the survival of reef-building corals and other animals but remains very poorly understood. Processes under investigation include the recognition and signaling events involved in symbiosis establishment, the mechanisms coordinating the activities of the symbiotic partners during stable symbiosis, and the signaling and cellular processes involved in symbiosis breakdown under stress. A particular effort is to develop the genomic resources and genetic methods that will underpin future studies.John Pringle's laboratory works in two distinct areas.

VJohn Pringle is a geneticist and cell biologist who has worked in yeast and other organisms on the mechanisms of cell-cycle control, cell polarization, and cytokinesis; his contributions include discoveries about the roles of small GTPases in cytoskeletal organization and of the septin proteins in cytokinesis, and his laboratory performed the first synthetic-lethal genetic screen. Recently, he has switched much of his effort to studies of cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, a process critical to the growth of coral reefs. Pringle was born in Chicago and grew up in its suburbs, graduating from Evanston High School. He majored in mathematics at Harvard but became interested in population biology and began graduate school at Harvard in that area. However, first-year courses in genetics and cell biology inspired him to switch directions. After thesis work in yeast biochemistry, he switched to genetics and cell biology during postdoctoral studies at the University of Washington and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. He was on the faculties at the Universities of Michigan and North Carolina from 1975-2005 before moving to Stanford. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and of AAAS and has received lifetime-achievement awards in yeast genetics (Genetics Society of America) and cell biology (American Society for Cell Biology).John Pringle is a geneticist and cell biologist who has worked in yeast and other organisms on the mechanisms of cell-cycle control, cell polarization, and cytokinesis; his contributions include discoveries about the roles of small GTPases in cytoskeletal organization and of the septin proteins in cytokinesis, and his laboratory performed the first synthetic-lethal genetic screen.

VProf. Pulkkinen's main research interests concern the Sun-Earth connection including the entire chain from the Sun through the solar wind, to the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and middle atmosphere. The key question is how energy and plasma are transferred from the solar wind to the magnetosphere and ionosphere, and how they affect the dynamics of the plasma and electromagnetic fields in the near-Earth space. Pulkkinen has addressed these issues through developing empirical models that allow comparisons of spatial and temporal relationships of processes observed in different parts of the magnetosphere - ionosphere system. She and her group have developed methods to quantitatively evaluate the energy entry processes using large-scale plasma simulations and compared the results with in-situ observations from space. With these tools she has identified the key configurational changes that occur prior to and during geomagnetic storms and substorms, and the key role of the solar wind speed in driving the geomagnetic activity. As the dynamic processes generate energetic particle fluxes to the upper atmosphere, these results contribute to understanding the occurrence and dynamics of auroras in the northern and southern polar regions.Prof. Pulkkinen's main research interests concern the Sun-Earth connection including the entire chain from the Sun through the solar wind, to the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and middle atmosphere.

VGabriel Rabinovich's laboratory is interested in understanding the function of glycans and glycan-binding proteins in cellular processes relevant to immune regulation, tolerance and angiogenesis in health and disease. Using an interdisciplinary approach, they have demonstrated that endogenous galectins, a family of soluble glycan-binding proteins, can translate glycan-encoded information into novel regulatory programs that control inflammation, suppress autoimmune pathology and allow cancer cells to evade immune responses and promote blood vessel formation. Together with his team, Rabinovich has demonstrated that galectin-dependent regulatory programs can blunt harmful immune responses by selectively depleting pathogenic T cells, triggering differentiation of tolerogenic dendritic cells and promoting polarization of macrophages and microglia toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, they have identified a dynamically-regulated \u2018glycan signature\u2019 on immune cells that acts as an \u2018on-and-off\u2019 switch to control the regulatory function of galectins. They demonstrated that malignant cells can use the galectin-glycan pathway to create immunosuppressive networks that thwart antitumor responses. Notably, they found that galectin-glycan interactions can also preserve angiogenesis in tumors refractory to anti-angiogenic treatment by recapitulating the signaling activity of vascular endothelial growth factor. These findings open new possibilities for development of therapeutic strategies aimed at potentiating antitumor responses, limiting autoimmune inflammation and overcoming aberrant angiogenesis.Gabriel Rabinovich's laboratory is interested in understanding the function of glycans and glycan-binding proteins in cellular processes relevant to immune regulation, tolerance and angiogenesis in health and disease.

In particular, Radi has contributed to clarify the mechanisms of nitric oxide-dependent toxicity through its interaction with superoxide and the formation of peroxynitrite  and . He has extensively characterized the biological chemistry of peroxynitrite, including the discovery of free radical-dependent and independent reaction pathways, its impact in mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis via oxidation and nitration reactions and its role in pathology. He has contributed to the concept that an oxidizing environment can \u201cshift\u201d the physiological actions of nitric oxide towards pathophysiology. Radi\u2019s work facilitated the development, testing and chemical characterization of antioxidants that serve as peroxynitrite decomposition catalysts as well as mitochondrial-targeted redox-based drugs for application in cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and inflammatory conditions. Additionally, Radi has shown that peroxynitrite is a cytotoxic effector in cellular immune responses against intracellular pathogens such as the causative agent of Chagas disease, i, and how microbial antioxidant systems constitute virulence factors. He has authored over 210 peer-review papers and 40 reviews, with an -index = 72 (ISI, Feb 2016) and over 22,000 citations.Radi´s research activities have focused on the biochemistry, cell biology, relevance to disease mechanisms and therapeutics of free radicals, oxidants and antioxidant systems.

VAs a geologist, I have studied the tectonic evolution of the Andes, with emphasis in its present tectonic setting and in the evolution of its basement. The analyses of the Present tectonic kinematics of the Andes, as a natural laboratory to investigate the surface geological processes, have shown that these mountains have striking longitudinal geological variations controlled by the collision of aseismic and seismic oceanic ridges, as well as island arcs and oceanic plateaux. The understanding of these geological complexities allows me extrapolating these conditions through time, and this fact improves the comprehension of the processes that led to the formation of the Andes. Those mechanisms have been extrapolated to the Paleozoic times, and our Laboratorio de Tectï¿½nica Andina was the first to decipher the early history of amalgamation of the Andean basement through dockings and break-ups of microcontinental blocks. These processes have been identified along the Andean Chain, associated with different modes of subduction. We were able to recognize several geological processes associated with the shallowing and steepening of the oceanic slab being subducted beneath South America. The achieved knowledge was applied to ancient Precambrian orogens of the South American basement contributing to understand the evolution of the entire continent.As a geologist, I have studied the tectonic evolution of the Andes, with emphasis in its present tectonic setting and in the evolution of its basement.

VJames Randerson\u2019s laboratory is interested in improving our understanding of contemporary and future changes in the global biosphere. Using high-resolution NASA satellite imagery, the laboratory explores how global patterns of fires are changing in response to climate warming and intensification of land use. Field observations place constraints on the magnitude and composition of fire emissions, and atmospheric models enable researchers to understand fire impacts on atmospheric chemistry, downwind ecosystems, and human health. From the design and analysis of Earth System Model simulations, the research team is interested in exploring how drought and climate-carbon cycle feedbacks are likely to evolve in the future.

Field observations place constraints on the magnitude and composition of fire emissions, and atmospheric models enable researchers to understand fire impacts on atmospheric chemistry, downwind ecosystems, and human health. From the design and analysis of Earth System Model simulations, the research team is interested in exploring how drought and climate-carbon cycle feedbacks are likely to evolve in the future.

Through detailed analysis of deep sea sediment cores, she has generated records of geochemical, paleontological, and paleoclimatic change that have advanced the study of Earth\u2019s climate on tectonic, orbital, and millennial time scales. For much of her career she has also worked to improve the timescales and stratigraphy that provide the foundation for the study of Earth\u2019s history. Most recently her research group has focused on the reconstruction of sea level and ice volume during past warm climate intervals with the goal of improving predictions of future sea level rise in response to global warming.Maureen E.

VNicholas Read's theoretical work has identified several novel phases of matter, including some that have either been observed, and others that continue to inspire experimental searches. In the fractional quantum Hall effect, which occurs in a two-dimensional system of electrons in a high magnetic field at low temperature, these include liquid states which are predicted to support point-like quasiparticle excitations with unusual (non-Abelian) statistics properties, in which quantum information could be stored non-locally. Such excitations could be the basis for a form of quantum computing that is robust against errors caused by the environment. Some of these are connected with Majorana zero mode operators. In other work, he elucidated the properties of two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets when their order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations. In still other work, he has found exact results for electrons in the presence of a random background potential, and has clarified the nature of the replica-symmetry breaking theory for short-range spin glasses.Nicholas Read's theoretical work has identified several novel phases of matter, including some that have either been observed, and others that continue to inspire experimental searches.

VElsa M. Redmond is an anthropological archaeologist whose expertise lies in Latin America. Her theoretical interest is the evolution of early complex societies. Redmond has examined the role that warfare, particularly inter-village raiding, played in the emergence of centralized, hierarchical societies (chiefdoms) ruled by hereditary chiefs in South America. She has also investigated the role of expansionistic conquest warfare in the formation of the early Zapotec state in southern Mexico. Her models of chiefdom and state emergence marshal both ethnohistoric data on warfare practices and archaeological data. Together with her husband and collaborator, Charles S. Spencer, Redmond has carried out long-term archaeological field projects in Oaxaca, Mexico and in Barinas, Venezuela. Since 1993, Redmond and Spencer have been carrying out archaeological research in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, designed to investigate the process of Zapotec state formation. She is also engaged in ethnohistorical research on the earliest Spanish encounters with Amerindian societies throughout the circum-Caribbean area, to assess the nature of indigenous resistance to the European incursions.Elsa M.

VNancy Reid\u2019s research emphasizes the use of asymptotic expansions to suggest more accurate approximations to standard statistical quantities, both for use in applications, and as a means to study theoretical aspects of the foundations of inference. This research has shed light on the interface between Bayesian and frequentist methods, showing in particular that except in special cases, Bayesian and frequentist inference cannot agree exactly, unless one permits the use of data-dependent priors. Her current interests include the use of various types of pseudo-likelihoods for inference from data with complex structure, particularly the use of composite likelihood for simplifying inference in models with potentially complex dependencies. She and her students and colleagues are studying both the theoretical properties of various proposals, and the interconnections among them. Her applied areas of interest include environmental epidemiology, design of experiments, and inference from large-scale surveys. She has a long-standing interest in conveying statistical arguments to the lay public, and the importance of using data to inform public policy.Nancy Reid\u2019s research emphasizes the use of asymptotic expansions to suggest more accurate approximations to standard statistical quantities, both for use in applications, and as a means to study theoretical aspects of the foundations of inference.

VDanny Reinberg\u2019s career-long investigation of the mechanistic basis of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in mammalian cells incorporated increasingly complex and biologically relevant contexts. The reconstitution of transcription initiation i on naked DNA revealed fundamental mechanistic features of this process. The generation of biologically relevant chromatinized templates facilitated the discovery of FACT and its role in enabling the polymerase to traverse impeding nucleosomes. A major effort was made towards understanding signals and factors that naturally convert the chromatin structure to a repressed state, inaccessible to the transcription machinery. The means by which repressive complexes (Sin3 and NuRD) foster transcriptionally inactive chromatin were revealed.  Some of these processes are epigenetic, being both independent of DNA sequence and heritable such that distinct cellular gene expression programs are re-established in daughter cells. The laboratory investigated specific modifications of the histones that are associated with repressed chromatin with respect to their catalysis, their outcome to transcription and in some cases their inheritance.  The mechanistic basis for how the epigenetically-related PRC2 complex establishes a repressive chromatin domain and how this domain is copied during cell division was derived.  Investigations were initiated into epigenetic mechanisms within the context of a whole organism that exhibits social interaction: ants.Danny Reinberg\u2019s career-long investigation of the mechanistic basis of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription in mammalian cells incorporated increasingly complex and biologically relevant contexts.

VProfessor Richeson\u2019s research examines psychological phenomena related to cultural diversity. Her work generally considers the ways in which sociocultural group memberships such as race, gender, and socio-economic status shape the way people think, feel, and behave, especially during interactions with members of different sociocultural groups. Specifically, she and her students examine antecedents and consequences of prejudice and stereotyping from the perspectives of both members of culturally devalued, stigmatized groups, as well as members of traditionally dominant societal groups. One primary focus of her lab is on the dynamics of interracial contact.  This line of work has revealed the roles of concerns about appearing prejudiced (for racial majority individuals) and concerns about being the target of prejudice (for racial minority individuals) in shaping cognitive, affective, and behavioral dynamics of these interactions. Richeson has also found that these prejudice concerns also shape basic processes of mind and brain, including the allocation of attention and memory, as well as decision-making. Ultimately, Richeson\u2019s goal in developing these research streams is to contribute to the eradication of bigotry by gaining a better understanding of intergroup conflict and how best to realize the promise of culturally diverse environments.Professor Richeson\u2019s research examines psychological phenomena related to cultural diversity.

VMy research interests lie in developing a fundamental understanding of molecular interactions that occur at complex surfaces. In recent years we have focused on measuring the hydrogen bonding characteristics of water surfaces in contact with a variety of media. Using a combination of surface nonlinear spectroscopy and computational methods we have shown how this bonding varies as molecules move from the topmost surface layer to the bulk aqueous phase. In studies of water in contact with a variety of hydrophobic liquids we have shown how weak bonding interactions between water and the oil create a highly structured interface that greatly influences the adsorption and assembly of surfactants, polymers, nanoparticles, and even the transport and ions across the interface. A variety of new findings have resulted from our continuing studies of environmentally important processes at vapor/water interfaces. For example we have made the first detailed measurements of a gas (SO2) forming a reversible complex with surface water molecules and have shown that nitric acid at the surface of water acts as a weak acid, in contrast to its highly acidic behavior in bulk water. These and other ongoing studies in our laboratory provide continued surprises and challenges in our quest to understand the fundamental characteristics of aqueous surfaces that underlie some of the most important environmental, biological, chemical and technological processes on the planet.My research interests lie in developing a fundamental understanding of molecular interactions that occur at complex surfaces.

VMy research has focused on the control of molting and metamorphosis in insects by the steroid hormone ecdysone and the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH). Ecdysone causes molting as the insect grows, then genetic switching of developmental programs at metamorphosis. Juvenile hormone allows molting but prevents metamorphosis. Our studies using the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and more recently Drosophila have shown that JH prevents metamorphosis by modulating the turning on and off of a pupal-specifying transcription factor Broad by ecdysone. Broad was also shown to be critical for premetamorphic development in more basal insects with gradual metamorphosis, indicating that Broad plays a key role in the evolution of metamorphosis. We have also shown how these two hormones interact during a larval molt to regulate key enzymes involved in cuticular pigmentation. Most recently we have turned to Drosophila to study the role of JH in the prepupal development of the nervous system showing that it acts a brake to ecdysone-induced premature differentiation. Other interests have been in the neuroendocrine control of behavior, notably our discovery of eclosion hormone that has a key role in initiating insect ecdysis; endocrine interactions between parasitoids and their host; and the discovery of antennal proteins that are involved in odorant transport to the receptor and odorant degradation.My research has focused on the control of molting and metamorphosis in insects by the steroid hormone ecdysone and the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH).

Because the field was new and unexplored, discoveries were easy and included ultraluminous infrared galaxies (now thought to be triggered by mergers of massive galaxies and an evolutionary step toward the birth of quasars), starbursts (vigorous episodes of star formation that can dominate the output of a galaxy), the emission of active galactic nuclei (Seyfert galaxies, BL Lacertae objects, quasars), young stars embedded in dust - the list is long. I have also participated in the rapid development of more sophisticated instruments, including utilizing high performance detector arrays and telescopes in space. My attention has turned to the new topics made accessible with these advances, such as planetary debris disks (material generated in collisions among planetestimals in other planetary systems).

VCarol has had a long-term research interest in developing and applying mass spectrometry to structural biology. Her current recent focus is in uncovering the roles of small molecules in the structure and function of membrane proteins. To uncover these relationships she is developing a range of mass spectrometry tools that maintain protein lipid interactions as close as possible to their native bilayer environments. Using these approaches she and her team have discovered lipids that are involved in flippase reactions, in mediating drug binding and in dictating the oligomeric state of receptors and transporters. Her current research involves the study of G-protein coupled receptors and their downstream signaling partners. Capturing these receptors in the gas phase of the mass spectrometer has enabled her team to study the impact of drug binding on different kinases and on signaling cascades. Overall, therefore, her research is not only providing new insight into the role of lipids in stabilizing membrane protein complexes but is also playing an important part in drug discovery.Carol has had a long-term research interest in developing and applying mass spectrometry to structural biology.

VDuring her early research Carol developed and applied mass spectrometry to show how protein folding could be monitored in the presence of molecular chaperones. This research prompted her to find new ways to preserve mega Dalton complexes in the gas phase and led her to uncover the heterogeneity and dynamics of numerous multi protein complexes. In recent work she demonstrated the numerous roles played by lipids in regulating the structure and function of membrane protein assemblies. Her current interest is in uncovering the synergy of lipid and drug binding. With this information she is exploring new ways to characterize receptor-signaling complexes. Carol\u2019s graduate education was completed whilst working full-time in industry. She was subsequently admitted to the University of Cambridge where she completed her PhD in two years. Following an eight-year career break, to begin raising her three children, she returned to research at Oxford. In 2001 she became the first female professor in Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, returning to Oxford in 2009 to take up the Chair of Dr. Lee\u2019s Professor of Chemistry. She is President Elect of the Royal Society of Chemistry, a Fellow of the Royal Society London and a Fellow of the UK Academy of Medical Sciences.During her early research Carol developed and applied mass spectrometry to show how protein folding could be monitored in the presence of molecular chaperones.

VAs a hydrologist I have studied the structure of the drainage network of river basins and the fundamental dynamics responsible for its well defined statistical characteristics regardless of geographical location. Thus we have shown that the minimization of a Hamiltonian representing the energy expenditure in the conveyance of water from all sites of the basin to a common outlet leads to networks whose scaling characteristics are identical to those found in natural basins. These so called Optimal Channel Networks are very useful in further studies relating the hydrologic response of a basin to its geomorphological structure. Very much connected to the previous interest have been my studies of the role of the drainage network and other hydrologic drivers on the large scale signatures describing the spatial structure of aquatic biodiversity in river basins. I have also been trying to establish the quantitative links between climate,soil,and vegetation in arid and semiarid regions through the probabilistic structure of soil water content as function of the stochasticity of climate interacting with soil and vegetation characteristics. More recently I have also been involved in the probabilistic characterization of hydroperiods in wetlands as a key mechanism impacting vegetation structure and biodiversity in these ecosystems.As a hydrologist I have studied the structure of the drainage network of river basins and the fundamental dynamics responsible for its well defined statistical characteristics regardless of geographical location.

VHenry Roediger\u2019s research is concerned with several broad topics concerning human memory. One thrust of his work concerns the power of retrieval practice as a memory enhancer, producing greater learning than other study strategies. This research has been extended into educational practice. Roediger has also developed a straightforward technique to induce false memories in laboratory settings, and this paradigm has been widely used to study illusory memories. An earlier program of research involved experiments elucidating the relation between explicit and implicit memory tests, and he is known for advancing the theoretical approach of transfer appropriate processing to account for differences among tests. Two more recent research interests currently being pursued are the study of people with extraordinary memory abilities and the study of collective (or historical) memory. The former involves cognitive assessment of people who have developed great abilities in remembering (e.g., contestants in memory tournaments, people who memorize large parts of the Bible, among others) to determine if they have cognitive abilities in common. The latter topic is concerned with how people in groups remember, such as how Americans remember events of World War II or other historical milestones, and how these memories shape political discourse.Henry Roediger\u2019s research is concerned with several broad topics concerning human memory.

The work combines fundamental studies with forward-looking engineering efforts in a way that promotes positive feedback between the two.  Areas of current focus include soft composite materials for conformal electronics, nanophotonic structures, microfluidic devices, photovoltaics and microelectromechanical systems, all with an emphasis on bio-inspired or bio-integrated systems. These efforts in engineering science are highly multidisciplinary, and combine expertise from nearly every traditional field of technical and academic study.Rogers\u2019 research interests are in understanding and exploiting unique characteristics of 'soft' materials, such as polymers, liquid crystals, biological tissues and hybrid combinations of them with unusual classes of micro/nanomaterials, in the form of ribbons, wires, membranes, tubes or related.  A goal is to control and induce novel electronic and photonic responses in these materials and to develop deterministic or biomimetic approaches for patterning them and guiding their growth.

VMy main research field is international macroeconomics. My 2009 book with Carmen M Reinhart This Time is Different:  Eight Centuries of Financial Folly develops a novel database for studying international financial crises based on annual data for seventy countries covering 800 years.  Our research shows shows that financial crises are far more universal than previously believed. Perhaps the most important result from the book was to show that the striking similarities in the aftermath of financial crises across key macroeconomic indicators, including unemployment, housing and stock prices, growth and debt.  These similarities are surprising given the vastly different political, institutional, legal and economic circumstances across which various crises have unfolded, and suggest deeper behavioral links.  The research has proven quite helpful to policymakers in  understanding the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.   My 1985 Quarterly Journal of Economics paper  took a novel institutional approach to solving the credibility problem in monetary policy that had been identified by (later) Nobel prize winners Kydland and Prescott.  At the time of its writing, very few countries had independent central banks incentivized to hit inflation targets. Now it is the norm across much of the world.My main research field is international macroeconomics.

VRosakis is an expert in static and dynamic failure mechanics of solid materials at all length and time scales. Earlier work includes the study of dynamic, failure (cracking, debonding, and adiabatic localization) of structural metals and brittle materials, as well as the shear rupture of bonded heterogeneous solids and composites, by using high speed photography and infrared thermography. In 1999, Rosakis introduced the concept of \u201cLaboratory Earthquakes\u201d and developed a unique, highly instrumented, laboratory facility, which reproduces the physics governing rupture dynamics of crustal earthquakes. His additional experimental discovery of \u201csuper-shear\u201d, frictional rupture speeds has revolutionized the way earthquake events are interpreted, validating inferences of super-shear growth in many sufficiently large earthquakes, which resulted in improved understanding of zones of intense ground motion damage. His laboratory discoveries and modeling have also helped resolve a number of additional cutting-edge problems in earthquake source physics, including the directionality of rupture growth in heterogeneous faults, the mechanism of creation of off-fault damage and the selection between \u201cpulse-like\u201d or \u201ccrack-like\u201d modes in earthquake slip. Additional research interests include the reliability of thin-films and in-situ wafer metrology, as well as hypervelocity impact phenomena for the study of micrometeorite threats on space structures.Rosakis is an expert in static and dynamic failure mechanics of solid materials at all length and time scales.

VThroughout my career I have explored a range of phenomena that play a role in non-optimal judgment and decision making including "belief perseverance," the "false consensus effect," the "hostile media effect," "reactive devaluation," and "naï¿½ve realism." With my colleagues and students I have sought to bring complex real-world phenomena into the laboratory in studies that further our understanding of the strengths and weaknesses that people display as they attempt to understand and influence their social worlds. Work with my long-time collaborators Richard Nisbett and Mark Lepper helped both to identify the overarching "lessons" that emerge as the cumulative contributions of half a century of experimental social psychology -- in particular "situationism," "subjectivism," "equilibration," and the striving to maintain a coherent and positive view of the self -- to forge a bridge between social psychology and the judgment and decision-making tradition in cognitive psychology. My recent work has increasingly focused on sources of interpersonal and intergroup misunderstanding and the psychological barriers that prevent disputants from reaching mutually agreeable improvements over the status quo. I have also sought to apply the lessons from this laboratory research program in real-world efforts at second-track diplomacy and implementation of public peace processes in both Northern Ireland and the Middle East.Throughout my career I have explored a range of phenomena that play a role in non-optimal judgment and decision making including "belief perseverance," the "false consensus effect," the "hostile media effect," "reactive devaluation," and "naï¿½ve realism."

VI am a theoretical chemist who finds nothing more engaging then to try to understand the molecular-level processes that underlie an important experimental observation whose origin is controversial or puzzling. My work lies almost entirely within amorphous condensed phase materials (liquids, polymers, molecular clusters). I have two very long-standing themes in my work. The first is in the role of liquids as an environment for chemistry, with a particular emphasis on water, and its active role in modulating the interaction free energy among solutes, both biological and synthetic. The second is understanding the quantum world within the same dense material domain, including the direct evaluation of the spectroscopic signatures of molecular species and tracking the evolution of energy in molecular excited states. Most recently, I have emphasized understanding the time evolution of electronic photo-excited states, particularly in candidate photovoltaic organic materials. Having grown up along with the explosion in computational capacity, I depend on computational methods as a route to study molecular processes. We are constantly involved in method development to open up access to increasingly complex dynamical features of chemical systems, such as quantized motion of low mass nuclei (especially protons), electronic energy dissipation, and energy or charge transfer.I am a theoretical chemist who finds nothing more engaging then to try to understand the molecular-level processes that underlie an important experimental observation whose origin is controversial or puzzling.

VRodney Rothstein's laboratory uses yeast as a model organism to study genome stability, DNA repair and recombination. He pioneered the use of recombination to alter genomes and used these methods to isolate novel genes involved in the maintenance of genome stability. His \u201cone-step\u201d gene disruption method led directly to the \u201cknockout\u201d technology used in many organisms to exploit recombination to either remove or insert DNA sequences into specific genomic positions. His laboratory discovered many conserved genes affecting the control of genome stability, including Top3, a novel type I topoisomerase and Sgs1, a DNA helicase, mutation of its human homologues (Blm, Wrn and Rts) cause cancer predisposition and/or premature aging. By combining genetics and cell biology, his lab studies the choreography of the DNA damage response in living cells. They showed that recombination foci assemble at chromosome breaks and act as repair centers capable of repairing more than one DSB. They also found that chromosomal loci increase their mobility in response to DNA damage. They developed tools to screen for the ensuing genetic interactions caused by gene overexpression. They are using this approach to gain insight into the pathways that are disrupted by the common amplicons found in cancer cells.Rodney Rothstein's laboratory uses yeast as a model organism to study genome stability, DNA repair and recombination.

VAs a statistician, my research focuses on the design of empirical studies, including surveys and experiments, and the analysis of data from such studies.  I regard myself as both theoretical and as applied, in the sense that essentially all the statistical work that I have done is stimulated by real problems, but when addressing such problems, I try to find solutions that solve the class of problems represented by the ones being faced.  Thus, I have made contributions to the handling of data sets with missing values, including establishing terminology (e.g., missing at random, ignorability), creating (with coauthors) algorithms for parameter estimation with incomplete data (e.g., the EM algorithm and its extensions -- ECM, ECME, PXEM), and multiple imputation.  These research activities were inspired by real projects on which I consulted, including ones for the US federal government.  I have also made contributions to causal inference in randomized experiments and in observational studies.  Here, I also established terminology, including potential outcomes, the stability assumption (SUTVA -- the stable unit treatment value assumption), and the assignment mechanism.  I have also, with others, created propensity score methods and principal stratification.  The general framework is often referenced as the "Rubin Causal Model," especially when the mode of inference is Bayesian, which I prefer.  I continue to conduct research in these and other areas.As a statistician, my research focuses on the design of empirical studies, including surveys and experiments, and the analysis of data from such studies.

VI am a geochemist who uses observations from a wide array of Earth Science disciplines to determine the average composition of continental crust and understand how continents form. Earth is the only planet in our solar system with continents, comprised of relatively low-density, SiO2-rich continental crust, and an underlying mantle "lid". Determining the composition of the continental crust is important because it contains much of the Earth's heat-producing elements (K, Th and U). Knowing the concentrations of these elements in the crust helps to determine what remains in the rest of the Earth, where they provide the energy for plate tectonics. The continental crust has an average composition of "andesite" -- a relatively silica-rich igneous rock that is unlikely to form by melting of the mantle. This observation leads to the fundamental problem that the building blocks of the continents (mantle-derived basalts) do not match the edifice (andesite). With my students and collaborators I have been systematically testing hypotheses advanced to explain the origin of this unusual crust. For example, we have shown that portions of the SiO2-depleted lower continental crust may have gravitationally separated and sunk into the deeper mantle, leaving behind more SiO2-rich crust. We are currently seeking to quantify the degree to which weathering has influenced the composition of the continental crust.I am a geochemist who uses observations from a wide array of Earth Science disciplines to determine the average composition of continental crust and understand how continents form.

VDavid M. Sabatini\u2019s laboratory studies the mechanisms that regulate physiological and pathological growth and metabolism in mammals. His lab has focused significant efforts on the mTOR pathway. This signaling network, the target of the well-known drug rapamycin, is a central regulator of growth and aging and is dysregulated in common diseases, including cancer. The laboratory identified many of the core components of the pathway, including the mTORcontaining complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, as well as the machinery through which mTORC1 senses amino acids to promote anabolism. This latter work led to the discovery of the direct sensors for leucine and arginine and identified the lysosome as a signaling organelle. Sabatini\u2019s laboratory has also studied how feeding and fasting regulate tissue physiology, including hepatic ketogenesis, intestinal stem cell self-renewal, and tumor growth. A part of the laboratory focuses on how central small molecule metabolism affects growth control and has investigated the role of the serine synthesis pathway in cancer and used genetic screens to define essential functions for mitochondria in cell proliferation.  Lastly, the laboratory has been active in technology development, and has created methods for purifying unstable protein complexes, cell-based microarrays for high throughput screening of cDNAs, and genome-scale RNAi and CRISPR/Cas9 libraries that are widely used.David M.

VSachdev\u2019s research develops the theory of quantum many-body physics, while keeping a close eye on experimental developments. Many of the most interesting problems are motivated by observations on the copper and iron based high temperature superconductors. These materials exhibit unusual metallic states known as the \u201cpseudogap\u201d and the \u201cstrange metal\u201d out of which superconductivity appears as the temperature is lowered: thus we cannot address the key problem of the critical temperature of superconductivity without an understanding of these remarkable metals. By a recent analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy data, Sachdev and collaborators have argued that the pseudogap displays characteristics of quantum spin liquids, which are quantum states of electrons with long-range entanglement. The strange metal is the most common example of a state of quantum matter without particle-like (or \u201cquasiparticle\u201d) excitations. Sachdev has had a long-standing interest in the theory of quantum matter without quasiparticles: most recently, he has argued that holographic models, obtained from string theory, provide valuable insight into the structure of such states. Sachdev\u2019s research also extends to other systems with non-trivial quantum many body states, including graphene structures, and ultracold atomic gases.Sachdev\u2019s research develops the theory of quantum many-body physics, while keeping a close eye on experimental developments.

VSubir Sachdev is a condensed matter physicist well known for his research on quantum phase transitions and its application to a variety of quantum materials, such as the high temperature superconductors. His research seeks to illuminate the boundary between the everyday world we live in - in which many but not all phenomena can be explained through classical physics - and the subatomic world of quantum physics. These two worlds come together at a "quantum phase transition\u201d, where there is a change in the macroscopic character of the quantum state describing a many-particle system, and manifestations of quantum entanglement appear naturally at long distances. His book Quantum Phase Transitions (Cambridge University Press, 1999 and 2011) has formed the basis of much subsequent research. More recently he pioneered the application of string theory to the study of quantum phase transitions in systems of ultracold bosons, and to the \u201cstrange metal\u201d state found in many modern materials. Sachdev was educated in India before attending MIT and Harvard where he obtained his Ph.D. degree in theoretical physics. He held professional positions at Bell Labs (1985\u20131987) and at Yale University (1987\u20132005), where he was a Professor of Physics, before returning to Harvard. He also holds a visiting position as the James Clerk Maxwell Chair in Theoretical Physics at the Perimeter Institute. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, fellow of the American Physical Society and has been awarded several honors, among them the Lorentz Chair, Instituut-Lorentz, Leiden University in 2012, and the Salam Distinguished Lecturer at the International Center for Theoretical Physics, Trieste in 2014.Subir Sachdev is a condensed matter physicist well known for his research on quantum phase transitions and its application to a variety of quantum materials, such as the high temperature superconductors.

Much of his past work has focused on boosting, an approach to machine learning based on the idea of gathering and combining many weak and moderately inaccurate prediction rules. He is also particularly interested in online learning in which the data arrives sequentially, one example at a time. These two problem areas are in fact closely related, and have connections to other research areas, such as game theory and maximum-entropy modeling. Most of his work is concerned with theoretical issues, but he has applied machine learning, for instance, to problems arising in bioinformatics, neuroscience, and the modeling of plant and animal populations.Robert Schapire\u2019s main research interest is in machine learning, a field that aims to develop automatic methods for making accurate predictions or intelligent decisions based on past experience or observations.

VDouglas Schemske's research investigates the ecological factors that contribute to adaptation and speciation, and the genetic architecture of adaptive traits. Through long-term field experiments, he seeks to identify how adaptations arise. Key questions include: Is adpatation due to few or many genes? Do adaptive genes have large or small effects? Do adaptations often display fitness tradeoffs, i.e. do traits and genes that improve performance in one environment often reduce performance elsewhere? He and his colleagues have employed a number of different plant systems to address these questions. Work on two closely-related species of monkeyflowers with different pollinators revealed that the transition from bee-to hummingbird polllination was due to a relatively small number of genetic changes, with some of very large effect. Reciprocal transplants of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana between the northern and southern edges of its native range in Europe identified flowering time and freezing tolerance as major adaptive traits. Each was controlled in part by genes of large effect, and for freezing tolerance, there was strong evidence of fitness tradeoffs. The results from these and other studies lend support to the idea that strong ecological interactions coupled with major genes and genetic tradeoffs are integral elements of adaptation.Douglas Schemske's research investigates the ecological factors that contribute to adaptation and speciation, and the genetic architecture of adaptive traits.

VI investigate recent adaptive radiation, whereby a single ancestor diversifies rapidly into an array of species that inhabit a variety of environments and that differ in traits used to exploit those environments. I am especially interested in the selection pressures that drive the origin of new species, the ecological interactions that lead to the evolution of species differences, the genetic basis of these differences, and the wider impacts of diversification on ecosystems. I addressed these questions initially in field studies of Darwin\u2019s finches, but over recent decades I have developed for study a natural system having many advantages, the threespine sticklebacks of fresh water and coastal marine areas of British Columbia. Our work has included the quantitative estimation of natural selection surfaces and ancestral traits, the experimental study of species interactions, natural selection and evolution, and the discovery of genetic differences at interesting loci and their fitness consequences. My second interest is the role of evolutionary processes and historical events in the development and maintenance of Earth's major biodiversity gradients. For example, we have studied the role of variation in the rates at which new species form in the evolution and maintenance of the latitudinal diversity gradient, the widespread tendency for species numbers to be much greater in the tropics than in the temperate zone.I investigate recent adaptive radiation, whereby a single ancestor diversifies rapidly into an array of species that inhabit a variety of environments and that differ in traits used to exploit those environments.

VDolph Schluter received his BSc in ecology in 1977 from the University of Guelph. He obtained his PhD in 1983 from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, under the supervision or Peter R. Grant (NAS).  For his doctoral thesis, Schluter studied ecological mechanisms driving evolution in island assemblages of Darwin's finch species. For his fieldwork, he and an assistant spent nearly two years living in a tent on remote and otherwise uninhabited Galápagos Islands. Schluter\u2019s work on the finches culminated in the first estimates from nature of mean fitness (\u201cadaptive\u201d) landscapes, which successfully predicted mean beak sizes of Galápagos ground finches. He was able to compare these landscapes to fitness functions from data on natural selection, using a method he also pioneered, and to test shifts caused by interspecific competition between species. This work was a key component of a long-term study of the Darwin's finches that has been recognized as the most successful ever field study of evolution.  Schluter obtained a tenure track position at UBC in 1989, where he played a steering role in building one of the world\u2019s strongest research groups in biodiversity science.Dolph Schluter received his BSc in ecology in 1977 from the University of Guelph.

This work led to a collaboration with R. E. Ricklefs (NAS) that produced a highly influential coedited volume on global patterns of species diversity (Chicago, 1993). At the same time, Schluter initiated work on BC stickleback fish, which enabled his landmark experimental and comparative studies on mechanisms driving the origin and divergence of new species. This work yielded advances on almost every significant research problem in adaptive radiation, and his stickleback species pairs have become one of the best-known natural study systems in evolutionary biology. The work inspired many ideas, culminating in his now classic text, The Ecology of Adaptive Radiation (Oxford, 2000). His subsequent collaboration with D. Kingsley led to the discovery of key genes underlying species differences and made the stickleback a \u201csupermodel\u201d for studies of adaptive genetic variation.Between 1983 and 1990 Schluter studied the evolution of bird assemblages, during which he developed methods to estimate convergence between faunas.

This work led to a collaboration with R. E. Ricklefs (NAS) that produced a highly influential coedited volume on global patterns of species diversity (Chicago, 1993). At the same time, Schluter initiated work on BC stickleback fish, which enabled his landmark experimental and comparative studies on mechanisms driving the origin and divergence of new species. This work yielded advances on almost every significant research problem in adaptive radiation, and his stickleback species pairs have become one of the best-known natural study systems in evolutionary biology.

VRobert Schoelkopf\u2019s laboratory is focused on the development of solid-state quantum bits (qubits) for quantum computing, and the advancement of their performance to practical levels. The group has been an innovator in high-speed measurement techniques at ultra-low temperatures, and invented numerous devices such as the RF single-electron transistor, the shot noise thermometer, and the transmon qubit. Together with collaborators at Yale in the groups of Professors Michel Devoret and Steve Girvin, they have pioneered the new field of \u201ccircuit quantum electrodynamics,\u201d which allows quantum information to be distributed by microwave signals on wires. The lab has produced many firsts in the field based on these ideas, including the development of a \u201cquantum bus\u201d for information, and the first demonstrations of quantum algorithms and quantum error correction with integrated circuits. When combined with the steady improvement of device performance and coherence, these types of superconducting quantum circuits are becoming a promising route to scalable quantum information processing.Robert Schoelkopf\u2019s laboratory is focused on the development of solid-state quantum bits (qubits) for quantum computing, and the advancement of their performance to practical levels.

VJulian Schroeder\u2019s research interests focus on elucidating signal transduction mechanisms and pathways that initiate and mediate resistance to environmental abiotic stresses in plants linked to water. Water-linked stresses have substantial negative impacts and reduce plant growth. His research has pioneered the characterization of plant ion channels and their regulation mechanisms with a focus on abiotic stress responses. Schroeder\u2019s research is elucidating the mechanisms mediating gas exchange regulation in plants by stomatal pores through which plants lose over 90% of their water via transpiration. Within this research Schroeder\u2019s laboratory has identified mechanisms, including ion channel regulation mechanisms mediating signaling by the plant stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA). His laboratory is characterizing signal transduction mechanisms in stomatal guard cells in response to drought-induced abscisic acid production and stomatal signaling in response to the continuing rise in atmospheric CO. In other research Schroeder\u2019s laboratory identified the plant HKT transporters and showed how AtHKT1 in Arabidopsis protects plants from salinity stress. HKT transporter quantitative trait loci are being used by plant scientists and breeders to enhance salt tolerance of major staple crops, including rice and wheat. In other research Schroeder\u2019s laboratory has identified key mechanisms by which plants protect themselves from and accumulate heavy metals, which are important for future engineering of plants for bioremediation of contaminated soils and waters.Julian Schroeder\u2019s research interests focus on elucidating signal transduction mechanisms and pathways that initiate and mediate resistance to environmental abiotic stresses in plants linked to water.

VI am fascinated by how protein functions are dynamically switched to drive regulatory pathways. In eukaryotes, a major form of regulation involves covalent protein modification by a diverse array of ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs), which impart extraordinary changes in the fates of their targets. As examples, some polyubiquitin chains mediate proteasomal degradation, whereas ubiquitin\u2019s closest relative, NEDD8, has the distinct function of activating hundreds of ubiquitinating enzymes. By contrast, Atg8 is ligated to a lipid, regulating numerous features of bulk degradation via autophagy. We are interested in how dedicated cascades of E1 activating, E2 conjugating, and E3 ligase enzymes direct these UBLs to their targets to regulate the cell cycle, autophagy, and other processes. Regulation depends on numerous E2 and E3 enzymes (roughly 30 and 600, respectively, in humans) coordinately matching particular UBLs and substrates in a highly specific manner. My lab has determined a series of crystal structures that serve as molecular \u201csnapshots\u201d revealing how UBLs are activated by E1 enzymes, transferred between E1s, E2s and different types of E3 enzymes to particular target proteins, and how UBL attachment can transform the functions of modified proteins. Our current research focuses on understanding how E3 ligases are regulated to ensure that targets are modified under the right circumstances to mediate proper regulation, how UBL modifications alter the functions of targets, and consequences of defects in UBL pathways associated with certain cancers and neurodegenerative disorders.I am fascinated by how protein functions are dynamically switched to drive regulatory pathways.

VAs a geneticist and biochemist, I have studied molecular principles underlying the innate immune system of plants. I am particularly interested in understanding how immune sensors perceive the presence of non-self structures, derived from pathogens, and how the activated sensors initiate powerful immune responses that terminate pathogen growth. I use for these studies the model plant Arabidopsis and, for comparison, crop plants to learn how humans have influenced through the process of domestication the effectiveness of the immune system. I found that one of these immune sensors, designated MLA, requires for its function a dedicated folding machinery for the assembly of an autorepressed receptor form and that the activated receptor initiates immune responses as homodimer from a C-terminal protein module. I have also studied the molecular basis underlying the host range of pathogens and developed a molecular evolutionary concept how changes in the repertoires of plant immune sensors and pathogen effectors enable host range expansions, including host jumps. More recently, I am interested in identifying principles underlying the ability of plants to establish associations with microbial communities in the root. The model plant Arabidopsis is used for these studies that are beginning to reveal complex interactions between microbial soil life and root functions.As a geneticist and biochemist, I have studied molecular principles underlying the innate immune system of plants.

VProfessor Seager is interested in the search for and identification of Earth-like exoplanets and signs of life on habitable worlds. To that end her work focuses on exoplanet atmospheres and biosignature gases, gases produced by life that might accumulate in an exoplanet atmosphere and be remotely detected by a space telescope. Seager has worked on exoplanet atmospheres since the first discovery of giant exoplanets orbiting sun-like stars in the mid 1990s. Her early work founded many of the original concepts now standard in the field, most notably transmission spectra of transiting planets, work which led to the first detection of an exoplanet atmosphere. Her team later introduced other fundamental exoplanet characterization topics, including atmospheric retrieval, brightness variability of terrestrial planets, and a critical discriminator to discovering transiting exoplanets. Her team is currently focused on an exhaustive list of potential biosignature gases in light of false positives for different exoplanet environments. Prof. Seager is involved with many space missions to find and characterize exoplanets, as a PI on ASTERIA, a prototype for a concept for a fleet of nanosatellites, a co-I on the MIT-led NASA mission TESS, and a past chair of the NASA Probe-Class Starshade Rendezvous mission study.Professor Seager is interested in the search for and identification of Earth-like exoplanets and signs of life on habitable worlds.

VI study active earthquake and volcanic process through data collection, inversion, and continuum mechanics modeling. Using sensors such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) my students and I are able to measure deformation of the earth\u2019s surface in space and time and invert these data for the geometry of faults and magma chambers, and spatiotemporal variations in fault slip-rate and magma chamber dilation. In seismically active areas, measurements of strain accumulation, together with appropriate mechanical models of fault systems, are used to place constraints on future seismic hazard. In volcanic areas, magma rising through the earth\u2019s crust also deforms the earth surface in ways that can be used to constrain eruptive potential. We use these observational constraints to develop and test physical models of active plate boundaries such as the San Andreas Fault, and the Cascade subduction zone, the nucleation of earthquakes, slow slip events, and the physics of magma migration leading to volcanic eruptions. I have also analyzed pore-fluid effects on faulting, and shown that poro-elastic stressing can explain earthquakes induced by fluid extraction.I study active earthquake and volcanic process through data collection, inversion, and continuum mechanics modeling.

VI am interested in exploring physical phenomena through optics, searching for ideas that are universal to all wave systems in nature. My research interests are mainly in physical optics, quantum electronics, nonlinear optics, solitons, sub-wavelength imaging and lasers. Among my most significant contributions are (chronologically) the discoveries of photorefractive solitons, of incoherent solitons (solitons made of incoherent white light from an incandescent bulb), the first observation of 2D lattice solitons, the first experimental demonstration of Anderson localization in a disordered periodic system, the discovery of hyper-transport (transport faster than ballistic) of waves in a spatially-random potential that fluctuates in time, demonstrating the first photonic topological insulator, and the co-invention of the concept of sparsity-based subwavelength imaging and super-resolution.  The current activity within my group is in several areas: (1) Topological Photonics and Photonic Topological Insulators, (2) Light and Disorder (Anderson localization of light & Hyper-transport), (3) Light in Subwavelength Structures, (4) Light in curved-space settings inspired by General Relativity, (5) Structure-based Subwavelength Imaging, and Super-resolution in Time, Frequency, and Quantum Systems, and (6) Complex Opto-Fluidics. Beyond these current topics, we are interested more generally in new ideas in the broad subjects associated with the dynamics of waves.I am interested in exploring physical phenomena through optics, searching for ideas that are universal to all wave systems in nature.

VThe Sehgal laboratory is interested in the genetic and cellular underpinnings of sleep:wake behavior. They study the circadian timing of sleep:wake, and related physiological processes, and also seek to address how and why the need for sleep is generated. Using a Drosophila model, the laboratory has identified circadian clock genes, elucidated mechanisms by which these genes function together to generate an endogenous clock and by which they synchronize the clock to light, and discovered pathways that transmit signals from the clock and produce overt behavioral rhythms. They have also addressed the role of clocks in peripheral (non-brain) tissues in Drosophila as well as mammals. To understand the mechanisms that determine sleep need, and thereby sleep amount and quality, Sehgal and her collaborators established Drosophila as a model system to study the homeostatic regulation of sleep. They have identified genes and neural circuits that control sleep amount, linked sleep loss to behavioral and metabolic changes and pinpointed a function for sleep in early life.The Sehgal laboratory is interested in the genetic and cellular underpinnings of sleep:wake behavior.

VThe long-range goal of my research is to build linking principles from brain to behavior using computational models. Starting with relatively simple models of neural networks and learning algorithms, I demonstrated that they nonetheless had powerful computational capabilities. A combination of theoretical and experimental approaches in my laboratory ranging from biophysical models of single synapses and neurons to dynamic network models were then used to explore a wide range of neural systems. The central issues being addressed are how dendrites integrate synaptic signals in neurons, how neural circuits generate behavior, and how learning and sleep adaptively modify these circuits. In particular, neural model were proposed for how dopamine neurons predict future rewards, how songbirds learn their songs, how sleep spindles are generated in the thalamus, and how fluctuating synpatic inputs give rise to reliable patterns in spike trains. Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive interneurons are currently the focus of both computational and experimental studies of attention in the visual cortex and dysfunction in schizophrenia. Synapses are explored with Monte Carlo methods (MCell) and brain activity is analyzed with the independent components analysis (ICA).The long-range goal of my research is to build linking principles from brain to behavior using computational models.

VMy first significant piece of work is the result that a finitely generated projective module in the polynomial ring in two variables over a field is free,(the first progress in a conjecture of Serre, which was settled later by Quillen and independently Suslin). A substantial part of my work is in the field of \u005cmoduli of vector bundles" and is inspired by the work of Andrre Weil and David Mumford. It gives, in particular, the basic constructions of the \u005cmoduli spaces" of vector bundles on curves. They are projective varieties and their underlying topological spaces are given by unitary representations of the fundamental group of the curve. The latter is joint work with M.S.Narasimhan and marked the beginning of all this work. For the construction of these moduli spaces in arbitrary characteristic, one needs a conjecture of Mumford on representations of semi-simple groups. I proved this conjecture for the linear group GL(2). Subsequently, I gave a quotient space approach to solve this conjecture and a key idea in this method led to an ampleness criterion for line bundles on projective varieties and led to what are called \u005cSeshadri constants". The conjecture was settled later by Haboush and recently I perceive that my quotient space approach can be made to work. My work on Standard Monomial Theory (SMT) is inspired by a classical work of Hodge and aims to give nice bases of finite dimensional representations of semi-simple groups and more generally of sections of \u005cdominant" line bundles on \u005cSchubert varieties". SMT gives a character formula which is, in spirit, quite diferent from the Weyl character formula and provides a tool for the geometric study of Schubert varieties. I succeeded in doing this only for the classical groups (most of my work is in collaboration with V. Lakshmibai and C. Musili) and later Peter Littelmann succeeded in doing it for any semi-simple group.My first significant piece of work is the result that a finitely generated projective module in the polynomial ring in two variables over a field is free,(the first progress in a conjecture of Serre, which was settled later by Quillen and independently Suslin).

VThe overarching objective of Karen Seto\u2019s research is to understand the links among urbanization, global change, and sustainability. Using a combination of satellite remote sensing, socioeconomic and biophysical data, field research, and modeling methods, her work focuses on four themes: 1) measuring and characterizing urban land-use and its spatial structure; 2) modeling and understanding the drivers of urban land-use change; 3) forecasting urban expansion; and 4) assessing the environmental consequences of urban expansion. Her work is notable for its systematic use of big data and a scientific lens to study urbanization as a process and to understand the aggregate global impacts of urbanization. Seto\u2019s research has generated new insights on the interaction between urbanization and food systems, the effects of urban expansion on biodiversity and cropland loss, urban energy use and emissions, and urban mitigation of climate change.The overarching objective of Karen Seto\u2019s research is to understand the links among urbanization, global change, and sustainability.

They have used field playback experiments to explore monkeys\u2019 vocal communication and its relation to cognition, with a particular focus on the monkeys\u2019 understanding of call meaning and their knowledge of each other\u2019s social relationships. Their research has also considered how social relationships and social cognition contribute to fitness. More recent papers explore what the study of nonhuman primate communication and cognition might tell us about the early precursors of human language.

VMy research focuses on the development of massively parallel computer architectures and algorithms for high-speed biomolecular simulations, and the application of such simulations to basic scientific research and computer-aided drug design. In particular, my colleagues and I have developed a special-purpose supercomputer, called Anton, that executes atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations of proteins about two orders of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art. The machine has allowed us to observe the behavior of proteins on timescales at which a number of biologically important phenomena occur, including the process of "protein folding," the structural changes underlying molecular signaling within the cell, and the binding of drug molecules to their biological targets.My research focuses on the development of massively parallel computer architectures and algorithms for high-speed biomolecular simulations, and the application of such simulations to basic scientific research and computer-aided drug design.

VShectman's current research is centered primarily on the search for extrasolar planets by making precise measurements of the periodic variation of the Doppler shift of the parent star, and on the design of instrumentation for large telescopes. Using a temperature-controlled, high-resolution spectrograph installed on the Magellan telescopes in Chile, in conjunction with an iodine absorption cell, Shectman and his collaborators achieve a long-term precision of about 1 meter/sec rms. Such observations require high signal-to-noise ratio and low sytematic error, because the intrinsic FWHM of the absorption lines in stellar spectra is typically about 5 km/s. For comparison a distant observer measuring the Doppler shift of the Sun would measure velocity variations with an amplitude of 12 m/s due the planet Jupiter, while the effect of the Earth at 0.1 m/s would be swamped by noise from intrinsic stellar variations, for example from turbulence in the solar photosphere or from sunspots. Most instruments on large telescopes are built to work in the seeing-limited regime, where the final image size is the result of atmospheric turbulence rather than the diffraction limit of the telescope. In this case the size of optical instruments, for example spectrographs with diffraction gratings, focussing optics and large-area detector arrays, scales directly with the aperture of the telescope. For large and extremely-large telescopes the challenge of building useful instruments with optical elements of practical size becomes acute. Shectman has designed a number of variations of wide-field spectrographs, which can be used to take spectra of many objects in the telescope field of view at the same time, as well as single-object high-resolution spectrographs. Some of these instruments have been implemented for use on the Magellan telescopes in Chile, while others are intended as design studies for the future generation of extremely-large telescopes.Shectman's current research is centered primarily on the search for extrasolar planets by making precise measurements of the periodic variation of the Doppler shift of the parent star, and on the design of instrumentation for large telescopes.

VDr. Shen's main research interest lies in the area of condensed matter physics, with a focus on emerging phenomena in quantum materials, including superconductors, quantum magnets, and topological phases of matter.  He develops photon based experimental probes, ranging from angle-resolved photoemission, soft x-ray scattering, time domain spectroscopy/scattering, microwave imaging, and matching them with outstanding problems in novel materials.  Using high energy and momentum resolution photoemission spectroscopy, he showed that the energy gap of high temperature superconductors is highly anisotropic, consistent with an unconventional d-wave pairing symmetry.  Further, the same technique reveals another surprising energy gap above the superconducting transition temperature.  The analysis on the resemblance and distinction of these gaps reveals an intertwined relationship between superconductivity and its neighboring states in the electronic phase diagram, which serves as a key ingredient for microscopic theory.  More recently, his focus is on the complete mapping of all relevant quantum degrees of freedom that are important to microscopic understanding of emerging properties in complex materials - energy, momentum, spin, orbital, space and time.   He has expanded his interest to a wider range of materials, including atomically thin films by in-situ synthesis methods.  He has also developed an interest in the applications of materials and scientific instrumentation.Dr. Shen's main research interest lies in the area of condensed matter physics, with a focus on emerging phenomena in quantum materials, including superconductors, quantum magnets, and topological phases of matter.  He develops photon based experimental probes, ranging from angle-resolved photoemission, soft x-ray scattering, time domain spectroscopy/scattering, microwave imaging, and matching them with outstanding problems in novel materials.  Using high energy and momentum resolution photoemission spectroscopy, he showed that the energy gap of high temperature superconductors is highly anisotropic, consistent with an unconventional d-wave pairing symmetry.  Further, the same technique reveals another surprising energy gap above the superconducting transition temperature.  The analysis on the resemblance and distinction of these gaps reveals an intertwined relationship between superconductivity and its neighboring states in the electronic phase diagram, which serves as a key ingredient for microscopic theory.  More recently, his focus is on the complete mapping of all relevant quantum degrees of freedom that are important to microscopic understanding of emerging properties in complex materials - energy, momentum, spin, orbital, space and time.   He has expanded his interest to a wider range of materials, including atomically thin films by in-situ synthesis methods.  He has also developed an interest in the applications of materials and scientific instrumentation.Dr. Shen's main research interest lies in the area of condensed matter physics, with a focus on emerging phenomena in quantum materials, including superconductors, quantum magnets, and topological phases of matter.  He develops photon based experimental probes, ranging from angle-resolved photoemission, soft x-ray scattering, time domain spectroscopy/scattering, microwave imaging, and matching them with outstanding problems in novel materials.  Using high energy and momentum resolution photoemission spectroscopy, he showed that the energy gap of high temperature superconductors is highly anisotropic, consistent with an unconventional d-wave pairing symmetry.  Further, the same technique reveals another surprising energy gap above the superconducting transition temperature.  The analysis on the resemblance and distinction of these gaps reveals an intertwined relationship between superconductivity and its neighboring states in the electronic phase diagram, which serves as a key ingredient for microscopic theory.  More recently, his focus is on the complete mapping of all relevant quantum degrees of freedom that are important to microscopic understanding of emerging properties in complex materials - energy, momentum, spin, orbital, space and time.   He has expanded his interest to a wider range of materials, including atomically thin films by in-situ synthesis methods.  He has also developed an interest in the applications of materials and scientific instrumentation.

They explored the perturbative and nonperturbative dynamics of string theory. In particular they gave nonperturbative definitions of low dimensional string theories, uncovering intrinsically stringy nonperturbative effects.

VUsing X-ray crystallography and a variety of complementary biophysical and biochemical methods, Shi studies the molecular mechanisms of several key classes of proteins that execute apoptosis, a form of cell death that plays essential roles in the development of multi-cellular organisms and in preventing diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. The execution of apoptosis is evolutionarily conserved among metazoans, culminating in activation of a cascade of cell-killing intracellular proteases known as caspases. Over the past 16 years, Shi pursued mechanistic understanding of caspase regulation in mammalian as well as fruit fly and worm systems. His laboratory has examined how caspases are activated by upstream activating complexes (apoptosome), how they are inhibited by inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), and how the inhibition is derepressed by Smac-like proteins. Shi is also interested in mechanistic understanding of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). He has examined the structures of all three known classes of intramembrane proteases: rhomboid-like serine protease, S2P metalloprotease, and a presenilin-like aspartate protease. Finally, as a biophysicist, Shi is fascinated by ATP-powered macromolecular machineries and small molecule transport across the cell membrane.Using X-ray crystallography and a variety of complementary biophysical and biochemical methods, Shi studies the molecular mechanisms of several key classes of proteins that execute apoptosis, a form of cell death that plays essential roles in the development of multi-cellular organisms and in preventing diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.

VI have studied major transitions in the history of vertebrate life using expeditionary paleontology and neontology, namely experimental developmental biology and comparative morphology of extant species. Working in Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks worldwide, my colleagues and I have uncovered early fossil evidence for key groups of extant amphibians, mammals, as well as species that are transitional between finned fish and limbed tetrapod. Developmental approaches, using the tools of experimental embryology and developmental genetics, have revealed the antecedents of limb development in diverse skeletal organs of fish and sharks. These approaches have revealed transitional stages in the evolution of skeletal patterns and the developmental mechanisms underlying their formation.I have studied major transitions in the history of vertebrate life using expeditionary paleontology and neontology, namely experimental developmental biology and comparative morphology of extant species.

VMy research program is focused on defining adaptations that enable intracellular parasites to gain entry into their host cells, avoid host defenses, and establish a replicative niche. Using Toxoplasma gondii as a model system, we have defined parasite-mediated mechanisms that control host-cell entry and egress, and that mediate tissue migration during parasite dissemination in the host. Together with an extensive group of international collaborators, we have explored genetic diversity and defined the global population structure of this widespread parasite of warm-blooded vertebrates including humans. We have developed a variety of genetic strategies to compare phenotypic differences between natural isolates and to define the molecular basis of pathogenesis. These studies demonstrate that pathogenesis determinants act by altering host gene expression, blocking signaling pathways, and subverting immune responses. Our findings have uncovered novel and essential aspects of parasite biology that provide opportunities for developing new therapies for animal and human diseases.My research program is focused on defining adaptations that enable intracellular parasites to gain entry into their host cells, avoid host defenses, and establish a replicative niche.

VWorkers in Fred Sigworth's laboratory have studied the kinetics and structural basis of conformational changes in ion channel proteins. In the period 1985-2000 they exploited single-channel recordings and statistical analyses to examine mechanisms of coupling of ligand binding and membrane potential changes to the open-close transitions of channels. In subsequent years the laboratory has focused increasingly on single-particle cryo-EM methods to study the structure of ion channels, along the way contributing to the mathematics of single-particle reconstruction. At present the main project in the laboratory is the single-particle imaging of voltage-gated channels under conditions where membrane potentials are imposed.Workers in Fred Sigworth's laboratory have studied the kinetics and structural basis of conformational changes in ion channel proteins.

VFred Sigworth is a biophysicist who is interested in the function and structure of ion channel proteins. He grew up in Orinda, California and studied Applied Physics at Caltech, receiving the B.S. degree in 1974. He subsequently worked on noise analysis of ion channel currents under Charles F. Stevens, and received the Ph.D. in Physiology from Yale University in 1979. Soon after he arrived in Göttingen as a postdoc in 1980, his mentor Erwin Neher made the seminal discovery of tight-seal patch-clamp recordings of ion channel currents. Sigworth developed sensitive amplifiers for recording the small currents, and statistical techniques for analyzing the single-molecule events underlying the time courses of currents. He returned to Yale as a faculty member in 1984, where he has continued to study voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels, first by patch-clamp recording and more recently by single-particle cryo-EM techniques. He is currently a professor in Yale's Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology with joint appointments in Biomedical Engineering and Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry.

VRobert Siliciano and his wife Janet Siliciano lead a laboratory that is focused in finding a cure for HIV infection. Following the lab\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a latent reservoir for HIV, they demonstrated that latently infected cells persist indefinitely even in patients on prolonged antiretroviral therapy (ART). These studies indicated that eradication of HIV-1 infection with ART alone would never be possible. The lab is now focused on understanding the in vivo dynamics of this reservoir, specifically the factors that account for the remarkable stability of the reservoir. The lab is also working to identify drugs that will reactivate latent HIV so that it can be targeted by the immune system, and to develop accurate, scalable assays that can be used to evaluate curative interventions. In addition, the lab has studied theoretical aspects of the pharmacodynamics of antiretroviral drugs in an effort to understand the remarkable ability of these drugs to block HIV replication.Robert Siliciano and his wife Janet Siliciano lead a laboratory that is focused in finding a cure for HIV infection.

VDr. Singer seeks to follow the expression and movement of mRNA from transcription through degradation in live cells. He develops methods to label RNA in fixed and living cells using fluorescent probes and the microscopy techniques and image analysis algorithms to visualize and quantify many mRNAs simultaneously. Using these technologies, he can observe single mRNAs as they are transcribed and processed, as they export from the nucleus, localize to cytoplasmic compartments such as dendritic processes of neurons, and finally when and where they translate and are degraded. Because these techniques yield quantitative fluorescence data, mathematical modeling can be applied to test mechanistic hypotheses about the kinetics of each of the events in an mRNA's life. By making transgenic, knock-in mice where the endogenous RNA is tagged with the stem loops of the MS2 phage, and bound to the cognate fluorescent coat protein, these events can be seen in living tissues, in order to ultimately understand the native regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression.Dr. Singer seeks to follow the expression and movement of mRNA from transcription through degradation in live cells.

VWolf Singer´s laboratory is interested in the neuronal underpinnings of higher cognitive functions such as perception, attention and consciousness, using the mammalian visual system as model for investigation. Experimental approaches comprise analysis of neuronal activity at different scales associated with the performance of cognitive tasks in behaviorally trained monkeys, healthy human subjects and patients with psychiatric conditions. Studies focus on the questions how the distributed sub-processes cooperating in cognitive acts are bound together and how stored knowledge is combined with sensory evidence for the construction of percepts. The core assumption is that these operations are performed in the temporal domain and rely on the high dimensional dynamics provided by the recurrent networks of the cerebral cortex. Multisite recordings suggest synchronization of oscillatory activity as one prominent mechanism for the dynamic association of neuronal responses, the coordination of distributed processes and the matching of sensory evidence with stored priors. In patients suffering from schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, oscillatory patterning and synchronization of neuronal responses are impaired, the impairment reflecting severity of clinical symptoms.Wolf Singer´s laboratory is interested in the neuronal underpinnings of higher cognitive functions such as perception, attention and consciousness, using the mammalian visual system as model for investigation.

The research in population genetics is in several areas. One is on models that account for geographic patterns in gene frequencies in natural populations. This research examines the balance achieved between gene flow, genetic drift and natural selection. Part of this work involves modeling the effects of recent range expansions on patterns of geographic variation. Another area of research is on models of polygenic characters and complex inherited diseases that have a polygenic basis, with particular emphasis on determining how important are epistatic interactions among genes. A third area of research is on interpreting DNA sequencies obtained from fossils and using those sequences to infer past episodes of admixture and natural selection. Slatkin\u2019s group has been part of the Neanderthal Genome Consortium and has collaborated on the analysis of ancient DNA from other mammalian populations including polar bears, cave bears, mammoths and mastodons.Montgomery Slatkin\u2019s laboratory has been involved in research primarily on mathematical population genetics, but also on mathematical models in phylogenetics, epidemiology and ecology.

VI have studied the psychology of risk and decision making for more than half a century. My earliest studies examined choices among simple gambles. I later began to study society\u2019s complex gambles associated with natural disasters, technology, medicine, and violence. My current research examines the interaction between two fundamental ways in which human beings comprehend risk. Analytic thinking uses algorithms and normative rules, such as the probability calculus, formal logic, and risk assessment. It is relatively slow, effortful, and requires conscious control. Experiential thinking is intuitive, fast, often automatic, and not very accessible to conscious awareness. Experiential thinking enabled human beings to survive during their long period of evolution and remains today the most natural and most common way to respond to risk. It relies on images and associations, linked by experience to emotion and affect. It represents risk as a feeling that tells us whether it\u2019s safe to walk down this dark street or drink this strange-smelling water. Such feelings are an important guide to risk-taking behavior and, like visual perceptions they are typically fast, accurate, and rational. Yet, also like perceptions, our feelings systematically fail us in certain important situations. My research describes these failings and ways to overcome them in the face of risks as diverse as cigarette smoking and large scale natural and human caused disasters.I have studied the psychology of risk and decision making for more than half a century.

VDouglas Soltis\u2019 laboratory has diverse research interests in plant biology and evolution. He studies plant evolution using DNA approaches; interests include building the tree of life for all organisms, flowering plant evolution, genome doubling (polyploidy), and conservation genetics. Soltis has reconstructed relationships among all major lineages of flowering plants. With other researchers he has proposed a new classification for angiosperms. He is working with colleagues to build the tree of life of China. At a larger scale, Soltis is part of a group that built the first-draft tree of life for all of the 2.3 million named species on Earth. He and others revealed that Amborella is sister to all other living angiosperms (the duck-billed platypus of flowering plants) and helped lead the effort to provide the complete genome sequence of Amborella as a reference genome for flowering plants. Soltis and collaborators also revealed that numerous ancient polyploidy events have occurred throughout angiosperm history. He has also developed the sunflowering genus Tragopogon as a model for the study of recent and recurrent genome doubling, revealing the rapid and dynamic nature of polyploid evolution.Douglas Soltis\u2019 laboratory has diverse research interests in plant biology and evolution.

VPamela S. Soltis and her lab study plant evolutionary biology. Her research is motivated by her passion for biodiversity, especially plants. She uses genomic and computational methods to understand patterns and processes of plant evolution. She and her colleagues were among the first to reconstruct large-scale phylogenetic trees for angiosperms (flowering plants), and she uses these trees and methods to address a range of questions in plant evolution and ecology. Through this work, they identified Amborella, a shrub from New Caledonia, as the sister group of all other living angiosperms, providing an important reference for comparative biology. The Amborella genome shows evidence of an ancient whole-genome duplication (polyploidy), which occurred prior to the origin of all flowering plants. Similar whole-genome duplications have occurred throughout angiosperm evolution and are often associated with bursts of speciation. Analysis of polyploid species that originated during the past century is identifying the key consequences of whole-genome duplication on chromosome structure, karyotypes, gene content, and gene expression. Polyploidy generates novelty and diversity at genetic, chromosomal, individual, and ecological levels. The diversity of plants is archived in the world\u2019s natural history collections, and these specimens offer untapped resources for molecular, evolutionary, and ecological analyses. Her ongoing work seeks to harness the power of these collections \u2013 both physical and digital \u2013 for novel research applications. She is particularly interested in linking heterogeneous data to gain new insight into plant evolution and to contribute to plant conservation.Pamela S.

VSpitzer's research interests have focused on the role of electrical activity in development and function of the nervous system. Investigation of the differentiation of neuronal excitability led to the discovery of calcium-dependent action potentials in embryonic spinal neurons and identified voltage-gated currents, channels, and channel genes that generate them. He and his colleagues discovered distinct classes of calcium transients in neuronal growth cones that regulate the rate of axon extension, adhesion and turning. Calcium-dependent action potentials and novel calcium entry mechanisms produce spontaneous transient elevations of intracellular calcium at low frequencies and exert their effects via a frequency code. The neurotransmitters neurons employ are fundamental determinants of nervous system function and the choice of neurotransmitter in the mature nervous system was thought to be irreversibly specified early in development. Spitzer and his laboratory demonstrated that changes in electrical activity rapidly and reversibly reconfigure the transmitters and corresponding transmitter receptors that neurons express, both in the developing nervous system and in the mature brain, modulating the transcriptional code for transmitter specification. He showed that induction of transmitter expression can be achieved by selective activation of afferents recruited by a physiological range of sensory input and that newly expressed transmitters regulate behavior.Spitzer's research interests have focused on the role of electrical activity in development and function of the nervous system.

VJonathan Sprent has broad interests in T cell immunology. In initial studies he characterized the lifespan and homing properties of naïve T and B cells. He demonstrated that exposing these cells to antigen in vivo caused both cell types to become trapped in sites of antigen localization followed by their release into the circulation in expanded numbers as effector cells. Later, he measured the lifespan and turnover of memory T cells and defined their stimulation by IFN I and their dependence on IL-15 and IL-7 for survival. For T cell development, he and others used bone marrow chimeras and thymus-grafting studies to define the development of immature T cells in the thymus and demonstrate that differentiation into mature lymphocytes involves a process of positive and negative selection to self peptides on MHC molecules expressed on cortical epithelial cells. For T cell activation, he showed that initial trapping of CD4 T-cells by antigen followed by proliferation and interaction with specific B cells reflected MHC-restricted interaction with APC; comparable MHC restriction applied to CD8 T-cells eliciting graft-versus-host disease to minor histocompatibility antigens. Currently, his interests have switched to devising new forms of cancer immunotherapy.Jonathan Sprent has broad interests in T cell immunology.

VI study the archaeological record as a comparative social and behavioral scientist. I want to know why, after successfully surviving as hunters and foragers for over 50 millennia with a fully modern evolved psychology, humans quickly settled in villages and towns to create complex social organizations in the early Holocene. This is fundamentally a question of how large-scale human political and economic cooperation evolved over a rapid period of time. This cultural evolutionary process occurred independently in several areas of the world indicating that exogenous factors underlie this process. My work in South America provides data at a millennial time scale to model the evolution of cooperation from small village societies to expansive state systems among human populations. This works points to the importance of ritualizing aspects of the domestic economy, intergroup conflict and resource patchiness as key exogenous factors in the evolution of complex cooperation in the archaeological record. This research, combined with comparable work from other areas of the world, allows us to model the evolution of human cooperation over the last ten millennia.I study the archaeological record as a comparative social and behavioral scientist.

These two \u2018dark\u2019 entities have remarkably similar qualitative properties, and may have either physical or geometrical nature, or both. He also works in the area of classical and quantum modified gravity and its applications to cosmology, black holes, singularities and global structure of curved space-time. Among more distant, but no less fundamental and ambitious aims is the search for observational tests of the history of our Universe at the beginning of inflation and before it (including a possible bounce), as well as tests of other post-inflationary universes (\u2018multiverse\u2019) which are outside our past light cone in the approximation of a quasi-classical space-time.At present Alexei Starobinsky is mainly interested in the investigation of physical properties of primordial dark energy which triggered a quasi-de Sitter (inflationary) stage in the early Universe, including details of its decay resulting in the transition from this stage to the hot Big Bang, as well as of properties of present dark energy which energy density dominates the Universe now, using numerous existing and expected observational data.

VMy research interests span a broad spectrum of ecological and evolutionary topics, most of which are rooted in population biology. Before the early 1990s, much of my work was purely theoretical. Later, I have adopted the research strategy of 'asking' available data what the underlying ecological or evolutionary process might most likely be - all within a theoretical perspective. Variations in population densities in time and space - and the underlying demographic processes - have been a main interest of mine over the years. An important example is the interdependent relation between density-dependent and density-independent processes, where the ecological effect of climate is an important example of the latter.Most of my work relates to basic issues. However, I find great pleasure in working on more applied issues as well; I have never been ashamed of my research being of practical use here and now. These applied interests have brought me into work on pest control (e.g., rodents in Africa), harvesting (marine and terrestrial), bio-economics (e.g., the ecological dynamics of dry-land pastoral systems) and epidemiology (Plague).I am convinced that it is helpful to try to understand what has happened in the past, in preparing for what might happen in the future, e.g., ecological and evolutionary effects of climate change. For this reason, I value the existence of long-term time series - and the analysis of them.My research interests span a broad spectrum of ecological and evolutionary topics, most of which are rooted in population biology.

VStoddart is one of a small number of chemists who have played a major role, during the past quarter of century, in creating a new field of chemistry wherein the mechanical bond is a pre-eminent component of chemical compounds and a determining feature in defining their properties. Research carried out in the Stoddart Group into the nature of noncovalent bonds, as they express themselves in molecular recognition and self-assembly processes, has led to the introduction of a number of highly efficient template-directed synthetic protocols for the construction of two-state mechanically interlocked molecules\u2014namely, bistable catenanes and bistable rotaxanes\u2014that have been used in the production of artificial molecular switches, machines and motors. The switches, which can be activated chemically, electrochemically or photochemically, have found applications in areas ranging from molecular electronics to drug delivery systems. The machines and motors, which are designed to function away from equilibrium, are being employed in the syntheses and characterization of molecular elevators and pumps that perform work repetitively and progressively.Stoddart is one of a small number of chemists who have played a major role, during the past quarter of century, in creating a new field of chemistry wherein the mechanical bond is a pre-eminent component of chemical compounds and a determining feature in defining their properties.

VMy research focuses on the analysis of genetic data to investigate population history and adaptation in humans, other animals, and pathogens. I am particularly interested in adaptation in the context of disease and diet which have been particularly important over the course of human evolution. Specifically, my research has had three main foci: (a) Native American population history, (b) the evolutionary biology of the Great Apes, and (c) understanding the evolutionary history of pathogens (specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. leprae, the causative agents of tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively) in humans and other animals. In order to address questions about these topics, my students, collaborators, and I analyze DNA from ancient and modern samples. Such analyses have allowed us to evaluate demographic changes through time, assess the impacts of geography and language on genetic variation, estimate divergence times, and examine the signatures and impacts of selection in genomes.My research focuses on the analysis of genetic data to investigate population history and adaptation in humans, other animals, and pathogens.

VHoward Stone's research interests are in fluid dynamics, especially as they arise in research and applications in transport phenomena at the interface of engineering, chemistry, physics, biology and applied mathematics. He has developed original research directions in the area of complex fluids and microfluidics including studies and applications involving bubbles and droplets, red blood cells, bacteria, chemical kinetics, etc. Many of the studies involve experiments, theory and numerical simulations. For example, his research group made fundamental contributions to droplet microfluidics and to microfluidic flows involving narrow regions where reaction-diffusion processes are localized. In addition, his group has made various contributions to flow processes involving foams. Also, in biologically inspired areas, his research group identified conditions where fluid flow causes surface-attached biofilms to form three-dimensional filaments inside the flow. He has studied biophysics transport and mechanics problems involving lipid bilayers. His general interests in complex fluids often lead him to seek collaborations with scientists in different disciplines.Howard Stone's research interests are in fluid dynamics, especially as they arise in research and applications in transport phenomena at the interface of engineering, chemistry, physics, biology and applied mathematics.

VThe essential B-vitamins folate, vitamin B12 and riboflavin function in a metabolic network known as one-carbon metabolism, which is essential for the faithful replication of the genome and maintenance of genome stability. It is also required for the provision of activated methyl groups for cellular methylation reactions. Aberrations in one-carbon metabolism, due to interactions among nutrition and common gene variants, are tightly linked to several common human pathologies. The Stover research group investigates the fundamental chemical, biochemical, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and the associated pathways within the one-carbon metabolic network, that underlie the relationships among nutrition, metabolism and risk for birth defects, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. A primary focus of our research is to understand the regulation of folate cofactor partitioning among the anabolic pathways within the metabolic network, and the role of this regulation in disease etiology. We have demonstrated that the folate-dependent de novo thymidylate biosynthesis pathway enzymes undergo SUMO-dependent translocation to the nucleus at S-phase, and form a multienzyme complex that generates thymidylate at sites of DNA synthesis within the nucleus of mammalian cells. Mild impairments in nuclear dTMP synthesis, as observed in SHMT1+/- mice, sensitizes mice to folate-responsive neural tube defects, colon cancer and neurodegeneration. Our continuing research is revealing the causal role of nuclear dTMP synthesis in folate- and vitamin B12 responsive pathologies, and informing novel nutritional strategies for the prevention and management human pathologies.The essential B-vitamins folate, vitamin B12 and riboflavin function in a metabolic network known as one-carbon metabolism, which is essential for the faithful replication of the genome and maintenance of genome stability.

Early work focused on chemical cues that regulate the foraging of parasitoid wasps, and life history traits that affect clutch size and sex ratio biology. The laboratory thereafter shifted emphasis to studying molecular mechanisms of host immune defense and counterstrategies by parasites for evading or suppressing host defense responses. This includes studies of microbial mutualists that either play essential roles in host defense or parasite virulence. In recent years, his laboratory in conjunction with collaborators has studied the endocrine regulation of mosquito reproduction, and the role the gut microbiota plays in mosquito development. This has led to identification of several genes and molecules with essential functions in egg production and larval growth. Overall, research in the laboratory is strongly integrative and spans the fields of genomics, development, immunology, microbiology, ecology, and evolution.

VCooperative alliances are a central feature of life, and include multicellular organisms, social insects, mutualisms, and many microbial systems. Using social insects and later social microbes, Strassmann and her long-time collaborator David Queller, have explored how these alliances come to be, what makes them stable, and how conflict is controlled. She pioneered the use of DNA microsatellite markers to get at the intricacies of within-colony genetic relatedness in social wasps and stingless bees and showed that kin selection offered explanations for where cooperation occurs and how conflict is controlled. She then moved on to study altruism in social amoebae and used single gene knockouts, experimental evolution, genomics, and staged interactions to get at the molecular underpinnings of cooperation and to show the importance of genetic relatedness in favoring altruism in this system. Most recently they have discovered symbioses between social amoebae and bacteria in an agricultural mutualism. She is beginning to apply these concepts and techniques to understanding the origins and maintenance of cooperative entities we call organisms and the very nature of organismality.Cooperative alliances are a central feature of life, and include multicellular organisms, social insects, mutualisms, and many microbial systems.

VThe fundamental laws of nature, as we currently understand them, are both incomplete and self-contradictory. Unsolved problems include the unification of forces and particles, the origin of the universe and the quantum structure of black holes and event horizons. Professor Strominger's research has endeavored to shed light on these problems using a variety of approaches. The emergence of string theory as a potential unified theory of nature began with Strominger's co-discovery of Calabi-Yau compactifications(1). This construction demonstrated that string theory not only reconciles quantum mechanics and gravity, but can also contain within it electrons, protons, photons and all the other observed particles and forces, and hence is a viable candidate for a complete unified theory of nature. Strominger co-discovered the brane solutions of string theory(2), and subsequently used them to unravel the intricate and beautiful duality symmetries of the theory. The branes were eventually used by Strominger and collaborators to give a microscopic demonstration of how black holes are able to holographically store information(3); resolving a deep paradox uncovered by Hawking and Bekenstein a quarter century earlier. He and coworkers also used the branes to derive new relations in algebraic geometry, equating the moduli space of a brane in a Calabi-Yau space to the mirror Calabi-Yau4, and relating the Donaldson-Thomas to the Gromov-Witten invariants.(5)The fundamental laws of nature, as we currently understand them, are both incomplete and self-contradictory.

VFor many years, I have been interested in the molecular mechanisms of gene regulation in the baker's yeast.  This work includes the elucidation of the critical DNA sequences and proteins involved in how a gene is expressed at different levels depending on environmental conditions.  The gene expression process is a highly complex process involving an intricate interplay of the basic transcription machinery that synthesizes messenger RNA, DNA-binding transcription factors that are primarily responsible for gene-specific behavior, and multi-protein co-regulatory complexes that enzymatically modify chromatin, the protein-DNA substrate in living cells.  I have been interested in epigenetic inheritance, a molecular memory mechanism in which distinct stable states of gene expression are maintained or interchanged with the same genetic information.  In addition, I have been interested in using evolutionary approaches to distinguish between biological function and biological noise in the context of gene regulation.

VMichael Summers' laboratory uses NMR methods to study the structural determinants and mechanisms of retroviral genome packaging and virus assembly. They have determined the 3D structures of all of the major structural proteins of HIV-1, and have identified novel mechanisms for inhibiting the virus by zinc-ejecting and capsid-binding small molecules. Current studies focus on understanding how the matrix domain of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein protein and it\u2019s interactions with cellular constituents regulates the targeting of Gag to assembly sites on the plasma membrane. A major emphasis also focuses on developing NMR approaches to study relatively large RNAs (up to ~700 nucleotides), enabling structural studies of the 5´-leader of the HIV-1 genome. The 350-nucleotide HIV-1 leader, the most conserved region of the viral genome, regulates early- and late-phase RNA-dependent replication activities by what appears to be a structure-dependent mechanism. Recent NMR studies have led to understanding of how unspliced dimeric genomes, but not the highly abundant spliced viral mRNAs, are specifically and efficiently selected for packaging during virus assembly. Ongoing studies of Gag:5´-leader RNA interactions are aimed at providing structural insights into the ribonucleoprotein complex that is trafficked to the plasma membrane and nucleates virus assembly.Michael Summers' laboratory uses NMR methods to study the structural determinants and mechanisms of retroviral genome packaging and virus assembly.

The laboratory also studies the cellular roles of the ESCRT pathway in the cytokinesis and its regulation by the abscission checkpoint. We are particularly interested in understanding how the ESCRT machinery catalyzes the membrane fission reactions required for virus budding and cell division. Experimental approaches include NMR, EM, and crystallographic studies of viral complexes, biochemical analyses of the interactions between viral components and their cellular partners, and genetic and cell biological studies of protein functions.Wes Sundquist's laboratory studies the molecular and structural biology of retroviruses, with particular emphasis on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  Projects in the laboratory focus on understanding the architecture and assembly of the viral particle, the mechanisms of intrinsic host cell defenses, and the process of virus budding.

VPaleoanthropology is a discipline which is comparatively data-poor, for example relative to research areas involving genomics or bioinformatics. Insights are gained from careful accumulation of fossils and contextual information, and from an accurate as possible reading of those partial evidences. Both are less obviously done than it may seem. My colleagues and I have promoted field research at the <1 to 2 Ma Konso sites that reveals aspects of the evolution of Australopithecus and Homo and the development of the Acheulean technological complex. We are also engaged in field work at the 7 to 9 Ma Chorora sites, which allows glimpses of primate evolution at a time period close to the ape-human divergence. Our investigations show that informative morphological evolution occurs unevenly temporally and across body parts, and differentially among lineages. My interests are to elucidate such evolutionary complexities, especially those relating to the adaptive patterns of Ardipithecus, Australopithecus and Homo, and the ape-human divergence.Paleoanthropology is a discipline which is comparatively data-poor, for example relative to research areas involving genomics or bioinformatics.

VOver the last ten years, the Svoboda lab has investigated the structure, function and plasticity of cortical circuits in behaving mice, mainly in the context of active tactile sensation. The cerebral cortex occupies more than 75% of our brains and it plays central roles in virtually all flexible and adaptive behaviors. The Svoboda laboratory\u2019s goal is to identify core principles underlying information processing in cortical circuits and related structures. They have measured how tactile information is represented in the somatosensory cortex on millisecond time scales and at the level of individual action potentials in defined cell types. They also investigate how movements are planned and executed by neural circuits of the motor cortex. The Svoboda lab is also developing new methods to interrogate neural function in intact brains. Notable contributions include microscopy methods to image synapses over long time scales in the intact brain; the development of sensitive fluorescent protein sensors for noninvasive imaging of neural activity; microscopes with very large fields of view that enable imaging multiple brain regions with single neurons resolution.Over the last ten years, the Svoboda lab has investigated the structure, function and plasticity of cortical circuits in behaving mice, mainly in the context of active tactile sensation.

VAs a systems neuroscientist I have studied the structural organization and molecular plasticity of mammalian brain networks underlying the three basic classes of motivated and emotional behaviors that assure the survival of all animals: ingestive (eating and drinking), defensive (fight or flight), and reproductive (sexual and parental). The first detailed model centered on the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and its role in controlling metabolism and eating behavior on the one hand, and body water and drinking behavior on the other. We have since characterized a hypothalamic-midbrain behavior control column at the top of the motor system hierarchy that also regulates defensive and reproductive (together social) behaviors, along with the exploratory or foraging behavior common to all of them. This analysis has also clarified the hypothalamic network responsible for coordinating appropriate behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine responses to a wide range of stimuli from the external and internal environments, from the cognitive system, and from the behavioral state control system. The lab is currently developing an online workbench for neural connectivity, and network tracing methods and strategies for determining systematically the entire wiring diagram or connectome of the mammalian nervous system.As a systems neuroscientist I have studied the structural organization and molecular plasticity of mammalian brain networks underlying the three basic classes of motivated and emotional behaviors that assure the survival of all animals: ingestive (eating and drinking), defensive (fight or flight), and reproductive (sexual and parental).

VThe main focus of my research is to bridge the gap between theory and experiment in biophysical chemistry.  Early in my carrier, I developed a model-free approach to the analysis of nuclear magnetic relaxation studies of macromolecules to learn about the nature of internal motions.  More recently, I have been developing the theory of both single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopic experiments. In the former, the problem is to describe how conformational dynamics influences the statistics of a string of photons emitted by a molecule.  In the latter, where, for example, a macromolecule is pulled apart by laser tweezers, one is interested in extracting the underlying free energy surfaces from such non-equilibrium experiments and the dependence of the rate of rupture on the applied force.  Recently, we found a model-free way of relating experiments performed at constant pulling velocity (where rupture force histograms are measured) and those performed at constant force (where rupture times are measured).The main focus of my research is to bridge the gap between theory and experiment in biophysical chemistry.

With the emergence of large and complex networks such as the Web or the Internet there is increasing need to analyze and design systems used by diverse and self-interested set of users. The focus of my work has been to design efficient algorithms, that find optimal or close to optimal solutions to problems motivated by a variety of applications ranging from transportation, social networks, and vision. My work in game theory is aimed at analyzing the outcomes of selfish behavior in networks, markets and other complex selfish systems, quantifying the efficiency loss due to the selfish behavior of the participant, and designing systems where selfish behavior results in close to optimal outcomes.I am a theoretical computer scientist working on algorithms, game theory, and networks.

VRichard Taylor is interested in the partly conjectural correspondence between Galois representations and automorphic forms. Whenever this dictionary, often called the Langlands correspondence, can be proved it provides an extremely powerful tool to answer questions about automorphic forms, Galois theory and L-functions. Taylor helped Wiles complete the proof of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem and, with Breuil, Conrad and Diamond, went on to prove the full Shimura-Taniyama conjecture. With Harris he prove the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n) and established its compatibility with known instances of the global correspondence. With Clozel, Harris and Shepherd-Barron he proved the Sato-Tate conjecture. Extending this method, together with Barnet-Lamb, Gee, Geraghty and Patrikis he proved the potential automorphy of all regular, self-dual motives, and hence established the meromorphic continuation of their L-functions. With Harris, Lan and Thorne he constructed Galois representations associated to all regular algebraic automorphic forms over CM fields.Richard Taylor is interested in the partly conjectural correspondence between Galois representations and automorphic forms.

VOver the past 25 years I have studied the molecular aspects of auxin perception and ethylene biosynthesis. These two plant hormones regulate various aspects of growth and development. My laboratory showed the primary mechanism of auxin is transcriptional activation. We characterized early auxin-regulated genes that proved to encode rapidly degraded transcriptional repressors that are the substrate of the auxin receptor TIR1 - one component of the SCF complex responsible for protein degradation and constituting central components of the auxin signaling apparatus. My laboratory was the first to clone ACC synthase (ACS), the key gene in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. Using antisense ACS RNA we constructed a tomato mutant unable to produce ethylene, which was instrumental in conclusively demonstrating that ethylene is indeed the fruit ripening hormone because of reversibility of the ripening process. This was the first successful demonstration of delaying plant senescence. Recent findings with loss of function ACS mutants revealed that ethylene-mediated processes in Arabidopsis are regulated by a combinatorial interplay among the ACS subunits, in a spatiotemporal manner. Lastly, my laboratory participated in the international effort to sequence the Arabidopsis genome, allowing development of new molecular tools providing new resources for the entire plant biology community.Over the past 25 years I have studied the molecular aspects of auxin perception and ethylene biosynthesis.

VThe aim of research in the Thesleff laboratory has been to understand the mechanisms regulating craniofacial development, in particular the formation and regeneration of teeth and other organs forming from the surface of the embryo such as hairs and glands. The focus is on signaling networks mediating intercellular communication and regulating patterns, numbers, sizes, and shapes of organs. The analysed conserved families of signal molecules include FGF, TGF\u03b2, Hedgehog, and Wnt as well as Ectodysplasin, a signal specifically required for ectodermal organ development. The main topic of research has been the development of teeth and their renewal from stem cells. The laboratory has developed ex vivo organ culture methods for studying roles of signaling molecules, and in vivo mouse models for elucidating functions of individual genes in development and regeneration. The mouse models also serve as models for human malformations, including congenital dental defects. Their analysis has increased the understanding of the genetic basis and pathogenesis of human syndromes such as ectodermal dysplasia, cleidocranial dysplasia, and tooth agenesis. The research may have clinical implications in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of congenital defects as well as in the design of regenerative therapies, such as bioengineering of teeth.The aim of research in the Thesleff laboratory has been to understand the mechanisms regulating craniofacial development, in particular the formation and regeneration of teeth and other organs forming from the surface of the embryo such as hairs and glands.

VJeremy Thorner's research at UC Berkeley has utilized budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model eukaryote in which to elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms in the organization, specificity, fidelity, and regulation of signal transduction processes. He has made path-finding contributions to our understanding of peptide hormone biogenesis and action, calcium ion and calcium-binding proteins, G protein-coupled receptors and the signaling cascades they initiate, mitogen-activated protein kinase modules and other protein kinase networks, and production and mobilization of phosphoinositides. He has also focused on the biochemical basis of the cellular responses evoked by these pathways. Of particular interest to him has been how extracellular stimuli control gene expression, cell growth and division, and cell differentiation, especially changes in membrane dynamics, cytoskeletal structure and cell morphology. The work carried out by his laboratory has always employed a productive blend of molecular genetics, biochemical analysis, and cell imaging methods. Furthermore, in these studies, Thorner's laboratory has demonstrated that the functions of the genes and gene products discovered first in yeast, a unicellular microbe, are highly conserved and thus have provided seminal understanding of biological processes that are broadly applicable to multicellular organisms, including humans.Jeremy Thorner's research at UC Berkeley has utilized budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as a model eukaryote in which to elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms in the organization, specificity, fidelity, and regulation of signal transduction processes.

VDr. Tishkoff studies genomic and phenotypic variation in ethnically diverse Africans. Her research combines field work, laboratory research, and computational methods to examine African population history and how genetic variation can affect a wide range of issues \u2013 for example, why humans have different susceptibility to disease, how they metabolize drugs, and how they adapt through evolution. Together with African collaborators, she has established an extensive collection of DNA and phenotype data from geographically and ethnically diverse Africans, many from populations never previously studied at the genetic level. Her studies demonstrate high levels of genomic diversity within and among ethnically diverse African populations and shed light on modern human origins as well as African population history. In addition, she has identified the genetic basis and evolutionary history of a number of adaptive traits including lactose tolerance in East African pastoralists, adaptation to high altitude in Ethiopians, genetic resistance to malaria infection in Africans, and the genetic basis of short stature in Central African rainforest hunter-gatherers.

VI study the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the Earth's global carbon cycle, with emphasis on quanitfying the magnitude and timing of their responses to land use and climate change.  This research addresses basic questions about how ecosystems function and applied questions about the role they will play in the carbon cycle of the next century.  As an isotope geochemist, my major contribution has been to use radiocarbon (14C) to infer the timescales of C exchange between the atmosphere, plants and soil organic matter. My collaborators and I have used cosmogenically produced 14C to determine the age of slow-growing trees that lack annual growth rings and to demonstrate a quantitative link between soil minerals and the age of stored soil carbon.  We trace the "bomb" 14C released to the atmosphere in the 1960s by atmospheric thermonuclear weapons testing through terrestrial C reservoirs to quantify the dynamics of C on decadal timescales.  Comparison of the rates of turnover in the context of soil forming factors are helping to unravel the short- and long-term controls on ecosystem C storage and dynamics.  Recently, we have used radiocarbon to partition sources of C lost from ecosystems as respiration or DOC by age, and to test hypotheses about the mechanisms for rapid destabilization of older organic matter stored in soil.I study the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the Earth's global carbon cycle, with emphasis on quanitfying the magnitude and timing of their responses to land use and climate change.

VUnderdal\u2019s contributions to the study of international cooperation has focused on three main aspects: diagnosing problems, assessing potential \u2018cures\u2019, and measuring regime effectiveness. In diagnosing problems, he has supplemented established political economy categories such as (global) collective goods with search for actors\u2019 \u2018private\u2019 interests and the distribution of political power.

VArild Underdal is a political scientist known primarily for his contributions to the study of international cooperation, with particular reference to environmental governance. In his doctoral dissertation, he examined regional fisheries management in the Northeast Atlantic and found a pattern close to what he called \u2018the law of the least ambitious program\u2019. Most of his subsequent research have tried to find ways to escape that \u2018law\u2019. Underdal was born in Bodø, Norway, and graduated with a \u2018magister\u2019 degree in political science from the University of Oslo (UiO) in 1972. In work on his doctoral dissertation he benefited significantly from a six months stay at (what was then) the Center for International Affairs, Harvard University, and another three months at the Institute for Marine Studies, University of Washington, Seattle. At the age of 34 he was elected Chair of the Department of Political Science. He has later served in a wide range of other leadership positions, including those of Vice Rector and Rector of the University of Oslo. Throughout much of his career he has been affiliated also with CICERO \u2013 Center for International Climate Research.Arild Underdal is a political scientist known primarily for his contributions to the study of international cooperation, with particular reference to environmental governance.

VMeg Urry\u2019s research centers on the structure of active galaxies, the growth of the supermassive black holes that power them, and the interplay of black hole growth with the evolution of its host galaxy. She studied the multi-wavelength variability of blazars, interpreting it in terms of particle acceleration and cooling in the blazar jets. One puzzle was the large number of known blazars relative to their most likely parent population, radio galaxies; she showed in a theoretical work that relativistic beaming strongly alters observed luminosity functions, and in a series of papers, quantitatively linked each of the two main blazar classes to the appropriate type of (unbeamed) radio galaxy. Urry and her collaborators used the multi-wavelength structures of extended jets to characterize their emission mechanisms. She surveyed the host galaxies of blazars, showing they were identical to galaxies without visible activity, supporting the idea that black hole growth is an episodic part of the evolution of every galaxy. Urry used X-ray plus infrared surveys to identify heavily obscured black holes, and showed that fully ¾ of rapidly growing black holes would be missed by normal optical selection. Most recently, she used morphological studies to show that only the most luminous active galaxies are triggered by violent mergers, and that most galaxies evolve slowly and secularly.Meg Urry\u2019s research centers on the structure of active galaxies, the growth of the supermassive black holes that power them, and the interplay of black hole growth with the evolution of its host galaxy.

VAs a physical/analytical chemist, I have studied the fundamental interactions of light with adsorbed molecules on metal surfaces that support surface plasmons. This area of research, now known as plasmonics, led to the discovery of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The key observable in SERS is the greatly amplified intensity of Raman scattering, as much as one billion times, when the localized surface plasmons resonances (LSPR) of Ag or Au nanoparticles are excited. Through detailed studies of the mechanism of SERS on structurally well-defined nanoparticles, it has been established that the enhancement of Raman scattering and, indeed, all optically driven processes is mainly caused by the local electromagnetic fields that surround excited nanoparticles. This discovery enabled me to develop of a broad spectrum of new analytical methods applied to problems in chemical and biological sensing to electrochemistry, materials science, ultrahigh vacuum surface science, and even to art conservation science. Recent work centers on the exploration of single molecule/single nanoparticle spectroscopy. One major goal is the development of ultrahigh vacuum, low temperature tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). TERS potentially combines the single molecule sensitivity of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with the atomic scale spatial resolution of the STM.As a physical/analytical chemist, I have studied the fundamental interactions of light with adsorbed molecules on metal surfaces that support surface plasmons.

VDavid Van Essen\u2019s laboratory has made major contributions to our understanding of cortical structure, function, connectivity, evolution, and development in humans and nonhuman primates. Their cortical cartography efforts began with manually generated cortical flat-maps and progressed to a powerful suite of software tools for brain visualization and analysis. Their efforts on cortical parcellation identified many visual areas in the macaque monkey and more recently characterized a novel 180-area-per-hemisphere parcellation of human neocortex using multimodal neuroimaging data from the Human Connectome Project. This parcellation is applicable to individual subjects and should enable better characterization of cortical organization and function in health, disease, development, and aging. Their studies of cortical connectivity revealed principles of distributed hierarchical organization and emphasize the importance of quantitative analyses of connection strengths. Analyses across species and ages reveal that higher cognitive regions have expanded preferentially in the human lineage and also during postnatal maturation. Their efforts in neuroinformatics promote user-friendly sharing of data at many levels of analysis. Van Essen has hypothesized that tension along axons and dendrites accounts for many aspects of morphogenesis, including how and why the cortex gets its folds and how cortical folding abnormalities arise in brain disorders. His earlier research included studies of simpler systems, including synapse elimination at the neuromuscular junction.David Van Essen\u2019s laboratory has made major contributions to our understanding of cortical structure, function, connectivity, evolution, and development in humans and nonhuman primates.

His group uses molecular markers to chart the development of muscles in the fruitfly Drosophila. The laboratory dissected the specification of segment-identity through the action of Hox genes in the epidermis, the nervous system and in the muscles themselves, each in distinct steps of development. These and other studies have provided a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms of flight muscle development. Most recently, they have identified a stem-cell population that makes flight muscles. The laboratory has contributed to the understanding of how stem cell lineages contribute to the development of the olfactory circuits in the antennal lobe of the fly and also of the walking motor-circuit. The laboratory\u2019s work on muscles and the motor system have now allowed the study of how the ability for coordinated locomotion emerges during development.VijayRaghavan\u2019s laboratory studies the neuronal circuits in the brain and motor system the development of muscles.

VAnne Villeneuve\u2019s laboratory investigates the molecular and cellular events underlying the faithful inheritance of chromosomes during meiosis, the specialized cell division program by which diploid organisms generate haploid gametes. These events are crucial for reproduction, since failure to execute them correctly leads to aneuploidy, one of the leading causes of miscarriages and birth defects in humans. One major goal is to understand the mechanisms and regulation of genetic recombination, which is responsible both for reassortment of genetic traits and for promoting segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. An inter-related goal is to understand how meiosis-specific chromosome organization is established, maintained, and remodeled to bring about successful genome inheritance. Dr. Villeneuve approaches these issues using the nematode C. elegans, a simple organism that is especially amenable to combining sophisticated microscopic, genetic and genomic approaches in a single experimental system. Dr. Villeneuve\u2019s research interrogates the process of meiosis at multiple different scales: 1) at the level of the DNA repair complexes that assemble at the sites of meiotic recombination; 2) at the level of the meiosis-specific chromosome structures that promote, regulate and respond to meiotic recombination events and 3) at the level of DNA organization at the whole-chromosome scale.Anne Villeneuve\u2019s laboratory investigates the molecular and cellular events underlying the faithful inheritance of chromosomes during meiosis, the specialized cell division program by which diploid organisms generate haploid gametes.

VWe seek to understand the interactions between virus and host in molecular and immunologic terms, how these interactions are disrupted during disease and how the mechanisms involved may be targeted therapeutically. We focus on host pathways that are important for human disease susceptibility such as autophagy and interferon responses. Our primary interest is in chronic virus infection and the virome, but we also study acute virus infection, bacteria, helminths, apicomplexan pathogens and commensals as needed to define mechanisms of immunity. We use genetic, computational, sequencing, and structural approaches to test hypotheses. The nature of this type of research is highly collaborative as we frequently require the expertise of our colleagues to get to the bottom of a scientific question.We seek to understand the interactions between virus and host in molecular and immunologic terms, how these interactions are disrupted during disease and how the mechanisms involved may be targeted therapeutically.

The answer to this question is "no" in dimension at least 3. This was proved by Artin and Mumford who exhibited a stable birational invariant for smooth projective varieties. Voisin used the decomposition of the diagonal with integral coefficients as a stronger necessary condition for stable rationality. She proved by a simple but powerful degeneration argument that a very general quartic double solid has no cohomological decomposition of the diagonal while its Artin-Mumford is trivial.A classical problem called the stable Lüroth problem asks whether a unirational variety must be stably rational.

VLeslie Vosshall\u2019s molecular neurobiology laboratory aims to understand the genetic basis of behavior, with particular emphasis on how organisms perceive and respond to external sensory stimuli and how these responses are modulated by the internal physiological state of the animal. They investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a diverse array of stereotyped innate behaviors \u2013 including the host-seeking behavior of mosquitoes, feeding and courtship behaviors of Drosophila flies, and the genetics and psychophysics of human smell perception. The mosquito genetics research program in the laboratory aims to dissect the genes and circuits that drive female mosquitoes to seek out human hosts. They were the first to apply genome-engineering techniques to the mosquito. Animals that lack the olfactory co-receptor Orco lose the ability to discriminate human from non-human hosts, and no longer avoid the insect repellent DEET. The group generated mosquitoes genetically unable to detect the important chemosensory cue carbon dioxide. These animals show defects in detecting unrelated sensory cues, indicating the multiple sensory cues synergize to drive mosquito behavior. This work opens up the possibility to study a wide variety of sensory pathways in this insect, as well as probing the central brain circuits that govern attraction to humans. Understanding the rules by which these animals target human hosts will enable the discovery of tools to reduce their capacity to spread disease.Leslie Vosshall\u2019s molecular neurobiology laboratory aims to understand the genetic basis of behavior, with particular emphasis on how organisms perceive and respond to external sensory stimuli and how these responses are modulated by the internal physiological state of the animal.

VI am a sociologist and demographer who studies the meaning and measurement of racial and ethnic identities, and the mechanisms by which racial and ethnic inequality is produced and changes over time. I have studied the patterns and meanings associated with white ethnic identities in the US--characterizing them as optional and voluntary in later-generation whites. I found that black immigrants and their children have ethnic identities which co-exist with their racial identities but are frequently overlooked by native born black and white Americans. The patterns of identification of the second generation were related to socioeconomic mobility, with the children of less successful immigrants more likely to identify as American. In recent studies of the second generation in young adulthood I have found that the children of immigrants are experiencing social mobility vis a vis their immigrant parents, and rapid assimilation into mainstream American society, although their fates are still tied to continuing racial stratification. My current work includes a longitudinal study of the migration and psychological and economic adjustments of a cohort of young people who survived Hurricane Katrina.I am a sociologist and demographer who studies the meaning and measurement of racial and ethnic identities, and the mechanisms by which racial and ethnic inequality is produced and changes over time.

VAs a cell biologist, I have been interested in elucidating the molecular and cellular bases of the extracellular microenvironment of cells and tissues and their roles in the normal functioning and pathogenesis. My approach was to use normal development and tissue repair paradigms to give insights into processes such as tumorigenesis. Starting with my discovery that fibroblasts were a source of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), we learned that MMPs required activation by a proteinase cascade, a fundamental process in vivo. We then linked the cytoskeleton to ECM through integrins and discovered that integrins signal. A recurring research theme has been the biology and function of inflammatory cells. The two themes came together when we discovered that macrophages were important sources of MMPs that functioned in vivo for healing wounds and angiogenesis. Concentrating on the role of MMPs in development and cancer, we discovered that recruitment of inflammatory cells was the key event in the angiogenic switch, which precedes progression to invasive tumors.  This compelling evidence that innate inflammatory cells contribute to tumorigenesis fostered a paradigm shift to highlight the central importance of the cellular microenvironment in normal development and in the progression of tumors, which we are still studyingAs a cell biologist, I have been interested in elucidating the molecular and cellular bases of the extracellular microenvironment of cells and tissues and their roles in the normal functioning and pathogenesis.

His research focuses on the identification and characterization of recombination repair proteins, and how they promote genome stability. He is known for his elucidation of the mechanisms by which recombination intermediates are processed to allow the separation of sister chromatids at mitosis. In particular, he identified nucleases that resolve four-way DNA junctions (Holliday junctions) and showed that these enzymes are essential for chromosome segregation. These nucleases were found to be tightly regulated in S-phase cells, and become active later in the cell cycle where they ensure the resolution of sister chromatid bridges. His work has important implications for the relationships between genome instability and cancer.Stephen West\u2019s laboratory is interested in the mechanisms of DNA double strand break repair by homologous recombination.

Western\u2019s main line of research in this area examines the emergence of very high rates of incarceration and its consequences for the disadvantaged communities in which incarceration is overwhelmingly concentrated. Western\u2019s research has documented extremely large racial and class disparities in imprisonment, and extraordinarily high rates of incarceration among young, African American men with very low levels of schooling. Other work has studied the effects of incarceration on economic opportunities and patterns of marriage and family life.

His research team demonstrated the first adaptive optics system for the eye, showing that vision can be improved beyond that provided by conventional spectacles. This work lead to wavefront-guided refractive surgery used throughout the world today. More recently, his group has been deploying adaptive optics to obtain microscopic images with unprecedented resolution in the living eye, which is providing a new way to study blinding diseases of the retina and accelerate the development of therapies for them.Williams' research marshals optical technology to address questions about the fundamental limits of human vision.

VMy colleagues and I aim to understand the neural computations that occur in sensory processing and sensorimotor integration, and to describe the biophysical mechanisms underlying these computations. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model, we combine in vivo electrophysiology with functional imaging, behavioral observations, genetic manipulations, and mathematical modeling. Our approach revolves around three key questions: (1) What neural computations occur at successive layers of a neural network? (2) What mechanisms implement these neural computations? (3) How do these particular neural computations (and their implementation) help us understand the behaviors that engage these networks, as well as the constraints that shaped these networks and behaviors?My colleagues and I aim to understand the neural computations that occur in sensory processing and sensorimotor integration, and to describe the biophysical mechanisms underlying these computations.

VI have primarily worked in infrared astronomy and observational cosmology. I started out studying the far infrared emissions from star forming regions, observing wavelengths blocked by the atmosphere using a telescope on a stratospheric balloon. I shifted to millimeter wavelengths to study the Cosmic Microwave Background using the COBE and WMAP satellites, then returned to infrared wavelengths with the Spitzer Space Telescope and the WISE (Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer) satellite. COBE, WMAP and WISE have all made all-sky surveys, while Spitzer is an observatory that can perform sensitive observations of known objects or survey small areas of the sky. WISE has discovered many thousands of asteroids in our Solar System, many hundreds of brown dwarf stars in the Solar neighborhood, as well as many hundred of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the distant Universe. My future plans include measuring the Universe with a deep near infrared survey of galaxies using the proposed Widefield InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and searching for asteroids in the thermal infrared using the proposed Near Earth Object Camera (NEOCam).I have primarily worked in infrared astronomy and observational cosmology.

VHao Wu\u2019s laboratory of structural immunology focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanism of signal transduction by immune receptors, especially innate immune receptors. The overall objective is to determine how macromolecular interactions mediate the transmission of signals from receptors to effectors to direct innate immune responses, using the core approaches of structural biology including crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. These structural studies have led to the discovery of large oligomeric intracellular signaling complexes or "signalosomes" such as helical assemblies and amyloid scaffolds. By promoting proximity-driven allosteric activation of caspases, kinases and ubiquitin ligases, these signalosomes induce cell death, cytokine maturation and expression of gene products for immune and inflammatory responses. Formation of signalosomes challenges the traditional view of signal transduction as a string of one-on-one recruitment and catalytic events, and provides a molecular foundation for understanding the microscopically visible signaling clusters in cells. Wu's discoveries establish the importance of oligomeric, cooperatively assembled complexes in signal amplification and threshold behavior for immune receptor signaling and by extension, for intracellular signaling more generally.Hao Wu\u2019s laboratory of structural immunology focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanism of signal transduction by immune receptors, especially innate immune receptors.

One of his current interests is in understanding in ever greater detail this first step in vision in cones, which human vision specifically depends on critically.Since the early 2000s, he has also been studying some newly discovered retinal photoreceptors, namely, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which mediate primarily non-image vision (versus the canonical, image vision mediated by the rods and cones). He found that these cells have an extremely low pigment (melanopsin) content -- only about 104 molecules per cell in mouse, compared to about 108 rhodopsin molecules in a mouse rod, despite the much larger volume of the light-sensitive part of the ipRGC. Nonetheless, the ipRGC can still detect and signal the absorption of a single photon. He now examines the cellular mechanism underlying phototransduction in these cells.Since the early 2000s, he has also been studying some newly discovered retinal photoreceptors, namely, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which mediate primarily non-image vision (versus the canonical, image vision mediated by the rods and cones).

He now examines the cellular mechanism underlying phototransduction in these cells.In addition, Yau is interested in olfactory transduction in the nose. He has found remarkable similarities but also interesting differences between olfactory transduction and rod/cone phototransduction, both being G-protein signaling pathways mediated by cyclic nucleotides (cAMP in olfaction and cGMP in vision). In contrast to the high-amplification signaling found in rod phototransduction, Yau has found a much lower amplification in olfactory-transduction signaling, which he nonetheless thinks is much more typical of G-protein signaling in general. He now studies the quantitative details in olfactory transduction.In addition, Yau is interested in olfactory transduction in the nose.

VYe's research group explores the frontiers of light-matter interactions. Ye and his group produce novel atomic and molecular materials in the quantum regime and precisely control these materials with laser fields. He has one of the world's most stable lasers with optical coherence time exceeding 10 s. This precision phase control is applied to a train of ultrashort pulses as well. Based on these control capabilities for both light and matter, Ye's group develops new technologies in high-precision laser spectroscopy, ultracold atoms and molecules, optical frequency metrology, quantum control, and ultrafast lasers. The group applies these new technologies to advance research in fundamental physics, precision measurement, and quantum physics. Current research projects include investigations of ultracold strontium atoms confined in optical lattices for use in highly precise and accurate atomic clocks and quantum information science, the precise control of optical frequency combs for sensitive molecular detections and high-resolution quantum control, as well as extreme nonlinear optics for exploring new frontiers in spectroscopy. The group also produces ultracold molecules for tests of fundamental physics, research aimed at controlling ultracold chemical reactions, and studies of strongly interacting quantum systems and their novel dynamics.Ye's research group explores the frontiers of light-matter interactions.
