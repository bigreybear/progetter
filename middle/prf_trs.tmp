VTim Softley is distinguished for his advances in two areas of Chemical Physics. First, the study of atoms and molecules in highly excited quantum states, known as \u2018Rydberg states\u2019. He has used his understanding of their properties, gained from laser spectroscopy and theory, to develop new applications including the study of model charge-transfer processes at solid-gas interfaces.  Second, he has pioneered unique experiments utilising combinations of novel physical devices for making cold atoms, molecules and ions, for studying the kinetics and dynamics of chemical processes at ultralow temperatures - close to the absolute zero of temperature - where quantum effects determine the reactivity.

VGreg Hannon is recognized for his contributions to small RNA biology, cancer biology, and mammalian genomics.  He has a long history in discovery of cancer genes, beginning with work that led to the identification of CDK inhibitors and their links to cancer.  More recently, his work has focused on small RNA biology, which led to an understanding of the biochemical mechanisms and biological functions of RNAi.  He has developed widely used tools and strategies for manipulation of gene expression in mammalian cells and animals and has generated genome-wide shRNA libraries that are available to the cancer community and was among the first to demonstrate roles for miRNAs in cancer.  His laboratory also discovered the piRNA pathway and linked this to transposon repression and the protection of germ cell genomes.  He has a continuous history of collaboration and technological innovation, including the development of selective re-sequencing strategies, broadly termed exome capture.

S'Ingrid Scheffer is an Australian clinician-scientist whose work as a paediatric neurologist and epileptologist has transformed understanding of epilepsy. She has defined many new epilepsy syndromes, and her work led directly to the identification of the first gene for epilepsy in 1995, and many epilepsy genes subsequently. In 2017, she led the first major revision of the classification of the epilepsies in 28 years, the major tool worldwide for the diagnosis and management of people with epilepsy. Her collaborative work has led to a deeper understanding of the biology of seizures and revolutionised scientific approaches to these disorders. Her clinical focus has shed light on the myriad of co-morbidities seen in people with epilepsy, particularly the severe infantile and childhood developmental and epileptic encephalopathies which often carry a poor prognosis.'

He is one of the founders of modern cryptography, and had made significant contributions to many of its branches. In 1977 he co-invented (together with Ron Rivest and Len Adleman) the RSA cryptosystem, which remains the best known and most commonly used public key encryption and signature scheme. Among his other inventions are secret sharing schemes, identity-based schemes, Zero-knowledge identification and signature schemes, ring signatures, and a variety of both classical and side-channel attacks on cryptosystems including differential cryptanalysis, cache attacks, bug attacks, and acoustic attacks. For these contributions he received the Pius XI Gold Medal in 1992, the Turing Award in 2002, the Israel Prize in 2008, and the Japan Prize in 2017. He is a member of the Israeli Academy, the US National Academy of Science, the Academia Europaea, the French Academy of Science, and the Royal Society.'

This last result came as a shock to a whole community of researchers, and has since shifted the focus away from old conjectures.'

He has a PhD in Botany from Cambridge University and has held academic and research leadership positions in several countries, including the Chair of Plant Ecology at Lund University and a founding Directorship of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry. He led the research programme Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System for NERC. He developed the standard model for pollen source area, popularized now widely used techniques to analyse species composition along environmental gradients, and led the international development of succcessive generations of large-scale ecosystem models \u2013 from equilibrium biogeography (BIOME) to coupled biogeochemistry and vegetation dynamics (LPJ). His current research applies eco-evolutionary optimality concepts to develop and test new quantitative theory for plant and ecosystem function and land-atmosphere exchanges of energy, water and carbon dioxide, with the goal of more robust and reliable numerical modelling of land processes in the Earth System.

S"At Yale since 1977, Bob Crabtree is now Whitehead Professor. In early work, he reversed homogeneous catalytic alkene hydrogenation to bring about alkane dehydrogenation. The so-called 'Crabtree catalyst' has proved useful for certain challenging cases and has therefore seen broad use. This was followed by work on complexation of molecular hydrogen to metals and finding a new type of hydrogen bonding that he called dihydrogen bonding. Recently, in collaboration with Gary Brudvig, he developed water oxidation and C-H bond conversion to C-OH with iridium catalysts in connection with the problem of green catalysis and alternative energy production. He has been American Chemical Society (ACS) and Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) organometallic chemistry awardee, Baylor Medallist, Dow, Williams and Mond lecturer, Centenary awardee, has chaired the ACS Inorganic Division and is the author of an organometallic textbook now in its 6th edition.

He pioneered the use of nucleotide analogs, synthesized at the beginning of his career, in muscle research and later for Ras-family GTPases, leading to the first ever structure determination of an unstable protein-substrate complex (Ras:GTP). Innovative use of semi-synthetic proteins led to an understanding of transport mechanisms of RabGTPases and to resolution of a longstanding controversy concerning targeting of these proteins to membranes. His group discovered and characterized hitherto unrecognized covalent modifications of Rab proteins by bacteria.'

His laboratory discovered that this pathway plays an important role in degrading many of the intracytoplasmic, aggregate-prone, proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases, like Huntington\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and various dementias. He pioneered the strategy of autophagy upregulation as a possible therapeutic approach in various neurodegenerative diseases and identified drugs and novel pathways that may be exploited for this objective. He has made key contributions to illuminating the relevance of autophagy defects as a disease mechanism and to the basic cell biology of this important catabolic process.

She read physics at Jesus College, Oxford, and for her doctorate shifted her focus to biology, studying in the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics. During her postdoctoral training she learnt protein crystallography and in 1989 reported the three-dimensional structure of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), a medically important cell signalling molecule involved in inflammation. In 1991 Yvonne started her research group at the University of Oxford as a Royal Society University Research Fellow. She investigates the molecular mechanisms by which cells signal to each other in the human body, an abiding interest first sparked by her studies on TNF. Yvonne\u2019s work, built upon strong links with clinically related groups, has provided fundamental insights into signalling systems of importance for cellular immunology, developmental biology and cancer.

Her laboratory demonstrated that elements could function as introns and that retrotransposons are the major cause of spontaneous insertion mutations in maize. In the genomics era her laboratory pioneered the computational analysis of transposable elements, culminating in the discovery of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs), the element most frequently associated with plant genes. As an HHMI Professor, Wessler adapted her research program for the classroom by developing the Dynamic Genome Program where incoming freshmen experience the excitement of scientific discovery.'

By combining imaging and molecular genetics she showed that different human chromosomes have preferred positions in the cell nucleus, and she has revealed that the packaging of individual genes in the nucleus changes during the differentiation of stem cells and in response to epigenetic mechanisms. Current research in Wendy Bickmore\u2019s laboratory focuses on how spatial genome organisation influences the regulation of genes in development and in disease.

S'Mark Gross is a pure mathematician specializing in mirror symmetry, which had its origins in string theory in the late 1980s. Mirror symmetry began with an observation that two very different geometric calculations gave the same result, leading to astonishing mathematical predictions entailing the equality of mathematically disparate objects. Since then, the quest to understand this mysterious correspondence has led to significant growth in a variety of different flavours of geometry. '

VDavid Lodge (BVSc 1963) worked in University of Bristol as a surgeon and anaesthetist, before doctoral studies with Tim Biscoe on the neuropharmacology of amino acids (PhD 1974). During postdoctoral studies at the Australian National University with David Curtis FRS, he helped establish the role of glutamate as a central neurotransmitter and characterised its actions between AMPA, NMDA and kainate receptor subtypes. At the Royal Veterinary College, David linked his interests in anaesthesia and glutamate receptors by making the key discovery that the dissociative anaesthetics, ketamine and phencyclidine, selectively blocked NMDA receptors. He related NMDA antagonism to psychotomimetic effects. This provided a basis for the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia and redirected pharmaceutical search for schizophrenia therapies. David was recruited as a director of Eli Lilly\u2019s neuroscience program, where he helped develop glutamate receptor approaches to brain diseases, resulting in clinical trials, e.g. for schizophrenia, some of which are ongoing.  David\u2019s current research concerns the mechanism of action of new \u2018legal highs\u2019 and the consequences of spontaneous mutations in glutamate receptors.

He began studying immunology in 1982 at M.I.T., where he identified the molecular basis of oncogene activation in Burkitts Lymphoma.  Thereafter, he first described the genes defining gamma-delta T cells, an evolutionarily conserved yet wholly unanticipated set of lymphocytes.  At Yale and then at King\u2019s College London and the Francis Crick Institute, Professor Hayday established that gamma-delta T cells are distinct from other T cells, commonly monitoring body-surface integrity rather than specific infections.  Their rapid responses to tissue dysregulation offer protection from carcinogenesis, underpinning Professor Hayday\u2019s and others\u2019 ongoing initiatives to employ the cells for immunotherapy.

VMark M. Davis, Ph.D. is well known for identifying the first T-cell receptor genes, which are responsible for T lymphocytes ability to \u201csee\u201d foreign entities, solving a major mystery in immunology at that time. He and his research group have made many subsequent discoveries about this type of molecule, subsequently, specifically concerning its biochemical properties and other characteristics, including the demonstration that T cells are able to detect and respond to even a single molecule of their ligand-fragments of antigens bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex cell surface molecules. He also developed a novel way of labeling specific T lymphocytes according to the molecules that they recognize, and this procedure is now an important method in many clinical and basic studies of T cell activity, from new vaccines against cancer to identifying \u201crogue\u201d T cells in autoimmunity. In recent years his has increasingly focused on understanding the human immune system, from developing broad \u2018systems\u201d approaches to inventing new methods to help unravel the complexities of T cell responses to cancer, autoimmunity and infectious diseases.

VJonathon Pines studies mitosis, the process by which cells divide. Jon serendipitously entered the mitosis field through cloning \u2018Cyclin\u2019 with Tim Hunt. Later, as a consequence of cloning human cyclins with Tony Hunter, Jon began to focus on the spatial organization of mitotic regulators. He pioneered the use of fluorescent protein tags to analyse the dynamic behavior and stability of these regulators in living cells.  His discoveries revealed that mitotic regulators are targeted to specific substructures at specific times, and that mitosis is exquisitely coordinated by the destruction of key regulators at different times in cell division. Jon\u2019s work has provided insights into how chromosome behavior in mitosis controls both the time and the rate at which essential mitotic regulators are destroyed, and these discoveries have wider implications for how cancers develop.

In another approach, by mimicking the behavior of plant tissues she discovered a new mechanism of shape transformations in soft materials and designed self-shaping stimulus-responsive polymers. Her other research interests include continuous microfluidic synthesis of polymer colloids with exquisite control over their compositions, dimensions, and shapes and the exploration of the behaviour of soft matter in constrained geometries."

This has allowed ancient DNA from extinct organisms, humans, animals and pathogens to be studied. He determined a high-quality Neandertal genome sequence, allowing for the reconstruction of the recent evolutionary history of our species and the realization that Neandertals contributed DNA to present-day humans who live outside Africa. By studying DNA sequences from a small Siberian bone he discovered Denisovans, a previously unknown hominin group distantly related to Neandertals. He also works on the comparative and functional genomics of humans and apes, particularly the evolution of genetic features such as the

VAlison Smith studies the metabolism in plants of starch and sucrose \u2013 the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis that fuel plant growth. Her research uncovered biochemical pathways responsible for the synthesis and degradation of starch granules in plants. She showed that these processes in leaves are subject to complex control by the circadian clock over the day-night cycle, ensuring the availability of carbohydrate to fuel metabolism during the night. Her focus is now on the mechanisms underlying this control, and the way in which carbohydrate availability is integrated with other sources of information to determine rates and patterns of growth and development in plants.

VGraham Bell is best known for his work on experimental evolution.  He has used laboratory populations of microbes to investigate fundamental questions about how organisms adapt through natural selection to novel environments. His experiments have answered questions such as: what are the conditions that favour specialists over generalists? and, is the course of evolution predictable or idiosyncratic?  His most recent experiments concern the process of evolutionary rescue.    If its conditions of life continually deteriorate a population will sooner or later become extinct, unless it is rescued by the spread of resistant types.  Bell has shown how rescue is affected by the size and diversity of the population, by immigration from neighbouring populations, and by previous exposure to similar stresses.

Early in her career, Dr Doudna\u2019s lab determined some of the first crystal structures of RNA and RNA-protein complexes, providing unprecedented insights into molecular function of non-protein-coding RNAs. More recently she and collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier determined the mechanism of RNA-guided bacterial adaptive immunity by the CRISPR-Cas9 system, enabling them to harness this system for efficient genome engineering in animals and plants. CRISPR-Cas9 is a transformative technology that is revolutionizing the fields of genetics, molecular biology and medicine. Dr Doudna is a recipient of numerous awards and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine and the National Academy of Inventors.

Kuriyan's work on protein tyrosine kinases has lead to explanations for how the cancer drug Gleevec achieves specificity, and how the catalytic activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor is activated. Much of our current understanding of how high speed DNA polymerases achieve very high processivity also emanates from Kuriyan's laboratory.

S"Michael Goddard is distinguished for his research into quantitative genetics and the genetic improvement of livestock, in particular by incorporation of molecular genetic data. He co-proposed and developed 'genomic selection' in which dense molecular markers are fitted to quantitative data by utilising linkage disequilibrium with QTL, thereby enabling more accurate selection decisions, including among animals without phenotypic records. Within a decade, it is being used world wide in animal improvement programmes and has potential in plant breeding and prediction of risk of genetic disease in humans. Goddard has made other major contributions to understanding the genetic basis of quantitative genetic variation, showing that common SNPs can collectively account for much of the heritability, and to inferences on population history."

She is known for her pioneering work on the isolation from normal mouse embryos of pluripotent stem cells, for which she coined the term \u2018embryonic stem cells\u2019. She is also widely recognized for her work on the function of Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) in the development of many organs including the limb and the role of negative feedback mechanisms for regulating FGF signaling in the mammalian embryo. These studies led to an appreciation of the exquisite sensitivity of developmental and cell biological processes to even small changes in the level of FGF signaling in vertebrate organogenesis.

VAllan Balmain was born in Wick, Scotland and studied Organic Chemistry at the University of Glasgow. He obtained Fellowships from the Royal Society and the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung to pursue research in Strasbourg and Heidelberg on the mechanism of action of \u201ctumour promoters\u201d. He then worked at the Beatson Institute, Glasgow, before moving to the United States in 1997. Balmain has pioneered the use of the mouse as a model system for understanding the complexity of cancer at the genetic, molecular and cellular levels. He established the first molecular link between chemical carcinogen exposure and initiation of tumour development, investigated the genetic basis of cancers induced by radiation, and used mouse genetics to identify genetic variants that cause cancer susceptibility. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1995, and Fellow of the Royal Society in 2015. In the US he was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and received the American Skin Association Achievement Award and the Herman Beerman Award from the Society for Investigative Dermatology.

In particular, his innovative work has introduced new classes of materials such as porous organic polymers with extended conjugation, and molecular organic crystals with high levels of porosity, which have changed the perception of what is possible in this field. In collaboration with computational chemists, he has developed strategies for the supramolecular synthesis of functional molecular crystals in a more designed way.'

VLinda Buck\u2019s research has transformed the field of odorant perception through the cloning of mammalian olfactory receptors. Together with Richard Axel, Buck developed an ingenious method to identify a G protein-coupled odorant receptor family of unprecedented size, comprising up to 1000 distinct genes members. Buck then used olfactory receptor genes as molecular tools to gain insight into the mechanisms and organisations strategies underlying odor perception. Her work showed that the olfactory epithelium is comprised of spatial zones that express different sets of receptor genes and that each zone is a mosaic of randomly interspersed neurons expressing different receptors. Buck then showed that individual olfactory neurons express a single receptor gene. In later work, Buck has documented the organization of olfactory axonal projections into the brain.

Mutations that change proteins are, surprisingly, often not especially deleterious. Laurence showed that this was because the genetic code is structured in a way that renders it highly error-proof. Similarly, in applying network representations of gene interactions, he revealed why many deletions of genes have little effect and which deletions tend not to be recessive.'

This has led to the conclusion that the deficiency of solar neutrinos detected on Earth was an issue of nuclear or particle physics, not of solar modelling; it also established that the very centre of the Sun rotates no more rapidly than the convective envelope, a matter of serious dynamical concern."

With several collaborators, he showed that this so far unexplained circadian clockwork probably ticks away in other species also, including humans.

VIn joint studies with his long-time collaborator, Phillip Hawkins, Leonard Stephens has made many outstanding contributions to knowledge of the variety and functions of inositol lipids and polyphosphates in eukaryotic cells. Early highlights were the mapping of new pathways of inositol phosphate synthesis, discovery of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 and pyrophosphorylated derivatives of InsP6, and structural proof that cells contain 3-phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) \u2014 the analytical methods they developed for these studies are now standard. They established that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is the main substrate of receptor-controlled type 1 phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), thus identifying PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as the key output signal from this reaction. They identified and isolated the GPCR-activated type 1B PI3K and, in a sustained body of work, defined its structure, explained its complex pattern of regulation, and proved its role in inflammatory events in vivo. They \u2014 in parallel with Dario Alessi \u2014 identified phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 as the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-activated link between PI3K-1 activation and protein kinase B activation, a key pathway through which PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 formation regulates cell proliferation and survival.

His early work improved an existing electron microscope and used it to image directly, for the first time, the atomic structure of defects in semiconductors. He next designed several instruments for electron energy loss spectrometry (EELS). These are now used by hundreds of researchers worldwide. He also co-authored an EELS atlas, which is a standard reference source for spectra. Recently, he designed and built a practical aberration corrector, thereby reaching a goal that had remained elusive for some fifty years. His novel microscopes are now able to map chemical elements in solid samples with atomic resolution and single atom sensitivity.'

Using the classical flax/flax rust interaction, he identified the molecular components from host and pathogen that determine whether disease occurs, and established that direct molecular recognition triggers defence responses. His work has enabled new approaches to controlling rust diseases that are currently responsible for enormous losses in many crop plants.'

Prior to his work, bacteria were believed to lack the organised cytoskeleton present in eukaryotes. He discovered that the bacterial proteins FtsZ and MreB resemble tubulin and actin respectively, both in having similar folds and by forming similar filamentous structures. In parallel, he analysed the structure and function of many other proteins involved in septum formation and nucleoid partition. His recent work followed outstanding early work on the structure of the 20S proteasome involved in degradation of misfolded proteins.'

S'Stephen Cohen has studied the mechanisms that organise spatial pattern and control growth during animal development. Although focused mainly on insect appendage development, his work has provided important insights into processes fundamental to animal development. Among these was the finding that compartment boundaries serve as patterning centres by producing gradients of secreted signalling proteins. These morphogenetic gradients instruct cells about their fate as a function of their position. He has also studied how morphogen gradients contribute to size control. Recent work has focused on microRNAs as regulators of tissue growth and metabolism with emphasis on their roles in disease.'

All living cells contain the equivalent of a rechargeable battery involving the chemicals ATP, ADP and AMP. AMPK senses when this battery is running flat by detecting increases in AMP and ADP relative to ATP. AMPK then acts to remedy the situation by switching on the breakdown of molecules such as glucose and fats to regenerate ATP, while switching off most ATP-consuming processes, including cell growth and division.'

VTom Foxon\u2019s research is on the physics and applications of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), a technique used to fabricate semiconductor heterostructures for device applications and fundamental studies. His early work at Philips investigated how the kinetics of surface atoms control growth of binary compounds and alloys, and how dopant atoms, which control the electrical conductivity, are incorporated in MBE. This pioneering work allowed Tom and colleagues to produce world-leading quality heterostructures, which were used by collaborators to discover quantised electrical conductance, new excitonic effects in superlattices, and phenomena related to the fractional quantised Hall effect. At Nottingham, he pioneered a method for growing large bandgap zinc-blende GaN. More recently, he has worked on ferromagnetic semiconductor heterostructures based on GaMnAs with Curie temperatures up to173 kelvin (a world record); the growth and properties of highly mismatched semiconductors, for example GaNAs; growth of graphene\u2013boron nitride by MBE and photocathodes (with Photek). He received the ISI Top Cited Scientist award (1999), the Al Cho MBE Award (2004) and the Welker Award (2013) for research achievements in semiconductors.

His innovative experiments on the thickness-dependence of glass transitions in thin films has stimulated a new research field. Recently, he has extended his studies to the denaturation of proteins at interfaces, demonstrating how the surface hydrophilicity has a strong effect, with implications for problems ranging from fouling to disease.'

VDavid Masser has made important contributions to transcendence and diophantine geometry. His early work on zero estimates on group varieties was a crucial step in the ultimately successful goal, finally achieved by Gisbert Wüstholz, of establishing the natural generalisation to algebraic groups of the theory of logarithmic forms. As a consequence of this development, there is now considerable and fruitful interplay between transcendence theory and many aspects of arithmetical algebraic geometry. As an example, David and Gisbert obtained in this way a new proof of a fundamental conjecture of Tate and thus made effective a central component of Gerd Faltings\u2019 famous work on the Mordell conjecture. In an entirely different context, David is also responsible, following an earlier insight of Joseph Oesterlé, for formulating the abc conjecture; this is a simple statement about integers which seems to hold the key to much of the future direction of number theory.

He made the definitive estimate of the density difference between solid inner and liquid outer cores, thereby proving a difference in chemical composition between the two, and worked out important consequences for the Earth\u2019s thermal evolution. He was first to establish the existence of large-scale, non-spherical structure in the Earth\u2019s mantle. He was first to observe anomalous splitting of free oscillations, later attributed to anisotropy of the inner core, and coupling between free oscillations caused by the Earth\u2019s rotation. Much later, he established a tight limit on the rotation speed of the inner core. He has pioneered many new techniques for analysing seismic data and used them to produce Earth models for all the seismic parameters.

S'Douglas Ross is renowned for his seminal contributions to the development and exploitation of gauge theories, both within and beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. His work has led to the understanding of the renormalisation structure of spontaneously broken theories and to the theoretical properties of the perturbation series in non-Abelian theories. He performed a number of the early perturbative calculations which helped establish quantum chromodynamics as the theory of the strong nuclear force. Among his contributions to physics beyond the Standard Model was the demonstration that the non-observation of proton decay excluded the simplest Grand Unified Theory.'

VPhilip Evans has creatively exploited techniques of protein crystallography and specific mutagenesis to analyse important biological systems. For phosphofructokinase, the key enzyme in the regulation of glycolysis, his structures of inhibited, activated and unliganded enzymes, coupled with extensive mutagenesis of functionally important residues, beautifully explained its catalytic mechanism and the allosteric control of its activity. His revealing analysis of the vitamin B12 dependent enzyme, methylmalonyl-coA mutase provided a structural explanation of the free-radical mechanism of covalent carbon\u2013carbon bond formation.

S'Luca Cardelli is distinguished for his innovative work on the theory and implementation of programming languages, extending to mathematical modelling of interactive and mobile systems. His early compiler for the ML language was crucial for its adoption by a wide community. As a leading designer of the language Modula-3, he advanced the understanding of modular structure for programming. He has made many contributions to type theory in computing, notably in subtyping, polymorphism and applications to inheritance. A series of papers with Martin Abadi, culminating in a book, constitute the deepest theoretical study there has so far been of object-oriented computing. His mobile ambients, involving a novel spatiotemporal modal logic, offer a model for modern mobile computation which provides an elegant conceptual basis for the rigorous analysis of systems up to the scale of the World Wide Web. His theoretical work is informed by his sharp appreciation of the architectural and security issues concerning migratory and distributed systems.'

VJulian Downward\u2019s work on the Ras GTPase has made seminal contributions to our understanding of how cellular signal transduction pathways are subverted in oncogenic transformation. His work provided the first demonstration that GTP-loading on Ras, which is commonly mutationally activated in human tumours, is normally regulated in response to extracellular factors; he went on to characterise growth factor receptor complexes mediating Ras nucleotide exchange, and to demonstrate that GTP-bound Ras binds to and activates the Raf kinase, which controls the MAP kinase pathway. Julian was first to demonstrate that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) is also a Ras effector, important in regulation of apoptosis. He showed that transformation by Ras requires interaction with multiple effectors, which contribute differentially to cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal regulation and apoptosis. His more recent work has established that both cell matrix and cell\u2013cell interaction activate the PI 3-kinase/PKB pathway, and thereby prevent programmed cell death, and that it is activation of this pathway by oncogenic Ras that allows anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells.

He has used the electron pulses to make the fastest \u2018real-time\u2019 measurements ever recorded and combined them with sub-0.1-angstrom spatial resolution.

He has revealed hitherto unsuspected structural and bonding patterns in metal\u2013ligand complexes, and the insight gained has led him to design and prepare innovative metal-based catalysts for the production of organic polymers by a variety of different polymerisation mechanisms. These have included catalysts for industrially important materials such as polyethylene and poly(methyl methacrylate), and for speciality materials such as bioresorbable and bioactive polymers. Amongst them are catalysts based on metals with no previous track record of polymerisation activity; he has moreover worked closely with industry to develop his systems for commercialisation.

His early work on energy transport processes in diffuse gaseous environments helped shape our understanding of the interstellar gas as a dynamic, multiphase medium. With Jeremiah Ostriker, he made a pioneering investigation of feedback processes during galaxy formation, and with James Binney he constructed one of the earliest theoretical models of cooling flows in rich clusters of galaxies. Observationally, Lennox pioneered the use of the newly available infrared arrays for deep survey work. He developed novel instrumental techniques enabling him to push ground based telescopes to new limits. With the Keck telescope, he has made significant contributions to our understanding of the high redshift intergalactic medium and was amongst the first to convincingly suggest that the peak of galaxy formation occurred quite recently.'

Studies of high-speed solidification phenomena in silicon, using Q-switched laser-induced melts, revealed notable evidence of constitutional supercooling and a very large enhancement of substitutional dopant solubility. He observed conclusively that amorphous silicon melts by a first-order phase transition and obtained the solidification velocity required to amorphize it.

VJohn Pyle has made major contributions to our understanding of the chemistry of the stratosphere and the troposphere, both by numerical modelling of the atmosphere and by interpretation of atmospheric measurements. In the 1970s, he developed the first interactive two-dimensional model of stratospheric chemistry and transport. This enabled him to be the first person to demonstrate that ozone depletion by CFCs varies with latitude. He pioneered the analysis of satellite data for dynamical and chemical studies, for instance by testing chemical steady state relationships there and elucidating the role of the semi-annual oscillation in controlling the abundance of trace species. Since the mid-1990s, he has been in the forefront of the development of three-dimensional models incorporating chemical and transport properties. His group is the largest in Europe and a world leader scientifically. This work has demonstrated unequivocally that chemical destruction of ozone in the Arctic spring has increased during the 1990s and has shed new light on the processes which destroy ozone in mid latitudes.

His work at the interface between structural biology and enzymology adopts a creative synergy that has allowed him to elucidate several important and novel mechanisms. This is exemplified by the first crystal structures of a DNA helicase that, surprisingly, showed the protein was active as a monomer, a view that challenged the established dogma that helicases must function as oligomers. Subsequent work elucidated the detailed mechanism of these enzymes and explained the strategies by which different helicases promote DNA unwinding.'

His work is distinguished by fruitful cross-fertilisation between theory and experiment, spanning a wide range. The Mott metal\u2013insulator transition and the correlated metallic state in its vicinity, the electron\u2013hole liquid in optically pumped semiconductors, properties of metals with charge and spin density wave order, and unconventional superconducting states in rare earth and transition metal compounds are some of the areas where his contributions have been pioneering. He has played a key role in determining the effective low-energy model for high-temperature superconductors and the identification of the symmetry of superconductive order in them. He has received the Hewlett-Packard Europhysics Prize for solid state physics and the John Bardeen Prize for superconductivity theory. He is an Honorary Member of the Royal Irish Academy and a Member of the US National Academy of Sciences.

His early work on the existence of cusp forms led to the disproof of a conjecture of Selberg. He has obtained the strongest known bounds towards the Ramanujan conjectures for sparse graphs, and he was one of the first to exploit connections between certain questions of theoretical physics and analytic number theory. There are fundamental contributions to arithmetical quantum chaos, a term which he introduced, and to the relationship between random matrix theory and the zeros of L-functions. His work on subconvexity for Rankin\u2013Selberg L-functions led to the resolution of Hilbert\u2019s eleventh problem.

Using budding yeast as a model system, he has combined biochemical purification, immunoelectron microscopy and genetic studies to analyse the organisation and function of this structure. He and others have defined the major components in a systematic manner, demonstrated the structural principles which underlie the complex layered features, and identified components which link the pole bodies to the spindle microtubules. His analysis has elucidated the way in which precise duplication of the spindle pole is achieved during each cell cycle. John also performed elegant studies on the structure and function of haemoglobin. Using chemical and enzymatic modification of specific residues, he was the first to identify amino acids responsible for the Bohr effect, the important physiological mechanism by which pH changes regulate the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen.'

Development of innovative methods to measure surface\u2013atmosphere exchange at the landscape scale, and application of process-based models to quantify fluxes at the country scale, have been important focuses. The work has been widely applied in the development of effects-based pollution control strategies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe.

He has made a series of exceptionally important contributions on many aspects of the phylum, and sea urchins in particular. He is also a pioneer in combining and reconciling molecular phylogenetics with palaeontological data. He was the first to show that relationships between stereom architecture and investing soft tissue in living echinoids could be extended to fossils, allowing many new insights into the structure and function of extinct forms. Outstanding monographs on fossil echinoderm faunas from many parts of the world have provided the basis for his cladistic analyses of echinoids and of echinoderms as a whole. These have been used to tackle general evolutionary problems such as periodicity in extinction and the mode of origin of higher taxa. The hallmarks of Andrew\u2019s work are integration of the biological and geological approaches and lucid insight.

VJohn Dainton has made leading contributions to our understanding of the fine structure of matter, through the high-energy scattering of leptons and photons off protons. His early work led to the experimental identification of partonic effects at large momentum transfer in photon\u2013proton interactions. Subsequently, his analysis of data in terms of photon structure revealed how the latter could be beautifully interpreted in terms of QCD, the gauge theory of the strong interaction. Since 1986, he has played a leading role in the experimental physics programme of the electron\u2013proton collider experiment, H1. As Physics Co-ordinator of H1 (1996\u201397), he was responsible for the publication of innovative measurements concerned with the structure of the proton, photon and their interactions at an unprecedented small scale. A seminal contribution was the development of a first understanding of hadronic interactions (the so-called \u2018Reggae parametrisation\u2019) in terms of a calculable gauge theory QCD. In 1997, he was appointed as Spokesman of the international collaboration H1, a position in which he leads the experiment and directs its scientific output.

VRoy Jackson conducts seminal research on the stability of a dispersion of particles supported by up-flowing gas. This work led to the prediction of voidage waves, subsequently observed in fluidised beds. He also pioneered theory describing the flow of particles round a gas bubble rising in a fluidised bed and gave the first proper analysis of densely packed particle flow down a vertical standpipe. His work on upward motion of a gas\u2013particle mixture in a pipe provides a rational explanation of particle accumulation near the walls.

VPaul Townsend made important contributions to the original formulation of supergravity, which is a generalisation of general relativity that unifies bosons and fermions. He subsequently originated many of the most significant ideas in the theory of the solitons of supergravity theories, known as supermembranes, and elucidated the significance of these objects in the underlying structure of string theory. Of particular importance was his development in 1994 of non-perturbative duality symmetries in string theory that led to a unified understanding of all superstring theories together with supergravity. This has transformed the study of string theory and led to its generalisation, known as \u2018M theory\u2019.

James and Scott Tremaine wrote the standard reference work on galactic dynamics.

VGary Gibbons has made important contributions to general relativity and the quantum theory of gravity. He played a leading role in the development of the Euclidean approach to quantum gravity and showed how it could be used to understand the thermal character of black holes and inflating universes. This revealed a deep and unexpected relationship between gravitation and thermodynamics. As part of the Euclidean quantum gravity programme, he discovered many of the known gravitational instantons and classified their properties. In the more conventional Lorentzian approach to gravity, he has studied the behaviour of solitons in gauge theories and general relativity and has shown how supersymmetry leads to Bogomolny inequalities on the masses and charges. More recently, he has been investigating the role of topology in gravity and has obtained important restrictions on how the topology of space\u2013time can change.

His early work made notable contributions to the synthesis and fundamental chemistry of natural porphyrins and polypyrrole macrocycles; some of this work has recently been developed by others for sensor systems. A major contribution has been to research the cascade processes involving amine\u2013imine\u2013azomethine ylide\u2013cycloadduct, and oxime\u2013nitrone\u2013cycloadduct. Chiral versions of imine-based 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions developed by Ronald are now widely exploited by industry, especially in the area of combinatorial chemistry, and his invention of a new reagent for the detection of latent fingerprints, based on early azomethine ylide studies, won a UK government SMART award in 1989. His original innovative contributions in the areas of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions and palladium-catalysed cascade processes have made him widely regarded as one of the leading organic chemists in the field.

The analyses by Joseph Silk and his group show how galaxy formation is related to the angular fluctuations in the temperature of the thermal cosmic background radiation, the intergalactic clouds of atomic hydrogen, and the plasma in rich clusters of galaxies. Stars are essential parts of galaxies; Joseph has been the leading advocate of the incorporation of empirical knowledge of star formation into cosmogony. These systematic studies by Joseph have played an important part in bringing us to our present tightly constrained picture of how galaxies formed.

S'Graham Warren has made major contributions to the understanding of membrane organisation in higher cells, particularly of the Golgi apparatus. By combining biochemistry and electron microscopy, he showed that proteins destined for the plasma membrane pass through each cisterna of this organelle, and demonstrated that it contains at least three distinct functional compartments which can be distinguished by their content of oligosaccharide modifying enzymes. He discovered that one of these enzymes, beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase, is retained in the correct part of the Golgi apparatus by its membrane-spanning domain and flanking regions, and has proposed a model to account for the way in which this is achieved. Graham has elucidated in detail the fate of the Golgi complex during mitosis. He found that transport to the plasma membrane is inhibited, while Golgi cisternae fragment and partition between daughter cells. He has also been at the forefront of efforts to develop cell-free assays to study these and related processes, most notably devising assays that reconstitute all of the early steps on the pathway of receptor-mediated endocytosis.'

VDenis Weaire has made significant contributions to solid state theory, materials science and computational physics. His early work on pseudopotential theory provided lasting insights into the factors which determine the structure of metals. He laid many of the foundations of the theory of amorphous tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors, beginning with a remarkable proof of the existence of a band gap for the Weaire\u2013Thorpe Hamiltonian. Other achievements include the first simulations of structure, coarsening and rheology of a realistic two-dimensional foam, and the incorporation of Plateau borders. The computation of a three-dimensional structure (the Weaire\u2013Phelan structure) which has cells of equal volume and a surface area less than that of Kelvin\u2019s 1887 tetrakaidecahedra was hailed as a significant discovery for minimal surface theory as well as foam experiments. Observations of new solitary wave phenomena in foam drainage and the formulation of a corresponding theory, lend further impetus to rapid progress in this field.

This may well be the start of autonomous intelligent brain-like machines. He has compared effects of brain damage with effects of losses in such a net, and found striking similarities with human impairment, such as for recognition of names and losses of categorisation. His work includes studies of mental imagery, and inventing puzzles for testing originality and creative intelligence.'

VKenneth Freeman\u2019s work is on the dynamics of galaxies and the dark matter which makes up most of their mass. As a student, he made the first detailed dynamical models of barred galaxies. He established the standard model of exponential disks of normal galaxies (Freeman disks), and discovered that the central surface brightness is similar for most spiral galaxies, so that they form an almost one-parameter sequence based on their scale length.

He was a leading figure in developing relationships between conformal field theories, string theory and string field theory. His profound insights into the duality symmetries of N=4 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills field theory led him to predict and confirm the existence of Dyon-monopole bound states that sparked an explosion of activity in related areas of physics and mathematics. He has been a leading figure in these developments, particularly in the application of string theory methods to determining quantum properties of black holes as well as the structure of Yang\u2013Mills quantum field theory.

S'James Staunton has made outstanding contributions to our knowledge of the biosynthesis of natural products. His early work with Alan Battersby on the alkaloids led to independent research from 1970 on polyketides, a family including many important antibiotics. Details of the biosynthesis of citrinin, sclerin, canescin and terrein were elucidated mainly using stable isotopes, and James devised novel techniques, for example the NMR beta-shift method for deuterium detection. He demonstrated by biomimetic syntheses how the cyclisation of polyketones to aromatic polyketides is controlled; his conclusions have been shown to hold good for natural products ranging from naphthalenes to tetracyclines. James recognised early the importance of combining chemical and biological approaches for research on aliphatic polyketides leading to the black box of polyketide biosynthesis being opened. James pioneered the use of electrospray mass spectrometry for the detection of intermediates bound to enzymes involved polyketide biosynthesis. His research on polyketide synthases (PKS) has transformed knowledge of these enzymes. James is widely regarded as a leader in his field.'

VRobert Thomas is renowned for his application of neutron and X-ray scattering methods to problems in physical chemistry, and in particular, the development of the grazing incidence reflection technique and its application to the study of wet interfaces. Wet interfaces are the surfaces separating air\u2013liquid, liquid\u2013liquid, and solid\u2013liquid phases and, although they are of considerable fundamental and technological importance, were poorly understood because of an almost total lack of experimental techniques for investigating them at the molecular level. In 1981, Robert was the first to propose that neutron reflection be applied to the study of adsorption, and he has subsequently developed the experimental technique and its analysis to a point where it gives uniquely detailed information about molecular structure at wet interfaces. He was the first to apply it to the air\u2013liquid and solid\u2013liquid interfaces and he has been able to reveal the structure of a variety of amphiphilic molecules and polymers at these two interfaces.

VAlan Plumb has performed pioneering work on atmospheric fluid dynamics, connecting fluid-dynamical insight and cutting-edge numerical simulation techniques with new observational information from high-resolution, multi-species chemical measurements. He has brought to bear original thinking about Lagrangian atmospheric transport leading to new insight into the interplay between chemical and dynamical effects, showing the way to a new generation of simplified global \u2018ozone assessment models\u2019 having far greater realism than current such models while demanding less computer power. This is of the highest importance in assessing the likely response of the ozone layer to, for example, future subsonic and supersonic passenger aviation. Throughout his career, Alan has consistently and repeatedly put his finger on key points about causal linkages in the atmosphere and made these points clear through outstandingly lucid papers and conference presentations, whilst upholding the highest standards of integrity and generosity to colleagues. One famous, influential and characteristic example is the work that led to the 1978 Plumb\u2013McEwan experiment \u2014 the laboratory analogue of the quasi-biennial oscillation of the zonal winds in the equatorial stratosphere.

A model, based on elastic strain energy, has enabled quantification of trace element partitioning between crystals and silicate melts. This enables dramatically improved modelling of igneous processes.'

VPeter Kronheimer has made outstanding contributions to a number of areas, ranging from complex geometry to manifold topology. Much of his early work centred on \u2018hyperkahler\u2019 structures in differential geometry, which are special solutions of the Einstein field equations. Extending the work of Nigel Hitchin, Peter constructed and classified all asymptotically locally Euclidean hyperkähler manifolds, uncovering a beautiful and intricate theory which combines group theory, algebraic and differential geometry. Soon after, he discovered a family of hyperkähler structures on complex coadjoint orbits. Since 1990, Peter\u2019s work has been focused on 4-manifold topology. In a long collaboration with Tomasz Mrowka, he developed the theory of singular solutions of the Yang\u2013Mills equations and applied it to obtain far-reaching results on 4-manifold invariants, and particularly to solve long-standing problems about surfaces in 4-manifolds. This work paved the way for the introduction of the Seiberg\u2013Witten invariants, a development to which Peter has made fundamental contributions.

His major contribution has been to research the synthesis and chemistry of novel metallated (lithium, copper and nickel) enol ethers, and to develop the uses of these intermediates in the synthesis of oxacyclic and geometrically defined alkene units in natural products of biological significance. Philip has synthesised the insecticide milbemycin beta 3, the potassium channel blocker talaromycin B, the hypotensive agent lacrimin, and the antihypertensive agent zoapatanol. His work is characterised by careful planning, attention to experimental details, and incisive finishing of meaningful synthetic targets. In particular, his total synthesis of the insect toxin pederin, and his synthetic work toward the immunosuppressant FK 506, have made him widely regarded as one of the leading organic chemists in the field.'

VDouglas Gough\u2019s notable theoretical work on helioseismology has given the first accurate determination of the depth of the solar convection zone and the first determination of the internal rotation of the Sun. He has played a major role in designing suitable measurements of solar oscillations from spacecraft. In astrophysical fluid dynamics, he has made inventive calculations of convective instabilities. He made the first calculation of the interaction of stellar pulsation with convection and showed how convection might limit the red extension of the instability strip in the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell (HR) diagram. He demonstrated that one possible explanation of the solar neutrino problem involves a turnover of the core predicted from an instability of the standard solar model.

S'Throughout his scientific career, Giacinto Scoles has been at the forefront of the inventions and applications of microscopic quantitative methods in the studies of the properties of matter. Giacinto constructed beam scattering machines and conducted highly accurate studies on interatomic and intermolecular interactions. In 1997, Giacinto introduced a new very powerful spectroscopic technique of thermal detection methods. It is an ingenious combination of molecular beam and lasers and is now used in many laboratories in the world. Giacinto used this method initially to study the fundamental physical effects, but gradually moved on to chemistry. He now uses this method very effectively for the studies of van der Waals molecules and clusters. In particular, the method of gas phase matrix spectroscopy initiated by him is perhaps the cleanest spectroscopic method for the study of large clusters. In the 1980s, Giacinto expanded his front further to the studies of surfaces and again kept producing the most unique and clear information on surface scattering.'

VGeorge Pickett is particularly renowned for his pioneering development of the nuclear refrigeration technique and its application to the investigation of superfluid helium-3 in the ballistic excitation regime below 200 microkelvins. Early heat capacity measurements at Oxford were followed at Helsinki by investigations of rare earth hyperfine heat capacities as well as precision measurements of the lambda point and phase separation anomalies in liquid helium isotopic mixtures. At Lancaster, George and Tony Guénault developed a novel form of nuclear refrigeration, using finely divided copper immersed in liquid helium-3 to overcome thermal boundary resistances. This led, in due course, to the lowest temperatures yet achieved in pure helium-3, in isotopic solutions, and in metals. The vibrating wire viscometer was ingeniously exploited to discover new nonlinear effects in superfluid helium-3 associated with the ballistic propagation of excitations, and satisfying explanations of the phenomena were devised.

VAlan Windle\u2019s central contribution to polymer science has been in the study of the degrees of structural order intermediate between fully crystalline and amorphous (liquid-like). The hallmark of his work has been innovative diffraction analysis closely coupled with the development of computer methods of molecular modelling. This approach confirmed the replacement of the meander model of the glassy state by the random coil theory, and also provided the first conformational models of a series of glassy polymers. He developed new ways of measuring and understanding molecular orientation in deformed polymers, and his studies of polymer\u2013solvent systems led to a theory of \u2018case II\u2019 diffusion, which is now widely accepted and exploited. His research on liquid crystalline polymers has been rewarded by a detailed understanding of the development of microstructure, and in particular by new insights into the crystallisation of random copolymers which depend on the matching of aperiodic sequences.

When carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds in organic compounds replace much stronger carbon\u2013fluorine bonds, either singly or multiply, a vast range of \u2018manmade\u2019 molecules becomes available. An illustration of this is the contrast between polypropene and inert Teflon, which is composed of all carbon\u2013fluorine bonds. Indeed, fluorine-containing compounds have wide-ranging applications in industry, including unique surface effects and important pharmaceuticals such as anaesthetics.

He also undertook definitive analyses of the genetics of sex ratio, particularly of temperature-sensitive sex ratios and driving sex chromosomes. Recently Michael has turned to studies of molecular evolution and shown how biased codon usage can be explained by small differences in translational efficiency.

S'Richard Wood is influential for his work on DNA repair and mutagenesis, which creatively combines genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry. In early studies, he explored the cell cycle-related response to radiation of DNA repair-deficient mammalian cells, and constructed a comprehensive picture of the DNA sequence changes caused by ultraviolet light. His most important breakthrough was to find a way to achieve nucleotide excision repair of DNA with human proteins in a cell-free system. This led to isolation of the XPA protein (defective in individuals with the cancer-prone inherited syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum) and the discovery that XPA preferentially binds to DNA damage. Dissection of the cell-free system also revealed that the DNA single-stranded binding protein RPA was required for the incision of damaged DNA, and the DNA polymerase accessory factor PCNA for DNA repair synthesis. The entire nucleotide excision repair reaction was reconstituted with purified proteins, setting a landmark in the field and paving the way for further fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanism of DNA repair.'

Wilson, in his work on streak cameras, first demonstrated the technique of subpicosecond chronoscopy. By synchronous repetition, the streak cameras function as oscilloscopes. This was followed by his pioneering work on coupled cavity or additive-pulse mode locking and, more recently, his discovery of the technique of self-mode locking. First observed in nonlinear effects in titanium-doped sapphire, this technique has proved generally applicable and enabled the commercialisation of subpicosecond pulses of wide tuning range. Finally, he has exploited the advantages of diode-pumped solid-state lasers in the field of nonlinear optics for frequency conversion by demonstration of the world\u2019s first all-solid-state optical parametric oscillator. These contributions are adding significantly to the power of laser techniques in physical investigation.

VPatrick Dowling has made outstanding contributions in the field of structural engineering, with emphasis on the design of steel-plated structures such as those used in bridge girder and ship hull design, and on the inelastic stability and damage resistance of major structural steel components such as the legs and pontoons of offshore platforms. His research has also led to new insights into the strength of composite steel\u2013concrete building, bridge and offshore construction. These distinguished theoretical and experimental achievements on the fundamental engineering science of structural behaviour have been complemented by his work as a major contributor to their effective incorporation in 1992 into the new Eurocode on the Design of Steel Structures, the complete development of which he steered over a period of ten years as Chairman of the relevant joint EEC/EFTA Committee.

VAndrew Fabian has made a remarkable variety of discoveries in X-ray astronomy. He has been especially influential because of his energetic success in making complementary observations with ground-based telescopes, and because his broad programmes are all motivated by deep theoretical understanding. His early advocacy of \u2018cooling flows\u2019 in clusters of galaxies \u2014 and their importance for galaxy formation, cluster evolution and dark matter \u2014 has been vindicated by the remarkable results from the ROSAT and ASCA satellites. He has investigated the spectra and variability of galactic nuclei and has, ever since his pioneering experiments using sounding rockets, been an authority on the cosmic X-ray background. With his research group, he has been responsible for much of the most thorough modelling of all classes of X-ray sources. As a theorist, he has also contributed original (and often durable) ideas on compact objects, binary stars, jets and cosmology. He has been an international leader in X-ray astronomy, involved in major worldwide collaborations, and prominently engaged in almost all current and future missions.

VAndrew Lyne conducts research on radio astronomy. In 1979, he achieved the first radio measurements of the trigonometric parallax of a pulsar, giving the first basic advance in measurements of distance outside the solar system since Friedrich Bessel\u2019s optical measurements in 1838. Using refined search methods, he discovered more than half of the 700 known pulsars, including two-thirds of the 50 known millisecond pulsars. This work led to definitive studies of pulsar populations and life histories. His measurements of proper motion have confirmed his earlier discovery, using interstellar scintillation, of the high velocities and short lifetimes of most pulsars. Andrew also developed new techniques which have made possible the search for pulsars of very short periods. His discovery of pulsars with periods of milliseconds in two globular clusters has given new insight into the origin and evolution of pulsars. His measurements of Faraday rotation in the radiation from over 190 pulsars have produced unique data on the galactic magnetic field. Andrew is recognised as one of the foremost international authorities on pulsar phenomena.

The maps he has obtained for the field at the core\u2013mantle boundary more than 100 years ago are as detailed as present day maps from satellite data, and have opened up a new field concerned with the fluid dynamics of the core. He has also made important contributions to dynamo theory and to seismology.

He has made many seminal contributions to the theory of soliton-like particles in two and three dimensions. Solitons are localised, twisted structures in a field that are topologically stable. He calculated the forces between static and moving monopoles and vortices in gauge theories, leading to the geometrical idea of \u2018moduli space\u2019 dynamics. This has been applied to the classical, quantum and statistical mechanics of solitons. He has also developed the theory of skyrmions as a soliton model of atomic nuclei.

S'Frank McCormick has contributed to our understanding of intracellular signalling pathways related to cell growth and carcinogenesis. In particular, he discovered GAP, a protein regulator of the Ras small GTP-binding protein, which activates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras and switches off Ras-induced signals, which can lead to growth or differentiation. The Ras pathway is highly conserved and Ras GAP activities have subsequently been found in all eukaryotes. He has also shown that there are distinct GAP activities for other Ras-related small G proteins. Mutation of a GAP-related protein, NF1, which he showed has Ras GAP activity, is involved in neurofibromatosis type I. He has performed many elegant studies on the regulation of Ras activity and its downstream targets, and is regarded as a world leader in the field of signal transduction.'

He is best known for his theorem of 1965 (with C. S. Seshadri) proving that holomorphic bundles on an algebraic curve come from unitary representations of its fundamental group. This opened up a whole avenue of progress which is still proving remarkably fruitful. Mudumbai has continued to be a leader in the study of moduli spaces of holomorphic bundles, but apart from that his work with Sundararaman Ramanan on universal connections has proved influential, and he also (with Kiyosato Okamoto) proved the first case of Langland\u2019s conjecture about the realisation of the discrete series of representations of a Lie group.

VAfter a start in theoretical solid-state physics, Ekhard Salje has become one of the world leaders in applying the theoretical and experimental advances of physics to problems in mineralogy and solid-state-physics. His work on feldspars has shown how the internal state of order and strain in a mineral can be understood and related to its geological history via a few parameters in the Landau free energy. This approach has been successfully extended to kinetics and resulting textures. He was first to use the line shape of \u2018hard\u2019 phonons to measure degree of order, a technique particularly useful in complex mineral structures. He studied metal\u2013insulator transition in terms of the behaviour of polaron gas. The stability of minerals and functional materials was elucidated by resonance methods and the avalanche properties of collapsing porous materials was shown to reproduce the acoustic fingerprints of earthquakes and the stability of mine shafts. He demonstrated atomic mechanisms of acoustic emission during mechanical and electric perturbations. His work on multiferroic materials in physics and material sciences is internationally leading.

These latter ideas are currently being pursued vigorously around the world where they are resulting in lasers having greatly enhanced performance.

He has played a leading role in the development of the lattice formulation of QCD into a quantitative non-perturbative technique and in the use of this formulation to compute, from first principles, a number of physical quantities, including deep inelastic structure functions, electromagnetic form factors of hadrons and semi-leptonic decays of charmed mesons.'

VGurdev Khush applies genetics and cytogenetics to the increased production of irrigated rice in East and Southeast Asia. Through his breeding programmes, he developed the variety IR 36, which has occupied millions of hectares of land. Gurdev\u2019s work has been a major contributor to the increases in rice production per caput in Asia. Following investigations of relevant \u2018genotype x genotype\u2019 interactions, he incorporated from other parents resistances to virus, bacterial and fungal diseases and to several insect pests. Some resistances were transferred to cultivated rice from related wild or weedy species. In breeding research, Gurdev isolated the 12 trisomic lines of rice that enabled RFLP mapping to be assigned to chromosomes. He has used the comparative RFLP maps of rice and of related species to determine the genomic changes associated with the introgression of resistance. Gurdev is breeding new plant types to increase yield potential according to models that define the required morphological and physiological characteristics. Such increase is necessary if the human food requirements of Asia are to be met in the 21st century.

His book on the subject is a classic and is likely to remain so. He and his students have discovered important new phenomena, including the previously unsuspected existence of \u2018noise gratings\u2019. Their work has been of critical importance in the successful application of volume holograms. This research led naturally to the extension top photorefractive devices, where Laszlo has produced the most complete theory of four-wave mixing, which for the first time was able to account for key observations. His research has led to the observation and explanation of amplification effects, which are of fundamental interest and of potential utility.

VGeoffrey Pert has conducted pioneering work, both theoretical and experimental, in the design of UV laser systems. At a time when the main thrust was towards true X-ray systems, Geoffrey independently decided to design systems based on recombination in laser-produced plasmas, to work at wavelengths of 100 angstroms and to approach shorter wavelengths by scaling from there. His realisation of the crucial role of resonant line trapping was followed by its resolution by motional Doppler effects in an expanding plasma. This led first to the theoretical design and then the actual construction of the carbon fibre laser. Early results showing gain were received with scepticism but a final convincing demonstration of gain was made at the Central Laser Facility in 1985. Geoffrey proposed the coating of carbon fibres to move to shorter wavelengths, and gain was demonstrated for lithium-like ions of aluminium and chlorine. He is now involved in moving laser wavelengths into the \u2018water window\u2019 at which point important applications, for example X-ray microscopy of biological materials, become possible.

VRobin Marshall has been a consistent innovator in the field of high-energy electron\u2013positron annihilation, making many personal contributions. He was the first at the PETRA e+e\u2013 collider at DESY to determine the electroweak properties of leptons and then quarks. These papers become templates for other experimenters over the next ten years. He performed the definitive analysis of the world\u2019s electron\u2013positron data to produce what are now the \u2018text-book\u2019 results for the QCD \u2018fine structure\u2019 constant and the fermion electroweak parameters. In 1984, he published a novel method for isolating bottom (b) quark events and then used the method to measure the b electroweak properties, showing that it belonged to a weak isospin doublet, and hence that the top (t) quark exists. This was one of the most significant physics results from PETRA. He has been a group leader at RAL since the 1980s, and in the 1990s prepared an experiment at the electron\u2013proton collider, HERA, at DESY.

He was one of the first to appreciate the special advantages of pulsed neutron sources for studies of condensed matter, pioneering new approaches (like the high-symmetry spectrometer) and methods of analysis (for example, profile refinement of pulsed neutron data) which are now used worldwide. He has pioneered industrial applications, such as diffraction methods for residual stress in engineered structures and small angle scattering for microstructure evolution in cements. For such work, he was awarded the 1986 Duddell Medal. Colin also spearheaded the exceptionally successful pattern recognition components of Europe\u2019s first collaboration for industrial applications of neural nets (ANNIE). His central innovative role led to commercial applications, notably automatic weld defect classification and gas chromatography analysis. His was also the first to use neural nets for multivariate financial index analysis, an approach now widely adopted by banks and commercial institutions.

He developed (jointly with Edward Gaposchkin) the first comprehensive model of the Earth\u2019s gravity field using combined satellite and geodetic data and demonstrated the close link between the terrestrial gravity field and plate tectonic processes. This work has had a major influence on several key areas of geodynamics. He has also carried out a comprehensive investigation of the rotation of the Earth, including tidal interactions between the Earth and Moon and extending to tidal effects upon the orbits of artificial satellites. This work clarified some of the key geophysical factors which control these basic processes and has established both the standards and the methodology for all subsequent work in this field. More recently, he has made some important contributions to understanding the formation of intracratonic basins via compressional mechanisms. These are particularly relevant to the formation of the Amadeus Basin in Central Australia.

Erwin co-discovered the existence of single ion channels and co-developed a technique that enables scientists to measure the miniscule electrical currents that pass through each ion channel. By allowing the passage of ions through the membranes of cells in our body, ion channels thereby mediate important signals such as nerve impulses and hormonal signals.'

VBrian Ridley has conducted important work on negative differential resistance (NDR), instabilities and hot-electron transport in semiconductors. He jointly discovered the electron transfer mechanism (Ridley\u2013Watkins\u2013Hilsum effect) which underlies microwave generation in Gunn diodes, and he was the first to discover the impurity barrier mechanism for NDR, and to demonstrate its existence in germanium. He was also the first to describe the consequences of NDR instabilities in terms of propagating dipole domains and current filaments, and the existence of these nonlinear entities has been amply verified in a wide variety of solids. His work on acoustoelectric instabilities led to his invention of the microsonic analogue of the laser. Throughout his research he has made original contributions to the theory of electron transitions in solids, particularly impurity scattering and multiphonon processes, and this work is embodied in his monograph Quantum Processes in Semiconductors, widely used as a reference text. His interest in popularising physics is manifested in his book, Time, Space and Things, which has been much translated and widely quoted.

VScott Tremaine conducts important work on planetary rings and discs, and in theoretical astrophysics. The kinetic theory of rings and particles in both dilute and dense limits is due to him and his collaborators and he has studied numerically the intermediate case. With Peter Goldreich, he predicted density waves in Saturn\u2019s rings and shepherd satellites of thin rings since observed by spacecraft in the ring systems of Saturn and Uranus. He demonstrated that tides, not panning stars, are the primary creators of \u2018new\u2019 comets and in consequence modified our concept of the extent of Oort\u2019s proto-cometary cloud. With James Binney, he has written an outstanding book on galactic dynamics, a field to which he has made vital contributions. His considerations of phase space put severe constraints on the idea that neutrinos with rest mass are a major constituent of the Universe. He has derived new tests of the equivalence principle for both neutrinos and photons. Scott was founding Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics to which he drew a most able staff.

He has determined the seismic velocity structure across volcanic margins in the North Atlantic, finding evidence of crustal igneous intrusion and extrusion. He developed new methods of imaging beneath offshore basalt flows to see the structure beneath them. He proposed that volcanic margins develop where upper mantle temperatures are raised over a convective plume (a hotspot) and has thereby been able to explain the distribution of volcanic margins and of flood basalts worldwide.

VRichard Borcherds has conducted seminal work in applying the ideas of conformal quantum field theory to solve classical problems in pure mathematics. At the same time, his work has led to a deeper understanding of conformal field theory. After important work on the classification of lattices, Richard introduced the notions of a vertex algebra, which played a key role in the construction of the natural representation of the monster group (the largest sporadic finite simple group) and a generalized Kac\u2013Moody algebra, which led him to a proof of the moonshine conjectures of John Conway and Simon Norton. The character formula he proved for such algebras, together with the observation that their denominator functions are often automorphic forms on 0(n,2) led him to a remarkable product formula for the modular function j, amongst other results. Recently, his introduction of quantum rings, generalising vertex algebras, has provided a natural setting for the elusive concept of fusion in conformal field theory.

VKevin Kendall developed the theory of cracks so as to apply it to a very wide range of problems of great industrial significance. Through a series of experiments, Kevin has shown that the thermodynamic theory of cracking can be used to explain and predict such varied phenomena as adhesion, some types of friction, colloidal behaviour and the internal structure of complex solids. Solutions have been obtained for the adhesion of elastic spheres, failure of lap joints, interfacial dislocations, delamination of a composite, failure in compression, crack arrest at an interface, rolling friction of cylinders, crushing of particles and the strength of porous solids, as well as the behaviour of powder compacts. He has also used theory synthetically to design polymer latex coatings and to devise new processes for making strong cements besides suggesting the optimum interfacial adhesion in composites. His work has also greatly illuminated a number of older problems such as Galileo\u2019s argument on flaw statistics and Newton\u2019s supposition on the attraction between spheres.

Several important related reactions involving allylsilanes, allenylsilanes, propargylsilanes, silyl enol ethers and dienol silyl ethers showed the power a silyl group has to control the outcome of carbocationic reactions. He has also developed the phenyldimethylsilyl cuprate reagent, which allows the flexible introduction of silyl groups into many types of molecule. Coupled with this is the development of the silyl-to-hydroxy conversion that allows phenyldimethylsilyl groups to be changed into hydroxyl groups with retention of configuration. Using these reactions, he has added effective methods for the stereocontrol of reactions using silicon to the regiocontrol developed earlier. In addition, his popular books on molecular orbitals and on spectroscopy have had a major influence by carrying these topics to a broad audience of organic chemists throughout the world.'

VThrough his seminal contributions to geophysical fluid dynamics, Christopher Garrett has clarified and illuminated a range of processes basic to our understanding of the ocean and to the interpretation of observations. After early work on wave trains in inhomogeneous media, he collaborated with Walter Munk to systematise knowledge of the spectrum of internal waves, leading to his important work on fine structure, mixing and dispersion in the ocean. The breadth of his interests is wide, ranging from the generation of Langmuir circulations by surface waves to iceberg trajectories and ocean tides. He has received the President\u2019s Prize of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (1979) and the Huntsman Award (1982).

VMichael Hall has conducted important work in applied and computational mathematics with especial reference to aeronautical engineering. He has made significant research contributions in the study of unsteady and three-dimensional boundary layers, in vortex dynamics including vortex breakdown, and in the computation of nonlinear inviscid transonic flows. His most recent work is on Navier\u2013Stokes solvers, including turbulent models. Since the 1970s, the field of computational fluid dynamics has been developed very strongly, including important advances in the computation of inviscid transonic flows. Michael has been in the forefront of this activity and his multigrid Euler equation solver is thought to be one of the very best available, if not the best. As one of the leaders in computational fluid dynamics, Michael shows also a keen appreciation of the practical consequences for aeronautical design of results obtained by numerical computation. In 1991 Michael founded his consultancy Hall C.F.D. Limited which he carried through until 2003.

VDavid Rhodes is best known for his analysis and design of microwave components and filters. David\u2019s major contributions to this branch of electronics has not been confined to academic aspects of the topic. It encompasses new theory for filters and multiplexers, the practical implementation of their design in waveguide and microstrip form and the engineering development of such components \u2014 including new techniques for their industrial manufacture. He has made major contributions to circuit analysis and synthesis and was the first to synthesise the effective and hence very efficient class of microwave elliptic filters. The contributions also include the development of specialised software packages needed for computer-aided design of systems involving high mechanical tolerances required for operations at frequencies up to 100 gigahertz. Whilst still holding a chair at the University of Leeds, David formed his own company which now takes a leading role in the manufacture of multiplexers and filters to an international market. Such devices are now extensively used in communication satellites and military systems.

Other research of lasting significance has concerned fully turbulent wakes and boundary layers and the nature of bursts. In the field of rarefied gas dynamics, he has made major contributions to constitutive relations for free molecule flow and shockwave structure, and has recently put forward a novel theory for infinitely strong shocks.

In UMIST his calculation of costs and benefits of Thames tidal flood prevention (Nature 1970 pp1203/4) led to the building of the Thames Barrier. In UMIST he developed a pore-water pressure transducer that extended the scope of Soviet Maj. Gen. G. I Pokrovski's centrifuge testing to study effectively stress in models. Returning to Cambridge he modelled both the quasi-static liquefaction of a "Mississippi river crevasse", and the dynamic liquefaction in a water saturated embankment in a model-scale earthquake with data capture of dynamic pore pressures for US Army Engineers Waterways Experiment Station (WES). Finally his Cambridge Phenomenon company Andrew N. Schofield and Associates Limited built the WES Army Centrifuge facility.

From these results, he deduced the importance of the particular code created by the person during original experience, and of the access to that code provided by the conditions of recall or recognition. He also distinguished memory for individual events or \u2018episodes\u2019 from that for lasting \u2018semantic\u2019 relationships. His methods and distinctions are increasingly finding application, not only to theories of memory, but to the analysis of the effects of brain injury.

S'Nigel Weiss is renowned for his work in the theory of convection, for developing appropriate numerical techniques, and for pioneering their use in precise numerical experiments in order to gain a qualitative and comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of complicated nonlinear systems. Among many notable achievements in this field, he has been instrumental in the identification of a period-doubling route to chaos in a system of partial differential equations describing doubly-diffusive convection. He has made wide-ranging studies of the magnetoconvective processes occurring in the Sun and similar stars. In early work of lasting influence, he analysed the process of magnetic flux expulsion and the mechanism of concentration of the magnetic field into ropes from which fluid motion is excluded. More recently, he initiated a programme of research in the field of nonlinear compressible convection, an important step towards realistic modelling of stellar convection zones.'

S'Robert Ramage has made versatile and innovative contributions to a number of important areas of organic chemistry. His seminal ideas on sesquiterpene biosynthesis were followed by stereochemically controlled chiral syntheses of a range of complex terpenes. He participated with Robert B. Woodward in the classical synthesis of cephalosporin C, a feat which significantly influenced later synthetic approaches to the beta-lactam antibiotics. Together with Alan R. Battersby he solved the enigma of colchicine biosynthesis, established the structure of a new series of alkaloids and determined the biosynthetic pathway to these homoaporphines. In the ergot alkaloid field, he designed a new synthesis of lysergic acid. Initially with George W. Kenner, and then independently, he made extensive contributions to polypeptide chemistry particularly in the gastrin field with structural elucidations followed by total synthesis of minigastrin and porcine big gastrin. He innovated many useful methodologies for peptide synthesis and applied them successfully to high molecular weight polypeptides.'

VKenneth Bray has made seminal contributions to the study of gas flows accompanied by chemical reactions and relaxation effects. His early work dealt with flows of dissociating and ionising gases, with special reference to hypersonic flight in the atmosphere. This research was the first to identify the phenomenon of \u2018sudden freezing\u2019 of internal molecular energy modes and chemical reactions during the expansion and rapid cooling of hot gases in de Laval nozzles, with implications for the design of rocket motors and high-speed wind tunnels. The effect is also central to the operation of gas dynamic lasers. Work on the de-excitation of molecular vibrational states far from equilibrium followed. Some of his most important achievements lie in extensive studies of turbulent combustion in gases, using probability density function ideas, paying careful attention to the couplings that exist between fluid-mechanical behaviour and combustion-energy release, and exploiting both theory and experiment. This important work has achieved worldwide recognition.

He pioneered the development of long-term culture techniques for haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, devised methods permitting the selective formation of various lineages of blood cells and exploited these culture methods to prove that the early events in blood cell formation are controlled by specialised stromal cells in the marrow. He developed cloned immortalised haematopoietic cell lines with varying differentiation commitment and used these to analyse the mechanisms by which oncogenic viruses transform normal to leukaemic cells. The widespread application of his novel techniques has been crucial for recent rapid advances in cellular haematology.

His early work was concerned with the chemistry of nitrosyl complexes and the reactivity of the coordinated nitric oxide group. Subsequent work was concerned with the structure and reactivity of simple organic molecules coordinated to a metal centre, particularly those containing unsaturated carbon centres. The emphasis of his more recent work has been in the field of polynuclear carbonyl complexes, particularly in ruthenium and osmium. A wide range of new bonding modes for both metal and ligand groups have been identified and the general stereochemical properties of the metal polyhedron have been rationalised in terms of a model depending upon the packing of the coordinated carbonyl groups. This model has been extended to account for the fluxionality observed in these complexes. Brian has been responsible, in part, for the rapid development of cluster chemistry and the recognition of the difference in the properties of these complexes from mononuclear species.'

He made major contributions to the foundation of the perturbative treatment of quantum chromodynamics, successfully applying it to high-energy processes and developing connections with the low-energy quark model. He developed predictions of unified models of the fundamental forces for polarised lepton scattering, for Sin2\u03b8W, for proton decay, and for inflationary cosmology. He discovered that in supersymmetric models, the electroweak symmetry can be broken by quantum effects, and he pioneered the development of models based on this idea.

VAndrew Soward is well known for his work on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and especially dynamo theory, and also for his significant contributions to linear and nonlinear stability theory. By powerful use of asymptotic analysis, he has solved a number of very difficult problems in applied mathematics. By a new pseudo-Lagrangian technique for studying lightly damped fluid systems, he elucidated previously inexplicable features of Braginskii\u2019s geodynamo. Andrew has also provided explicit examples of steady fast dynamo action, so disproving a conjecture that such dynamos did not exist. Andrew identified new rotating modes of nonlinear convection in rotating systems, and in collaboration with Steven Childress, established a now celebrated MHD dynamo model in a rapidly rotating Benard layer; he also gave the first demonstration that situations exist where oscillatory MHD dynamos generate magnetic fields more readily than steady flows can. Assisted by Eric R. Priest, he provided the first mathematically satisfactory account of the Petschek mechanism of magnetic field line reconnection. Andrew also gave the first complete solution of the Stefan (freezing) problem in cylindrical geometry.

VKenneth Packer is well known for his pioneering development of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and its application to the solution of a wide range of chemical, physical and biological problems. Early in his career, he observed the first AB4X spin system and made the first magnetic resonance observation of niobium-93 in solution, thus demonstrating the potential of multinuclear NMR in chemical sciences. Hitherto, chemically related NMR had been restricted to the observation of protons, fluorine and phosphorus. His analysis of line shapes of spin-1/2 nuclei coupled to central quadrupolar nuclei enabled quantitative measurements of the spin\u2013lattice relaxations of the central nuclei in multinuclear molecules and ions to be made \u2014 a technique subsequently shown to have wide application. He applied the method to the elucidation of the structure and dynamics of solutions of electrolytes. Thus, he demonstrated the complex relationship between microscopic dynamics and bulk transport properties in these cases. He was the first in the United Kingdom to apply pulsed magnetic field-gradient spin echo techniques to the investigation of diffusion and flow in liquids.

S'Richard Walcott is well known for his work on lithospheric flexure and continental deformation. His early work on flexure of the oceanic and continental lithosphere, produced by volcanic sedimentary and ice loading, led to an understanding of the rheology of the lithosphere on geological timescales and started a new field of geophysics. Since returning to New Zealand, he has showed how to use geodetic observations to study continental deformation, and has applied these methods to New Zealand with great success. He has also made careful palaeomagnetic observations, and has demonstrated that the present rotation rate can account for the observed rotations. His study was the first to show the great importance of geodetic observations in studies of continental tectonics, and many groups are planning similar studies elsewhere. His great influence in New Zealand is one reason why research in the earth sciences there is so flourishing.'

S'Kenneth Walters has made a number of significant contributions to rheology and the development of rheological science in the United Kingdom, and has conducted extensive studies of the behaviour of non-Newtonian fluids, particularly elastic liquids. He has made important advances in two major areas: the measurement of rheological properties, and the numerical solution of complex flows. In the first area, he has extended the theory of viscometric flows, carried out a searching analysis of sources of error in the principal instruments in current use, and maintained a strong commitment to industrial applications arising in the manufacture of lubricants, detergents and paints. His book, Rheometry, is a standard work of reference. He is one of the main pioneers of the application of numerical methods to the rheology of liquids and the book Numerical Simulation of Non-Newtonian Flow, of which he is joint author, is an influential text in a rapidly evolving field of research.'

VThe most significant of John Cardy\u2019s contributions to theoretical physics concern the application of ideas of quantum field theory to statistical mechanics. In 1984, field theorists demonstrated that the property of conformal covariance imposes severe restrictions on behaviour of two-dimensional systems. John took this principle and turned it into a precise quantitative tool for examining two-dimensional criticality. As a by-product, he discovered a formula for black hole entropy in string theory. He single-handedly developed ideas of boundary conformal field theory, which has applications to quantum impurity problems as well as string theory. He discovered the Cardy formula for two-dimensional percolation, the study of which has led to two Fields Medals for other mathematicians. More recently, he developed ideas of quantum entanglement and non-equilibrium dynamics in many-body systems. He is a recipient of the Boltzmann Medal, the Onsager Prize and the Dirac Medals of both the ICTP and the IoP.

He has demonstrated that children\u2019s logical abilities vastly exceed the estimates made by Jean Piaget, and was the first to show that preverbal infants can link visual with tactual perception. He has developed a method for testing causal hypotheses about development by combining longitudinal prediction with intervention, and has established a causal link between children\u2019s early phonological skills, in particular their sensitivity to rhyme, and their later success in reading. He has also shown that these early phonological skills depend on early learning at home.

VMichael Bevan has contributed to our understanding of the ontogeny, specificity and effector functions of cytotoxic T cells. He showed that the response to minor histocompatibility antigens is restricted by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) as previously found for virus-infected or chemically modified cells. Hence, MHC restriction is a general phenomenon encompassing normal unmodified cells and self antigens. He discovered that the specificity repertoire of T cells is selected in the thymus by self MHC-encoded antigens in a process called \u2018positive selection\u2019. He showed that dendritic cells are able to take up exogenous antigen and traffic it into the cytosol to become processed in the MHC class I presentation pathway, a process referred to as \u2018cross-priming\u2019. He showed the massive expansion of CD8+ T cells in response to infection, some of the requirements for this proliferation and the subsequent contraction and memory formation. Most recently, he has studied tissue-resident CD8+ T cell memory, which resides permanently at the site of pathogen encounter without circulating in the blood and lymphoid organs.

VRobert Fettiplace has performed studies of the mechanism of hearing in vertebrates. In 1976, Robert and Andrew Crawford developed a method of recording the electrical responses of hair cells in the isolated cochlea of reptiles. These experiments, which were the first to give extensive quantitative records from auditory receptors, showed that each hair cell is sharply tuned to a characteristic frequency and that much of the frequency selectivity in the turtle\u2019s ear can be attributed to electrical resonance in the hair cell membrane. Later work proved that the resonant frequency was set by the density and kinetics of potassium channels, the frequency increasing with a greater number of faster channels. This mechanism is present in all vertebrate classes except mammals. Another important development was the use of new methods of imaging hair cell stereociliary bundles and delivering force stimuli, providing the first demonstration of sub-micron active oscillations of the bundles. His subsequent work has focused on determining the properties, location and identity of the mechanically sensitive ion channels that transduce sound stimuli into electrical signals.

He has applied, often in a coordinated way, his exceptional skills in these disciplines to explore the subunit structure and catalytic and allosteric mechanisms of action of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase, gene amplification in the induction of drug resistance in eukaryotic cells, and the multiple mechanisms of action of interferon. He is noted for his discoveries on mechanisms of enzyme action and the multifunctional nature of biosynthetic enzymes. He discovered (independently) that drug resistance (in his case to phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate) can lead to a large increase in the number of gene copies encoding the inhibited protein. His studies on interferon action (in association with Ian M. Kerr) have provided significant insights on the modes of regulation of interferon alpha-induced gene expression and have shown that interferon leads to activation of a latent DNA binding protein. He also developed novel and sensitive methods for the modification, cleavage and analysis of proteins, especially cyanylation, and for the analysis of nucleic acids.'

The former, which grew out of collaboration with Derek Barton, includes the elegant use of organoselenium intermediates in controlled cyclisation reactions, leading to the most efficient synthesis of hirsutene and a novel synthesis of lactones and lactams via tricarbonyliron complexes, including an entirely new route to beta-lactams. This last process has been applied to the ready preparation of several pharmaceutically important compounds. The large number of total syntheses of natural products completed over the last five years include the complex ionophore indamycin X14547A and the insect antifeedants ajugarin I, polygodial and warburganal. Syntheses of azadirachtin, milbemycins and avermectins are well advanced.'

S'Azim Surani discovered genomic imprinting in 1984, and subsequently examined its mechanism and the functions of imprinted genes. He later established the genetic basis for mouse primordial germ cell (PGC) specification, using a single cell transcriptome approach. This genetic network also initiates the unique resetting of the germline epigenome, including comprehensive erasure of DNA methylation towards re-establishing full genomic potency. Epigenetic modifications and re-establishments of imprints then generate functional differences between parental genomes whilst aberrant imprints contribute to human disease.'

VPeter Clarricoats has made major contributions to applied electromagnetics in two distinct fields \u2014microwave and optical waveguides, and microwave antenna feeds. In a sustained series of analytical papers, Peter established the theory which has since been widely used in the context of optical fibres, of electromagnetic propagation on dielectric and ferrite structures. In the course of this he made two wholly unanticipated discoveries: the fact that such structures can, under some conditions, support \u2018backward waves\u2019 \u2014 waves in which the energy travels in a direction counter to the propagation of the phase fronts; and the fact that under certain conditions, guides can propagate complex modes \u2014 modes which are neither purely propagating nor purely evanescent. The performance of large antennas used in satellite communications and in radio astronomy depends critically on the form of the \u2018feed\u2019 \u2014 the radiating source which illuminates the main antenna mirror. Peter was one of the first to recognise the radical improvements which stem from the use of a corrugated horn, and presented the first detailed theoretical analysis of its action.

VAndrew Crawford is well known for his studies of the mechanism of hearing in vertebrates. In 1976, Andrew and Robert Fettiplace developed a method of recording the electrical responses of hair cells in the isolated cochlea of reptiles. These remarkable experiments, which were the first to give extensive quantitative records from auditory receptors, showed that each hair cell is sharply tuned to a characteristic frequency and that much of the frequency selectivity in the turtle\u2019s ear can be attributed to electrical resonance in the hair cell membrane. Later work proved that nerve impulses in efferent nerve fibres reduced the sensitivity and sharpness of tuning of hair cells by increasing the electrical damping. Another important result, obtained by imposing mechanical displacements, was the direct demonstration that basilar membrane vibrations of about 0.1 nanometres can be detected by the cochlea and correspond to the behavioural threshold of the animal. Andrew has also published a series of important papers on neuromuscular transmission in frogs and crabs.

He also prepared the first organometallic peroxides of most of the main group elements, and established their reaction patterns. He discovered the reactions involving bimolecular homolytic substitutions at a metal centre, developed the electron paramagnetic resonance (ESR) techniques for identification of the radicals generated, and applied these techniques very fruitfully in extensive studies of neutral free radicals.'

VGeoffrey Hewitt has produced much original work on diffusion, fluid flow and heat transfer in channels, heat exchangers and porous media, particularly for multiphase systems. In the 1960s, Geoffrey established the basic characteristics of two-phase flow and was the first to demonstrate experimentally the mechanism of \u2018burnout\u2019. The link between theory and experiment was summarised in 1970 in his well-known book with Nicholas Hall Taylor, Annular Two Phase Flow, and his book on Measurement of Two Phase Flow Parameters was published in 1978. Subsequently, Geoffrey identified for the first time the existence of \u2018disturbance waves\u2019, the dominant interfacial phenomenon in annular two-phase flow. He has made important original contributions to our understanding of droplet motion. In 1967, he initiated and since has managed the Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow Service, which provides industrial design and operating information on heat exchangers for 180 companies. He was elected President of the Heat Transfer Society in 1978, and received the 1980 Donald Q. Kern Award of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

VDerek Hull has made many contributions to the elucidation and physical modelling of aspects of the mechanics of materials, conducting pioneering work in applying concepts of materials science to the solution of urgent problems in engineering design. His early work on creep fracture of metals is seminal; he first identified and modelled the underlying mechanism (the diffusional growth of grain boundary cavities, universally known as the Hull\u2013Rimmer mechanism). With Alan Cottrell, he studied the mechanism by which intrusions form and cracks initiate, in fatigue; the Hull\u2013Cottrell mechanism explained the phenomenon in physical terms for the first time. His studies of twinning and fracture in body-centred cubic metals established the mechanism of crack initiation in these metals. He pioneered the study of fracture mechanisms in polymers and in polymer-based composites; his studies of the mechanism of craze formation on polystyrene, and of environmental effects in the fracture of glass-fibre polyester composites are particularly distinguished. He applied his understanding of the failure modes in composites materials to develop successful energy-absorbing structures for the automobile industry.

VGilbert Lonzarich has made many contributions to the field of metallic magnetism. His early experiments in Canada on the very slight temperature and pressure dependence of the de Haas\u2013van Alphen frequency in iron provided important evidence for the theoretical interpretation of the saturation magnetisation of ferromagnetics at low temperatures. Subsequently, he and his students at Cambridge made important contributions to the understanding of weak ferromagnetics such as Ni3Al and nearly ferromagnetic metals such as Ni3Ga by a combination of de Haas\u2013van Alphen and neutron scattering studies. On the basis of a novel theory of the effect of magnetic fluctuations, he succeeded in obtaining a quantitative interpretation of both the magnetic and thermal properties of such materials. Gilbert combines high skill and originality in experiment (over techniques ranging from metallurgy to electronics and computing) with a profound theoretical grasp.

He was the first to prove an important result on the dual model \u2014 the cancellation of the leading divergences between boson and fermion loops. He has made significant contributions to the theory of phase transitions, but is best known for his work, much of it in collaboration with John Schwarz, on superstring theory, including the first covariant formulation of the theory. The most important results are the proofs in 1984 and 1985 of anomaly cancellation for SO (32) and E8 x E8 superstring theories and of infinity cancellation in the SO (32) case. These definitive papers initiated the explosive growth of superstring theory, now one of the most active and exciting areas of fundamental theoretical physics.

S'Michael Moore has published many papers in statistical physics covering a wide range of topics. His early research was on the application of scaling theories to magnetic spin systems and superfluidity, and contained a series of useful results on critical indices. He then applied renormalisation group ideas to polymer solutions and clarified the relationship of this approach to previous theories; a particularly interesting result concerned the retrieval of the Flory index under approximation schemes. After some work on critical behaviour on surfaces, he joined the (then) new spin glass field, and in collaboration with Alan Bray wrote a series of important papers both on replica symmetry breaking in these systems and on their properties as revealed by computer simulation. In particular, he is associated with the droplet scaling theory of the spin glass state. In recent years, Michael has extended this work to structural glasses.'

VWarren Roper conducted important studies on organometallic and coordination chemistry, particularly of the group 8 metals. Warren did some very early work on oxidative addition reactions. Another important contribution has been the synthesis and determination of the structure of organometallic and coordination complexes containing very reactive \u2018intermediates\u2019, for example, NHO, NHOH, NH2OH, CS, CSe, CTe, CF2, CCl2, CH2O, CH2S, CH2Se, which were stabilised by coordination to metal centres. Warren has also synthesised compounds with metal to carbon triple and double bonds, and established the first example of a mononuclear zero-valent methylene complex, LnM\u2013CH2. He has studied hydride transfer reactions to coordinated nitric oxide, isocyanide and thiocarbonyl groups \u2014 reactions that are model systems for catalytic studies. He has synthesised the first metallabenzene compound, some metallacyclobutadienes, and molecules containing multiple metal\u2013phosphorus bonds. Many of Warren\u2019s pioneering contributions to synthetic chemistry have been particularly elegant and place him in the forefront of preparative organometallic and coordination chemists.

VJohn Rowell has made significant contributions to low-temperature physics and superconducting tunnelling and its applications, in particular. John made the first observation of the Josephson effect, in association with Philip W. Anderson, and noted its extreme sensitivity to magnetic fields, later utilised in interference devices (SQUIDS). He was granted the first patent describing the use of Josephson junctions as logic and memory devices. With theoretical collaborators, John converted the tunnelling characteristics of normal metal\u2013superconductor tunnel junctions into a quantitative spectroscopic technique for the investigation of electron\u2013phonon coupling. This technique has been widely exploited and has now been applied to numerous systems. This resulted in John and the late William L. McMillan being awarded the 1978 Fritz London Memorial Prize for Low Temperature Physics. John and his group have contributed to the technology of Josephson junctions and have investigated phonon spectra in metallic superlattices. His group also pioneered studies of localisation and the metal\u2013insulator transition in thin metal films and co-deposited metallic mixtures \u2014 systems which are now extensively used in this field.

VSince 1976, the crystallographic work of Michael James has concentrated increasingly on enzymes and their specific inhibitors, with special emphasis on application of techniques of the highest accuracy. He has solved the structures of a number of proteolytic enzymes and of several macromolecular enzyme inhibitors, all in complexes with their target enzymes in addition to structures of the isolated inhibitors. In addition, crystallographic studies were made of the binding of small, specific enzyme inhibitors, such as the binding of pepstatin to the aspartyl proteases and of chloromethyl ketones to the serine proteases. James\u2019s particular contribution has been towards the precision of structural results. His studies have used very accurate data at the highest resolution, usually better than 1.8 angstroms, and have employed the most critical refinement techniques, often breaking new ground. An important advance was made by the use of quantum-mechanically calculated electron density distributions in the refinement of protein structures. The impact on our understanding of enzyme catalysis, its activation and inhibition, of the role of water, and of protein evolution has been considerable.

VDavid Edwards has conducted important and wide-ranging studies of quantum fluids and solids, enhanced by the elegant application of thermodynamics. After early work at Oxford on heat conduction in superfluid helium-4, his work has been mainly with the school founded by John Daunt that he built up at Ohio State University. He made the first observations of the melting curve of helium-3\u2013helium-4 mixtures, and of the finite solubility of helium-3 in liquid helium-4 at T > 0, followed by a definitive study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of dilute helium-3\u2013helium-4 solutions. He pioneered the study of the liquid helium-4 surface, particularly the effect of small amounts of helium-3, and has also done innovative work on the liquid\u2013solid interface and the roughening transition. Recent work at millikelvin temperatures has led to the observation of collisionless spin waves in normal and superfluid helium-3.

VRenowned for his studies on the science of infrared detectors, Charles \u2018Tom\u2019 Elliott has applied this research to produce novel detectors giving civil and military thermal imager systems of world-beating performance. He has also procured and enabled their manufacture, commercial exploitation and profitable export. His invention of the SPRITE/TED (Tom Elliott Detector) device in 1974 has greatly simplified both detector fabrication and system electronics, as well as enhancing imager performance. SPRITE-based systems have proved outstandingly successful and are fitted to Tornado and Harrier aircraft in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Following from this, he has made a number of further seminal advances which, by obviating the need for cooling and mechanical scanning, should reduce system costs so that, as they become declassified, they can be used in cheap imagers for civil applications \u2014 for example, the study of novel civil engineering structures.

VNoel Hush\u2019s research focuses on the area of homogeneous and heterogeneous electron transfer. Noel was one of the first to show that electron transfer is adiabatic, or nearly so, and his theory has been experimentally confirmed for electron-transfer steps at metallic electrodes. It is now accepted also that the majority of outer sphere electron-transfer processes between ions are adiabatic. Noel recognised that electron transfer can occur by either optical or thermal mechanisms and that the corresponding rates are closely connected theoretically; Henry Taube\u2019s experimental studies have been underpinned by these theories. Significant experimental studies of mixed valence complexes and, most recently, of long-range electron transfer in biological systems demonstrate further the range of innovative contributions which Noel has made to chemical physics.

Work with his unique apparatus, which measures forces between surfaces immersed in liquids with distance resolution of 1 angstrom, has not simply confirmed modern theories, but has revealed a hierarchy of new forces due to liquid structure at interfaces at distances below 50-angstrom separation. These forces are essential to an understanding of a wide variety of phenomena in industry and nature. Jacob also pioneered the theory of self-assembly of surfactant liquid and protein molecules into structures such as micelles, vesicles and membranes.'

He predicted the occurrence of five-fold symmetry and computed the details of the diffraction patterns to be expected from such structures several years before they were observed experimentally. He is a leading authority on the geometry and symmetry of crystals and has made pioneering contributions to periodic minimal surfaces, packing in curved manifolds, and to incommensurate structures. He has elaborated the importance of the Penrose pattern for crystallography and demonstrated optically its Fourier transform. Alan has also made noteworthy use of quaternions in crystallographic calculations.

His discovery of the multiple bases of aerointolerance in bacteria has exposed the inadequacy of previous theories which sought to explain obligate anaerobiosis in terms of deprivation of a single protective agent and has led to the formulation of an equilibrium view of oxygen tolerance that has gained general acceptance. Gareth\u2019s important work on the growth and sporulation of saccharolytic clostridia has concerned particularly: effects of alien electron acceptors on fermentation mechanisms; the transport of fermentable substrates; and the properties and regulation of the membrane H+-ATPase. These studies contributed to the growing interest in biotechnological exploitation of anaerobes.

He has led a collaborative effort requiring a very high order of both theoretical and experimental technique to make, from image plane diffraction analysis (\u2018real-space crystallography\u2019) and convergent-beam diffraction, a complete system for crystallographic structure determination in the electron microscope. John is recognised as a world expert in this powerful technique.

VOur current picture of how galaxies evolve leans heavily on the work of Sidney van den Bergh. He has directed his observational studies to critical aspects of galaxy evolution. He discovered the \u2018G dwarf\u2019 problem that there are far fewer metal-poor stars that would be expected from simple theories of galactic evolution. His studies of the chemical abundances of supernova remnants have given direct evidence that the interstellar gas is being enriched in metals by these events. The photometric system he introduced is well adapted to determine the chemical and physical properties of stars. Using the 200-inch Palomar telescope, he made the pioneering study of the globular cluster system of the Andromeda galaxy and deduced that these clusters were systematically more metal-rich than those around our galaxy. He has catalogued and pioneered the field of dwarf galaxies, discovered three new companions of Andromeda and invented the standard luminosity classification scheme for spiral and irregular galaxies. His studies have made him an authority on extragalactic distances.

With others, he demonstrated that the small subunit of RuBisCo is synthesised as a precursor on free cytoplasmic ribosomes and uncovered many of the details of its subsequent transport into the chloroplast. His laboratory demonstrated that the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter can be used to transcribe heterologous coding sequences in transgenic plants. This strong, constitutive promoter has become an important tool in basic plant biology research and is also widely used to express transgenic traits in crops.

VJames Fitzsimons's experimental demonstration of the important involvement of the renin-angiotensin system in the control of thirst and sodium appetite is a landmark in our understanding of the physiological basis of thirst. He has found that angiotensin II acts both peripherally and in the brain to stimulate fluid and electrolyte intake. Studies on the central actions of renin and angiotensin have defined probable hypothalamic targets for these effects and suggested the involvement of an intrinsic renin-angiotensin generating system in brain. His work helps to illuminate the functional organisation of the hypothalamus and vegetative functions in general, and suggests the possible physical basis of a motivational state. He received a Docteur honoris causa en Médecine de l'Université de Lausanne, Suisse in 1978, and the Distinguished Career Award of the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior in 1998.

He has pioneered an approach which combines carefully designed laboratory experiments with theoretical models and synoptic accounts of other field and laboratory data to elucidate how individual biological components of the interactions between and within species affect the persistence and abundance of populations. Importantly, he has drawn together theoretical models, short-term experiments and long-term population studies to show that the interplay between spatial heterogeneity and behavioural variability within populations has a crucial influence on the dynamics of many insect populations.

VTerence Mansfield is noted for his contributions to the physiology of stomata and especially the chemical aspects of stomatal mechanism, often made in collaboration with his students in the active and successful research school in plant physiology that he established in 1967. His important findings include the discovery of a new \u2018low energy\u2019 light effect on stomata, with maximum sensitivity at 700 nanometres, 0.1 Jm-2s-1 being effective in shifting the phase of an endogenous rhythm in darkness. With a research student he also discovered that abscisic acid (ABA) acts as a stress hormone, suppressing stomatal opening with concomitant prevention of K+ uptake and starch hydrolysis in the guard cells. A simple bioassay was developed, sensitive from 10-11 to 10-4 M ABA, which was also suitable for other substances with \u2018antitranspirant\u2019 properties; one of these (all-trans-farnesol) was discovered in drought-stressed Sorghum leaves. He has also made other important advances in techniques for the study of stomata, both in intact leaves and in isolated epidermis.

Bryan discovered the soil transmission and nematode vectors of several nepoviruses and tobraviruses and provided evidence for the importance of virus coat proteins in nematode transmissibility. He established many salient features of the ecology of these viruses and methods for their control. He showed nepoviruses to have a bipartite RNA genome; that the larger part can replicate independently; and discovered a genome-linked protein important for infectivity. Bryan showed that larger particles of tobraviruses are infective and mostly accumulate earlier in infection than the shorter ones. He discovered potato mop-top virus and its transmission by Spongospora subterranea. He also discovered circular single-stranded DNA genomes in two plant viruses. He applied modern taxonomic methods (with Adrian Gibbs) for the delineation of groups of plant viruses.'

VJohn Pettigrew is outstanding for the number of new directions of research he has initiated in the comparative and developmental physiology of the senses in vertebrates. He was the first to demonstrate that neurons in the striate cortex are selective for binocular disparity. He has shown that the binocular visual system of the owl, though very different anatomically, shares many functional and developmental properties with cats and monkeys. He showed that nonvisual (nor-adrenergic) pathways influence the \u2018critical period\u2019 for development of binocular neurons in the striate cortex. He demonstrated that owls have an auditory map of sound source location in their midbrains. He is quick to appreciate the ecological and evolutionary significance of these discoveries, each of which has opened up a fertile new area of investigation, and he continues to elucidate new problems in the visual, auditory and somatosensory systems of a wide range of vertebrates.

His examination of centrifugal distortion effects led to a reduction in the number of parameters for asymmetric top molecules, to the discovery of clustering in high levels of spherical tops, and to the prediction of forbidden rotational spectra in certain nonpolar molecules, including methane. His most recent work includes the theory of the Jahn\u2013Teller effect in the Rydberg states of H3 and D3.

VBruce Cattanach has made important contributions to the genetics of mammalian sex determination and differentiation, X-chromosome inactivation, chromosome imprinting and experimental mutagenesis. Bruce\u2019s X-autosome translocation, which he discovered and investigated, has been used worldwide in studies of X-chromosome action. With it he showed that the phenomenon of position effect variegation is due to variable reactivation of previously inactivated loci. It gave him the first evidence of the Xce locus, which affects the choice of X for inactivation, and probably represents the inactivation centre. He discovered and studied the sex-reversed mutation, Sxr, which has provided important information on the roles of the X and Y chromosomes in germ cells, and evidence of meiotic crossing-over between X and Y. Another mutant, hypogonadal (hpg), deficient in gonadotrophin-releasing factor, has been a valuable tool in studies of the hypothalamic gonadotrophin-releasing system. A recent finding is a chromosome imprinting effect, leading to complementary phenotypes in mice with maternal or paternal disomy for particular chromosomes. He was the first to study chemical mutagenesis in the mouse.

S'Werner Israel has conducted important work in general relativity, particularly on black holes and relativistic thermodynamics. He proved the unexpected theorem that a non-rotating black hole must be spherically symmetric. His theorem initiated a chain of results which led to the complete description of black hole equilibrium states by known solutions. This opened a new era in black hole theory by making it possible to perform detailed calculations. He has also shown how to treat thin shells of matter in general relativity and has developed a theory of transport coefficients in relativistic thermodynamics which does not lead to propagation faster than light.'

VCharles Stirling has made important contributions to physical organic chemistry through his elucidation of organic reaction mechanisms. His early examination of the reactions of organosulfur compounds developed into a wide-ranging investigation of several types of reaction. These types form a part of the mechanistic foundation of modern organic chemistry. The reaction types which he has studied include additions, eliminations, cyclisations, and ring cleavage reactions. Most recently these have included reactions in surfaces. He reported the first comprehensive study of nucleophilic additions alkenes and  in kinetic investigations of cyclisation reactions involving intramolecular nucleophilic substitutions, has shown that widely accepted classical generalisations concerning this type of cyclisation reaction are incorrect. The concept of nucleofugality (the tendency of an atom or group to depart with its bonding electron pair), which he proposed, has proved to be extremely useful in leading to an understanding of the influence of structure upon heterolytic reactions. His most recent work has concentrated on intermolecular interactions and the morphology and behaviour of multifunctional molecules in surfaces.

Particularly notable were the first proposal of three jet structure (subsequently seen experimentally) as a gluon signal, and the first precise application of the renormalization group to grand unified theories, with the first precise estimate of sin2 \u03b8 W. Works on the theory of CP violation, on the phenomenology of the Higgs boson, and on the implications of grand unified theories for the generation of baryon number in the early Universe, have also attracted much attention. His gift for communication (his summer school lectures and reviews are models of their kind), and his special concern with the experimental implications of topical theories, make him a key figure in the discussion of new high-energy physics projects.

VNevin Hughes-Jones has conducted important studies of the kinetics of antigen\u2013antibody reactions, applied to red blood cells. He was the first to devise a method for quantitating red blood cell antibodies in absolute terms (micrograms per millilitre) \u2014 a development which was of considerable importance, since it made it possible to discover the minimum dose of anti-rhesus (anti-Rh) needed for the suppression of Rh immunisation and thereby greatly facilitated the extension of anti-Rh treatment to all women at risk of immunisation following pregnancy. Nevin has also made important quantitative studies of the activation of the classical complement pathway. He has shown that the binding of C1q is not necessarily accompanied by C1 activation and went on to identify the conditions of C1 binding that do result in C1 activation, thus making a real contribution to understanding of the way in which antigen\u2013antibody reactions lead to complement activation.

He elucidated the relationship between temporal and spatial instabilities by means of a group velocity and made a quantitative prediction of the development of waves in growing boundary layers. He has measured the evolution of localised wave packets and demonstrated a substantial measure of agreement with his theory. He has shed valuable light on aspects of leading edge separation on thin wings, especially on the question of transition to turbulence and reattachment. He has also made important contributions to problems of vortex shedding, turbulent wedges and the spectral analysis of random signals. His work is marked by a unification of theoretical ideas with experiment, partly brought about by ingenious use of computational methods.

In association with Derek Barton, he participated in a long series of publications on tetracycline synthesis, on the photolytic elimination of thionobenzoate esters and on the chemistry of N(SPh)3. His synthetic work on terpenoids involves the synthesis of (\u2013)-neoverbanol, of grandisol, of (+)-hinesol and of 10-epi-(+)-hinesol. He is especially noted for his development of novel organosilicon reagents. Particularly striking are the elegant and short syntheses of R-(+)-frontalin and of oestrone. In addition, Philip was the first to construct primary helical molecules, the helixanes. He is one of the most fertile and gifted of the younger synthetic chemists.

In systems theory, David developed computational methods for minimal realisations, and contributed to an extension of the Weierstrass excess-function theorem. His best known work is the development of computer algorithms for the optimisation of stochastic and deterministic systems, with proofs of existence and convergence. He has developed two different approaches to the design of control systems, and has implemented these as interactive computing methods. In addition, he has made a number of contributions to finite-dimensional optimisation, and has participated in a range of projects in which his own and other methods have been used to solve industrial problems of control.

He was a member of the group that first demonstrated the physical integration of the DNA sequences of SV40 and other polyoma viruses into the chromosomes of the cells they transform. He subsequently defined the sequences which are necessary and sufficient to effect malignant transformation, and was a pioneer in the use of restriction enzymes for the physical mapping of mutations in adenovirus. He was the first to analyse the DNA sequences of the integration sites of SV40, work that confirmed the \u2018onion skin\u2019 model of excision. Joseph also analysed the expression of influenza virus haemagglutinin from genes cloned in SV40 vectors and studied the factors influencing the transport of haemagglutinin to the cell surface by in vitro modification of the genes.

S'Ian Percival has conducted work in both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. He has studied relationships between quantal and classical systems and his work on fundamental theoretical problems has had many practical applications. He has introduced the notion of correspondence identities, elucidated their connection with dynamical symmetries and used them in the first applications of Monte Carlo trajectory methods to atomic collisions and to microwave ionisation of atoms. With the aid of new correspondence principle techniques, he has obtained accurate electron-impact cross sections essential for the interpretation of radio recombination line observations. He introduced the notions of regular and irregular spectra, thus initiating the study of quantum chaos and is application to molecules. His important contributions to quantal collision theory include studies of bounds, of the polarisation of impact radiation and of non-iterative techniques for the solution of integro-differential equations. He has made outstanding contributions to the theory of nonlinear, non-integrable Hamiltonian systems. These include the development of Fourier methods to distinguish regular and chaotic motion.'

VMartin Raff has conducted important work on the development, function and cell biology of lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) and neural cells. He introduced cell-surface markers to identify and separate mouse T and B cells \u2014 Thy-1 for T cells and surface immunoglobulin for B cells. With John Owen and Max Cooper, he identified the origin of B cells and discovered their immediate precursors (pre-B cells). With Stefanello de Petris, he discovered ligand-induced redistribution of cell-surface components (\u2018patching\u2019, \u2018capping\u2019, and endocytosis), with important implications for understanding cell membrane structure and cell signalling.

S'William Hill is distinguished for his theoretical contributions to the study of the population and quantitative genetics of finite populations, in particular with respect to multilocus problems. He was the first to present formulae for the expected association of linked genes in finite populations due to random sampling of gametes and for the estimation of these associations from genotype frequencies. He has made major contributions to the analysis of quantitative variation in random breeding populations, both in the design and interpretation of selection experiments and in the analysis of similarity between relatives. He has applied these concepts in his own selection experiments in the laboratory and in farm animal improvement programmes.'

He has also made important contributions to observational techniques. In many highly successful rocket and satellite flights, he carried out significant studies of the solar corona and flares, of binary systems and supernova remnants, and of extragalactic objects. He obtained the first high time resolution observations of solar flare iron lines showing by a penetrating theoretical analysis the importance of conductive cooling in flare\u2013plasma ratio dependence on electron density in the corona. He produced the first X-ray map of the supernova remnants Cassiopeia A and Puppis A, demonstrated that the radiation from the latter was generated in shock-heated interstellar clouds and found an emission line of oxygen VIII from Puppis A. Leonard\u2019s work has established him as a leader of international repute in his subject.

As early as 1955, John pioneered the application of gas chromatography to gas kinetics and subsequently made significant contributions to the elucidation of the mechanism of the slow combustion of hydrocarbons and of the role of vibrationally excited free radicals in the chlorination of olefins. From 1964, he initiated new work on band-spreading mechanisms in chromatography, which had an important effect on the development of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) over the next decade. Subsequently, he made further contributions, both theoretical and experimental to the understanding and improvement of HPLC techniques and, supported by a substantial grant from the Wolfson Foundation, stimulated industrial developments in this field.'

He was the first to grow insect forms of African trypanosomes in a defined culture medium and this led to the discovery of the threonine pathway for the generation of acetate in trypanosomes. He subsequently established amino acid sequences for surface coat antigens from distinct variants of Trypanosoma brucei and characterised the gene sequences which control the synthesis of these variant antigens. This work revealed unique signal sequences at both ends of the polypeptide and novel glycosylation of C-terminal serine or aspartic acid residues of the antigens. Protective antigens from a murine malaria parasite have been identified and isolated and this work has advanced progress towards the production of a vaccine against blood-stage malaria.

VMalcolm Ferguson-Smith\u2019s significant contributions to human genetics and cytogenetics range from early studies applying the sex chromatin method to the analysis of intersexual states, to genome mapping through the use of chromosome rearrangements. Malcolm was the first to report the now familiar phenomenon of satellite association, the 48 XXXY karyotype, and the specificity of location of secondary constrictions in the human chromosome set. His contributions to the knowledge of human meiosis have been of the highest quality and he was the first to succeed in identifying the characteristic cross configurations expected at pachytene in subjects heterozygous for a reciprocal translocation. Malcolm is also the author of a provocative hypothesis concerning the location of the basic genetic lesion in Turner\u2019s syndrome, the genetic causation of XX masculinity and true hermaphroditism (by transference of a masculinising segment of Y to the X chromosome), and the nonrandom distribution of break points in spontaneous structural rearrangements. He has been a pioneer of methods for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disease.

S'Donald Metcalf studies the control of proliferation and differentiation in normal and leukaemic blood cells. His pioneering work demonstrated the regulatory control of the thymus on other lymphoid populations and the autonomous intrathymic control systems regulating lymphocyte formation. His development of a series of semi-solid cloning systems for various normal and leukaemic blood-forming precursors initiated a large new field of cell biology. He demonstrated the existence of a family of glycoprotein regulators (CSFs) each controlling the proliferation and differentiation of a specific haematopoietic family of cells. He purified two of these and characterised their action biochemically. He demonstrated that all myeloid leukaemias in humans are CSF dependent and that in murine models, myeloid leukaemia can be suppressed by using normal haematopoietic regulators to force terminal differentiation.'

S'Ralph Lainson is well known his work on parasitic protozoa, especially leishmania. His greatest contribution has been the elucidation of the Leishmania complex in Latin America whereby the identification and epidemiology of the different subspecies have led to a new approach to the subject. Since 1965, from the small but highly productive Wellcome Parasitology Unit in Amazonia, he has carried out extensive field and laboratory studies on the vertebrate and sandfly hosts of the parasite, incriminating and identifying new vectors, new animal reservoirs and new forms of Leishmania. He has shown that the pathology and prognosis of human leishmania infections, apparently so variable, depend upon the particular subspecies of parasite involved and scientific methods can now be applied to reduce the incidence of this largely incurable and mutilating tropical disease. Ralph is a protozoologist whose brilliant work has enabled him to unravel difficult problems also in malaria, toxoplasmosis, coccidiosis and other parasitic infections; he has described many new species in reptiles, birds and mammals in temperate and tropical regions.'

VMichael Hart has seized the opportunity presented by the manufacture of highly perfect crystals for the semiconductor industry to develop entirely new techniques in X-ray optics, with great advances in sensitivity and precision. In 1965, with Ulrich Bonse, he originated X-ray interferometry. He has developed applications thereof to metrology for distances ranging from micrometres to picometres. He has made absolute precision determinations of lattice parameter, structure factors, and dispersion corrections for silicon and germanium. From these follow a redetermination of Avogadro\u2019s number and improved delineation of electron density in these crystals. He has developed methods employing multiple reflection (and multiple sources) which permit intercomparison of lattice spacing between various crystals in 1 part to 109. His very sensitive qualitative and quantitative tests for crystal perfection and lattice parameter variation give information on residual impurities important for the semiconductor industry, and have enabled him to make substantial improvements in instruments and technique for X-ray and gamma-ray spectroscopy. He received, in 1970, jointly with Ulrich  Bonse, the American Crystallographic Association\u2019s B. E. Warren Award for Diffraction Physics.

He convincingly demonstrated that the age of the sea floor controls its depth, and then used this empirical relationship to investigate the thermal structure of plates, to work out the evolution of the Central Eastern Pacific where magnetic anomalies could not be recognised and to produce paleobathymetric maps. This use of plate tectonics to understand oceanic bathymetry is one of his major successes. His other major contribution concerns the complicated evolution of the Indian Ocean. This work produced an evolutionary framework from magnetic anomalies which he among others confirmed by drilling, and later lead to new ideas about the evolution of aseismic ridges. He also made important contributions to understanding the evolution of margin basins, and the hydrothermal circulation in the oceanic crust.'

VP. James Peebles\u2019s wide-ranging contributions to physical cosmology have established him as the leading exponent of this subject in his generation. In the early 1960s, he began to investigate galaxy formation and helium synthesis on the hypothesis that the Universe originated as a hot dense \u2018primordial fireball\u2019. Had it not been for this prior theoretical work, the cosmological significance of Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson\u2019s serendipitous detection of \u2018excess antenna temperature at 4080 megahertz\u2019 would have been less readily appreciated. He has calculated in detail how various types of initial inhomogeneity may amplify (or decay) in an expanding universe, with reference to galaxy formation and the possible detectability of anisotropies in the background radiation. He has also investigated the detectability of \u2018young\u2019 galaxies, and offered compelling arguments for \u2018missing mass\u2019 in galactic halos and clusters.

Their significance lies in the test they offer of any general framework solutions to statistical thermodynamics. In this respect, they have played a role similar to that of Lars Onsager\u2019s solution of the two-dimensional Ising model, 70 years ago. The solution of such classical problems as the eight-vertex model and the Potts model, and the discovery of models whose critical indices vary with interaction parameters are major contributions to the mathematical framework of physics and chemistry. This work gained Rodney the Boltzmann Prize of the IUPAP for 1980.

VDavid Brink has contributed significantly to our understanding of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions. These contributions have established him as an original, energetic and resourceful nuclear theorist. His name is associated with fluctuation cross-sections, dipole strength functions, giant dipole oscillations of closed shells, generator coordinate methods for structure and reactions, angular momentum selection rules in ion\u2013ion reactions and adiabatic time-dependent Hartree\u2013Fock theory. Particularly admired is his work showing that almost all essential nuclear data can be reproduced with Hartree\u2013Fock theory and a simple effective interaction; equally striking are his studies, pursued with remarkable insight, of the interplay between single-particle motion and between single-particle motion and cluster structure.

He developed a new method for investigating phospholipid structure with which he obtained the first reliable analysis of membrane phospholipids and discovered and characterised 11 additional phospholipids. He recognised the complexity of the polyphosphoinositide fraction in the brain, and isolated triphosphoinositide, and showed that the movement of phospholipids between cell membranes could be effected by exchange proteins existing in the cytoplasm.'

High polymers are produced by the copper-catalysed air oxidation of phenols, amines, thiols or ketones. Both the reaction and the mechanism by which it proceeds were new. The discovery stemmed from some of his basic ideas for the direct oxidation of organic compounds, and the research team he led went on to study the mechanism of oxidation.

VChristopher Graham has conducted meticulous and highly original studies on early mammalian embryos. He devised an effective way of producing parthenogenetic activation of mouse eggs in vitro, the first to allow a choice between haploid and diploid development. This work established that neither the maternal tract nor the fertilising sperm is necessary for histogenesis, since even haploid parthenogenones produce all tissue types. His studies on the cell cycle were the first to show that genes may be expressed in mammals even at the two-cell stage. He demonstrated, by ingenious reaggregation experiments, that at least the first stages of embryonic differentiation are regulated by cell position within the embryo rather than by inherited morphogenetic determinants. This finding, termed by him \u2018inside\u2013outside\u2019 differentiation, is central to our present concept of early development. His ongoing studies of teratocarcinoma cells as a model for the normal embryo continue to emphasise the importance of the microenvironment in directing differentiation.

VNorman Green has made important and highly original contributions to the study of protein\u2013protein interactions and interactions between proteins and biologically active small molecules. He established that the interaction between trypsin and several protein inhibitors was competitive with substrate rather than non-competitive as had been previously suggested. He also devised methods generally applicable to the measurement of kinetics of protein\u2013protein interactions of very low dissociation constants. He showed that the hydroxylation of collagen proline was completed after its incorporation into the protein and before the collagen left the endoplasmic reticulum. This was followed by a decade of intensive research on the binding of biotin to avidin and the introduction of highly sensitive spectrophotometric techniques for the study of biotinyl enzymes. In particular, he made the important discovery that each of the four subunits of avidin bound its biotin independently of the occupancy of the other sites buried within the molecule, and that the quaternary structure of the protein was not essential for the formation of the binding site.

He also established the properties of nucleotide analogues such as tubercidin and formycin. Edward has developed the observation that tumour cells release fibrinolytic activity with a thorough study of both the release of plasminogen activators from cells and the relationship of this fibrinolytic activity to such fundamental matters as cell migration and inflammation, neoplasia, viral cell transformation, the release of the ovum at ovulation, trophoblast implantation and embryonic modelling. He has purified nicotinic receptors and carried out extensive studies of the binding of drugs to them.'

VKenneth Pounds has made important contributions to solar and cosmic X-ray astronomy both as a very able and innovative experimentalist and by vigorous leadership of the group he established at Leicester. He pioneered the use of space techniques for this work, playing a major role in introducing proportional counting for spectral studies, pulse length discrimination for signal/noise ratio improvement, Bragg crystal spectroscopy, the employment of balanced filter techniques and in applying the microchannel multiplier combined with a two-dimensional readout system to achieve resolutions of a few arc seconds on the US \u2018Einstein\u2019 satellite. These developments enabled him to make the first direct measurements of solar broadband X-ray spectra and to obtain most of the early high-resolution data. He was quick to perceive the value of very simple rocket experiments for sky-surveys and so carried out the first UK cosmic X-ray observation discovering early evidence for the transience of some sources. Kenneth\u2019s research, leadership, accuracy of scientific judgement and astute perception of the current problems have gained for him a well-deserved international reputation.

VThrough his contributions to the neurochemistry of synaptic transmitters, Leslie Iversen has placed the study of uptake processes for noradrenaline on a quantitative basis and has discovered a second non-neuronal uptake which leads to a rapid metabolic degradation of the accumulated amines. He has exploited uptake processes in the study of the turnover of catecholamines and other synaptic transmitters and as a basis of an electron microscopic radioautographic method for delineating the transmitter specificity of terminal boutons. By this means, it was shown that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was taken up by a clearly defined subpopulation of nerve terminals distributed throughout the central nervous system. A selective loss of GABA-containing cells has been found in the basal ganglia of patients with Huntingdon\u2019s chorea. Leslie (with Ed Kravitz, Masanori Otsuka and Zach Hall) was the first to demonstrate that GABA was released from inhibitory nerve terminals. He has demonstrated trans-synaptic regulation of enzymes concerned with transmitter biosynthesis and has carried out extensive studies of the effect of nerve growth factor on the biochemistry of sympathetic neurons.

VLouis Siminovitch\u2019s first major contribution to biology was to demonstrate, with André Lwoff, that prophages could be induced by ultraviolet light. His further work on bacteriophages included the isolation of a large spectrum of bacteriophage lamda mutants that affect morphogenesis and the exploitation of these mutants to delineate, for the first time, nearly all of the proteins involved in lamda morphogenesis. Turning to the study of somatic mammalian cells, he developed methods for culturing such cells in suspension and for their karyotypic analysis by the air-drying technique. He demonstrated that there was little turnover of DNA in cell cultures growing logarithmically under controlled conditions. He was closely involved in the development of the spleen colony method for studying haematopoiesis, and he showed that the differentiation of blood cells occurs by stochastic processes that can be affected by mutations involving either the stem cells themselves or the host. He has also made important contributions to somatic cell genetics, especially in the isolation and study of conditional lethal mutants.

His work has provided much of the foundation for the conversion of various industrial arts to exact and quantitative sciences. His approach has been characterised by simple but ingenious experiments and an insistence on quantitative measurements. For elucidating the mechanism by which phenols and amines inhibit autoxidation he won the 1968 American Chemical Society Award in Petroleum Chemistry. His subsequent work has been mainly concerned with uninhibited autoxidations, the mechanism of radical\u2013radical reactions and, most recently, the formation of novel types of long-lived free radicals. He has published one book and over 150 scientific papers.

The recent revival of the theory of finite groups, and above all the exciting progress towards the determination of all finite simple groups, would have been impossible without his deep and original methods. His series of six very substantial papers, Nonsolvable Finite Groups all of whose Local Subgroups are Solvable, in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society and the Pacific Journal of Mathematics, in which he determines all \u2018minimal\u2019 finite simple groups, are particularly notable.

He has pioneered the important and fruitful concepts of deformation and fracture maps, which display in a single field the area of dominance of specific flow and fracture mechanisms. These are most useful to engineers, metallurgists, ceramists and geologists. More recently, his focus has been on systematic methods for materials selection to meet criteria of engineering design, environmental stewardship and sustainable development.

S'Bernard Shaw has conducted pioneering work on the chemistry of organotransition metal compounds, especially pi-allylic compounds and transition metal hydride complexes. He has contributed greatly to our understanding of the bonding, stereochemistry, directional electronic effects, and mechanisms of reactions involved. He showed that transition metal complexes with bulky tertiary phosphine ligands have remarkable physical properties and unusual chemical and catalytic reactivity. The valuable concept of oxidative addition has been introduced for the synthesis of a wide range of complexes of platinum, iridium, or rhodium, and the first clear-cut examples provided of allylic bridges between two metal atoms. Subsequently, the chemistry of pi-allylic complexes has been extensively and usefully developed. He described the first carboxylate-bridged allylic-palladium and rhodium complexes, and these have since been much used in synthesis. He has also made a major contribution to the chemistry of transition metal complexes, now often used or postulated as catalytic intermediates in hydrocarboxylation or hydrosilylation, for example, and in major industrial processes such as olefin isomerisation, hydroformylation, and homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation.'

VEdwin Taylor made significant contributions to our understanding of biological motile systems. The biochemical investigation of microtubule systems was opened up by Edwin\u2019s demonstration in 1965 that colchicine, a known inhibitor of the anaphase movement of chromosomes, is strongly bound to cells containing microtubules or organelles such as mitotic spindles, cilia, and sperm tails composed of them. This discovery led to the recognition of tubulin by Edwin and his collaborators in 1967, and to a large field of later work in which he continued to play an important part. He then turned to muscle, and his investigations by rapid reaction methods published in 1969\u201371 established that the hydrolysis of ATP by myosin proceeds by the rapid binding and cleavage of substrate, followed by slow release of products. This again stimulated a whole new field of investigation. This analysis of the enzymatic action of myosin is central to all present-day theories of muscular contraction. Edwin has also made important contributions to the study of actomyosin systems in motile cells other than muscle.

VRonald Gillespie has conducted highly original work on the reactions which occur, and the species which are formed, in strong acid media. In his classical work on the sulphuric acid solvent system, he demonstrated the ways in which simple physico\u2013chemical techniques (especially cryoscopy) could be used to obtain new and fundamental information on the nature of dissolved organic and inorganic substances. In recent years, this work has developed into a study of even more highly acidic systems (for example, fluorosulfuric acid) now commonly called the \u2018super-acid\u2019 media, and this has led directly to the characterisation of new families of compounds (notably of sulfur, the halogens, selenium, tellurium, krypton and xenon) which often contain polyatomic cations, which has not been recognised in other media. New carbonium ion species have also been prepared and studied in these liquids.

VMartin Bott has conducted investigations into gravity anomalies related to granitic intrusions and into methods for discriminating them from anomalies due to concealed sedimentary basins. His results throw new light upon the mechanism of emplacement of acid igneous intrusions in the Earth\u2019s crust. His prediction that a buried granite must be present beneath Weardale was substantiated by deep boring. He has elucidated problems of crustal dynamics in terms of ductile flow of isostatic origin in the upper mantle, and has proposed a new explanation for cyclic sedimentation. Since the advent of digital computers, he has developed a wide range of computer techniques for the interpretation of gravity and magnetic anomalies, of very general applicability. His classic earlier studies of crustal structure in northern England and the Cornubian peninsular have been extended offshore, notably to the Irish Sea, the continental shelf area north west of Scotland, and the Iceland\u2013Faroe ridge, contributing to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the North Atlantic basin and margins in the vicinity of the British Isles.

His book on tensor properties of crystals is a standard work. In glaciology, he formulated the tensor-invariant generalisation of Glen\u2019s nonlinear flow law for ice that forms the basis for modern glacier mechanics and explained, from his own field work, the origin of waves below ice falls. He also revealed how veins of water at three-grain junctions in temperate polycrystalline ice control its thermal behaviour.

S'Michael Whelan conducted pioneering work to develop the transmission electron microscopy technique for the study of defects in crystals. He was responsible both for establishing many of the basic experimental techniques, and for the theories of image contrast essential for the detailed interpretation of the micrographs. His treatment of image contrast from a stacking fault based on the dynamical theory of electron diffraction forms the basis of all subsequent work on image contrast from defects. Together with Archie Howie, he was responsible for developing the theory of image contrast from dislocations, and he has also made important contributions to the understanding of absorption and inelastic scattering of electrons in crystals. He pioneered the development of a combined electron microscope and energy analyser for carrying out microanalysis on a very fine scale. His electron microscope study of dislocation reactions in face-centred cubic metals established and extended an important aspect of dislocation theory. He also developed the first direct method for measuring stacking fault energy (from the curvature of dislocations at nodes).'

In his paper with Jason Morgan on the geometry of the motion of three plates on a sphere, he found a beautiful explanation of the \u2018great magnetic bight\u2019 in the Pacific, which had been one of the principle difficulties in the acceptance of plate tectonics. Dan\u2019s other papers have studied the cooling of a plate after it is formed on the ridge axis, and accounted for the broad variations of ocean depth and heat flow across a ridge. His interests also include the theory of convection in the mantle, and the generation of magma, its separation from its source regions and its geochemistry.

VRoger Short has made key contributions to our understanding of the endocrinology and physiology of reproduction, especially of the comparative aspects of reproduction in mammals. Having developed methods for measuring progesterone and other steroidal sex hormones in blood and tissues, Roger investigated and defined hormonal changes associated with normal oestrus, pregnancy and parturition, and with certain endocrine disorders such as the Stein\u2013Leventhal syndrome. He discovered 20-beta-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one in equine placental tissue and isolated 19-norandros-tenedione and 6-alpha-hydroxyoestradiol-17-beta from equine follicular fluid. He developed the new \u2018two-cell type\u2019 concept of ovarian function, based on the observation that the theca interna and granulosa cells of the Graafian follicle differ in their steroid biosynthetic potential. He made substantial contributions to the knowledge of the mechanism underlying sex determination, intersexuality and the endocrine control of sexual behaviour, both in domesticated and wild animals. His scientific achievements have been recognised by medals from both the Zoological Society of London and the Society for Endocrinology.

This work has had a decisive influence on the wide acceptance of the ideas of sea floor spreading and continental drift. He also examined the rocks of the Troodos mountains in Cyprus, and showed, following the work of Ian Gass and others, that these rocks are a specimen of an ancient sea floor showing the mantle overlain by gabbros, dykes, pillow lavas and deep-sea sediments.

VDavid Turner\u2019s principal contribution has been the invention and exploitation of the technique of molecular photoelectron spectroscopy. This method of studying molecular energy levels has proved to be of great importance in our understanding of molecular orbitals and is developing into a very significant new branch of chemical spectroscopy. David has also made important contributions to the techniques of magnetic resonance and to our knowledge of the spectra of organic vapours in the vacuum ultraviolet.

Hall on the attenuation of second sound in rotating liquid helium provided the first demonstration of the probable existence of quantized vortex lines. Later, he gave the first direct proof that the circulation was quantised.

S'Ronald Whittam conducted important studies of the mechanism of active transport of ions in animal tissues. He demonstrated the special asymmetry of the ATPase of the red blood cell membrane, which acts only when Na+ is inside and K+ is outside the membrane. He was the first to demonstrate that active transport can exert a feedback control over the rate of cellular metabolism. These concepts, of directionality as an inherent part of an enzyme reaction in membranes, are of fundamental significance for the understanding of the relations between physiological function and the mechanism of enzyme action.'

VJohn Ramsay has conducted important research into the structural history of metamorphic rocks and the theoretical implications of rock deformation. His field studies of Moine\u2013Lewisian rocks in northwest Scotland, the Moodies and Swaziland systems in eastern Transvaal and the structural design of the western Alps showed how complex tectonic histories can be deciphered by geometrically controlled analysis of the relationship between small and large-scale features. They established him as one of the foremost structural geologists in the world today. The theoretical aspects of his work include, in particular, investigations into the geometry and mechanism of folds and the restoration of successions to their unfolded state. This research led to a new understanding of the effects of multiphase plastic deformation. His book on the folding and fracturing of rocks is the most authoritative work yet published on tectonic analysis.

VFrancis Farley has measured with great accuracy the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, which has led to a marked extension toward short distances and high-momentum transfers of the verified range of validity of quantum electrodynamics. For this purpose, he has developed ingenious methods for the storage of muons in a magnetic field. He has made important contributions also to the accurate determination of other properties of the muon, to the study of cosmic rays, nuclear reactions and cloud formation and to the development of fast counting methods. Francis\u2019 work on the velocity of gamma rays emitted in the decay of pi-to-infinity mesons has led to an accurate verification of the second postulate of special relativity for source velocities near the velocity of light while a by-product of his work on the storage of muons has led to the establishment of the relativistic time dilation effect (so-called clock paradox) for accelerated systems.

S"Roger Penrose has conducted outstanding research in pure mathematics and theoretical physics. He is popularly known for his work on singularities, such as black holes, which he proved can arise from the gravitational collapse of massive, dying stars. He has also made important contributions that explore possible connections between physics and consciousness, and set these out in best-selling books such as The Emperor's New Mind (1989)."

For instance, if such a polynomial of odd degree has enough variables, it will certainly have a rational zero.'

VJohn Gurdon is a Nobel Prize-winning developmental biologist who performed pioneering research on nuclear transplantation and cloning. In his seminal experiment, John replaced the nucleus of a frog egg with the nucleus of a mature cell from the tadpole intestine. The resulting embryo grew into a healthy clone of the tadpole \u2014 indicating that, despite their specialisation, the nuclei of adult cells still hold the potential to become any other type of cell.
