S'Professor Barbara Howlett is a leading international fungal plant pathologist. She discovered that disease-related genes are often located in unstable parts of the fungal genome, where gene loss and mutations readily occur. This explains how disease resistance, deliberately bred into crops, can rapidly break down in the field. The practical applications of her discovery have had a major impact on the viability and profitability of the Australian canota industry. She also discovered novel biosynthetic pathways for classes of fungal toxins that are important in diseases of both plants and animals.'

S'Jane Visvader is a leading Australian molecular and cellular biologist who has greatly clarified breast development and the role of stem cell biology in breast cancer. In a remarkable discovery, her team identified and isolated the stem cell that generates the entire breast. Her work also defined the cellular hierarchy within the breast, identified master regulators that orchestrate its differentiation program, and discovered that certain types of breast cancer originate from specific progenitor cells. The results of her research have profound implications for understanding the cellular origins of both normal and cancerous epithelial tissues.'

Using the genetically defined flax-flax rust system, he isolated the first rust avirulence protein and showed it is secreted into the host plant cell during infection. Dodds showed that this pathogen protein triggers immunity by direct protein-protein interaction with a host resistance protein. He resolved the crystal structure of the avirulence protein and identified polymorphic surface residues as the keys for specific recognition. This work provided the first evidence for a postulate, based on the long standing gene-for-gene hypothesis that direct and specific protein interactions occurred between flax resistance and flax rust avirulence proteins. Dodds' innovative discoveries provide a foundation for the rational design of synthetic rust resistance genes to protect the world's most important food crops from rust diseases."

S'Allen\xe2\x80\x99s early work culminated in the demonstration that intracellular calcium was the central regulator of activation in the heart. From these fundamental findings, Allen elucidated the role of calcium in the cardiac length-tension relation, unravelled the role of calcium in cardiac ischaemia and identified a new pacemaker current that regulates the heart rate. These studies have become part of the mainstream of cardiac physiology and have been extensively utilised by the pharmaceutical industry in the design of drugs to increase cardiac output and to ameliorate the effects of ischaemia. In parallel studies of skeletal muscle, Allen established that muscle fatigue is primarily caused by failure of intracellular calcium release and the work has contributed to the demise of the lactic acid theory of fatigue. Most recently Allen has discovered that the muscle damage is a consequence of calcium entry through a stretch-activated channel. In a major development with possible therapeutic implications, he has shown that this channel is also important in muscular dystrophy and drugs that block this channel are able to reduce muscle damage.'

This led to the concept that in post-menopausal women oestrogen action in breast, brain and bone is due to local production in these respective sites. This new concept implies that unique modulation of synthesis in a tissue-specific fashion is possible, leading to the development of breast-specific inhibitors of aromatase expression, and thereby preventing the development of breast tumours.'

S'Professor Stanley is a world leader in perinatal epidemiology. She pioneered linking obstetric and child health records to measure disease burden and study causal pathways. Her demonstration of protection against neural tube defects by dietary folate in pregnancy depended on them. She has used them to study the causes of cerebral palsies and showed, contrary to opinions of the day, that pathways via birth asphyxia were rare and that most cerebral palsy has its origin early in gestation. Her studies of pre-term birth and low birth weight have shown important inter-generational effects and led to new ways of thinking about and analysing cause in epidemiology.'

S'Dr Jacobsen is internationally renowned for his contributions to plant science in the field of hormonal action in plant cells. In his analysis of the a-amylase gene in barley aleurone cells, he showed that gibberellin action involved new protein and mRNA synthesis. At the gene level, he identified elements in the a-amylase promoter which mediate gibberellin control. He identified a transcription factor, GAMYB, which binds to the a-amylase promoter to control transcription. This protein/DNA interaction is a major component of the gibberellin signal transduction pathway. Jacobsen has applied this knowledge to genetically engineer barley to improve malting quality.'

S'Professor Esler developed a unique radiotracer method for the neurochemical study of the sympathetic nervous system in humans. Esler\'s noradrenaline "spillover" method allows quantification of sympathetic function over time and in comparisons between individuals, and has been widely adopted internationally, as illustrated by its use in the April 1998 studies of neural circulatory control on board Space Shuttle Columbia. The method has allowed Esler to show that enhanced sympathetic activity is probably the major mechanism initiating high blood pressure; regulation involves the CNS noradrenergic neurons, which determine the \'defence\' pattern of sympathetic activity in response to longterm stress. The other major discovery has been in connection with heart failure, where results obtained were pivotal to the understanding of the neural pathophysiology of heart failure, providing the theoretical basis for the recent successful use of \xc3\x9f-adrenergic blockers in this condition.'

S'Professor Flambaum produced important results in the area of violation of fundamental symmetries. With his co-workers, these results included the prediction of a 10"6 fold enhancement of parity violation in neutronnucleus reactions which opened a new area of research; the first calculation of the nuclear anapole moment and the suggestion of atomic experiments which lead to measurement of this moment in 1997. Also provided were the most accurate calculations of parity violation in atoms. His Australian works include predictions of collective effects of time invariance violation in nuclei, quantum chaos in complex atoms, and a new statistical theory of finite Fermi systems based on the properties of chaotic eigenstates.'

This profound discovery was a remarkable fulfilment of Koch's postulates, based on astute clinical and laboratory observations combined with a dramatic self-infection experiment showing conclusively that cultured bacteria induced gastritis. Marshall characterised the ulcerogenic bacterium as a new species Helicobacter Pylori established growth dependence on urea and developed diagnostic tests for its presence and eradication. His observations are a major contribution to microbiology, have revolutionised treatment of gastroduodenal ulcers, by enabling cure with antibiotics, and will substantially reduce the prevalence of gastric cancer."

S'Ian Reay Mackay is distinguished for contributions to clinical immunology, particularly autoimmune disease. Mackay wrote the first text (1963), with F. M. Burnet, on the nature of autoimmune disease. He identified autoimmunity as one cause of chronic hepatitis (1956) and established diagnostic serological assays, and showed that corticosteroid and immunosuppressive drugs reversed autoimmune inflammation in the liver (1957-1968). Mackay also described primary biliary cirrhosis as an autoimmune disease (1958) and his laboratory identified the autoantigenic mitochondrial polypeptides (1985) and the nuclear gene coding for the major polypeptide (1987), now recognized as part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. His discoveries provided important insights into liver disease and autoimmunity in general.\xc2\xa0'

His work has established that the movement of the membrane can account fully for the frequency tuning of auditory nerve fibres, and that the ability of the membrane to move in this tuned fashion is dependent on cells of the organ of Corti. Together these findings led Johnstone to propose and then demonstrate that the outer hair cells are actively motile cells, driving the movements of the membrane. This revolutionary idea synthesised many puzzling phenomena of the auditory system; explains the previously puzzling deafness of age as a failure of the outer hair cells; and has begun a search for the molecular mechanisms responsible for the very high rates of contraction attained by motile hair cells."

S"McCloskey has made major contributions in two fields: the protective and regulatory functions of arterial chemoreceptors in influencing breathing and the circulation; and the relative roles of different skeletomuscular sense organs in awareness of limb position and movement, and in the sense of effort in voluntary actions. In both these series of researches, he has shown outstanding originality, ingenuity and experimental skill and has achieved substantial advances not only in basic understanding, but in providing a practical basis for management of disorders, such as dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. McCloskey's research is internationally recognised as outstanding. His claim to the Fellowship rests not only on the importance of his discoveries, but especially on the originality, creativity and elegant simplicity of the experimental approaches he has devised.\xc2\xa0"

For a period of 30-35 years very little development occurred in the theory of minimal surfaces; it was generally considered that the outstanding problems were too difficult to be dealt with by existing mathematical theories. During the 1960's, a new mathematical theory - called geometric measure theory - was introduced and developed by Fleming and Federer and it showed promise as a new tool for dealing with minimal surfaces. During the 1970's, ways were found by Simon, Almgren and others for applying the new geometric measure theory to minimal surfaces and many new results were obtained.

It has been said of his problem "... the combination of overall molecular complexity, centers of high sensitivity towards many reagents, and a singularly diabolical placement and density of functionality serves to thwart all but the most sophisticated of approaches" (E. J. Corey). His syntheses are based on innovative strategies of wide importance for C-C bond formations in new ways, particularly from aromatic starting materials. The approach is to reduce the planning and execution of organic synthesis to a set of reliable procedures. A successful objective of the gibberellin work is to illuminate relations between structure and biological activity, using structurally modified analogues, and to provide specific isotope labelled compounds as probes for biological investigation.\xc2\xa0'

Applying his background in mathematics and electrical engineering, he solved the equations describing spread of excitatory current in complex nerve and muscle cells, and developed new procedures for analysing their passive electrical properties, including those of the geometrically highly complex spinal motoneurone. By recording responses of one motoneurone to impulses in a single presynaptic nerve fibre, both subsequently labelled and visualized histochemically, he has succeeded in relating the precise location and number of the endings of a single presynaptic fibre to the quantitatively analysed excitatory action of single impulses therein. This unique achievement, together with his earlier mathematical modelling, is recognized internationally and qualifies Redman as a leading authority on excitatory synaptic transmission.\xc2\xa0'

Although he has shown the importance of cell-mediated immune responses in a number of systems, it is his work, during the last 8 years, on ectromelia infection of mice which represents his major contribution. This constitutes the most complete documentation of the role of cell\xc2\xadmediated immunity during infection by a natural pathogen. He was a pioneer in the development of a cytotoxic assay for the analysis of the kinetics and specificity of the T lymphocyte response during the course of the infection. With others, he was responsible for demonstrating that genes in the H-2K and H-2D regions of the major histocompatibility complex of the mouse determine whether or not interaction between effector cells and target cells can occur both in vitro and in vivo. These observations have opened up a new area of investigation in immunology. His use of H-2 mutant mice, in defining the specificity of the interaction, has been particularly elegant. In addition to his experimental findings he has also contributed significantly to theoretical considerations in cell-cell interactions in this system.\xc2\xa0'
