VLia Addadi\u2019s laboratory is interested in a wide range of questions related to the formation of crystals and other aggregated phases deposited in organisms, either fulfilling a physiological function, or pathologically induced. We study the interactions and cross talk between the crystals and the biological environment, spanning several orders of magnitude from the molecular level to the cell and tissue level. We aim at unraveling the strategies and design principles of the mineralized tissues, investigating them from their formation pathways (in foraminifera, sea urchin spicules and zebrafish bone) to the architecture (in dinoflagellates and mollusk shells) and finally to structure-function relations. We are currently particularly interested in how organisms manipulate light through complex crystalline architectures in plant leaves, in fish scales, crustacean cuticles and invertebrate eyes. Discovering similar pathways in widely different organisms raises fascinating questions about how common solutions have evolved. Relevant to atherosclerosis, we study how cholesterol crystals nucleate and grow from lipid bilayers and cell membranes, developing into atherosclerotic plaques. Relevant to osteoporosis, we investigate how osteoclasts recognize, adhere to and resorb bone.Lia Addadi\u2019s laboratory is interested in a wide range of questions related to the formation of crystals and other aggregated phases deposited in organisms, either fulfilling a physiological function, or pathologically induced.

VAeppli\u2019s scientific research is currently focused on the applications of nanotechnology and photon science to biomedicine and quantum information processing. Projects include the development of optical and microwave tools for medical diagnostics and pharmacology, where we are interested in new drug-target and antibody-antigen binding assays. We pay particular attention to obtaining specific, quantitative results, as well as to ease of use and (eventual) low cost for our engineered systems. Photons are also at the heart of efforts to control and read out quantum states in solids, including especially silicon, for which we exploit coherent, tunable pulses of THz radiation from a free electron laser. Our most recent work (2015) describes the electrical detection of coherent orbital superpositions in a commercial silicon wafer. A related topic is adiabatic quantum computing, where calculations are performed by mapping problems onto networks of bits, and then relaxing the networks via quantum mechanics. This procedure is most easily modeled in the limits of very large networks using magnets (although programmable medium size networks containing of order 1000 bits are now being implemented using superconducting junctions), where the bits correspond to Ising spins with either up or down magnetization, and quantum mechanics is introduced via a \u201ctransverse\u201d field, which allows tunneling between the up and down states.Aeppli\u2019s scientific research is currently focused on the applications of nanotechnology and photon science to biomedicine and quantum information processing.

VAgol's research focusses on 3-dimensional topology, principally the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. One main theme is the interaction of topology and geometry, and the study of 2-dimensional surfaces sitting in 3-dimensional spaces. He resolved the tameness conjecture of Marden (and by implication the Ahlfors measure conjecture), which was independently resolved by Danny Calegari and David Gabai. In 2012, he announced the solution of the virtual Haken and virtual fibering conjectures (partly in joint work with Daniel Groves and Jason Manning). The resolution of these conjectures followed from a conjecture of Dani Wise in geometric group theory regarding cube complexes and word-hyperbolic groups (in the sense of Mikhail Gromov), and made extensive use of the techniques of Wise and his collaborators.Agol's research focusses on 3-dimensional topology, principally the study of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

VManindra Agrawal started his research by investigating the structure of NP-complete sets, particularly the Isomorphism Conjecture which states that all NP-complete sets are isomorphic to each other under polynomial time computable isomorphisms. After a series of papers on this problem, he proved the conjecture for an interesting subclass of NP-complete problems: sets complete under reductions computable by constant depth circuits. His interest then moved on to computational number theory and algebra where he initiated a new approach for primality testing which culminated in the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the problem. In the last decade or so, he has worked primarily on Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem: to check if a polynomial, given as a sequence of addition and multiplication operations, is non-zero. He has contributed to showing the fundamental importance of this problem to the quest of finding an explicit polynomial that requires exponential number of operations to compute. He has also been working on finding efficient algorithms for solving PIT.Manindra Agrawal started his research by investigating the structure of NP-complete sets, particularly the Isomorphism Conjecture which states that all NP-complete sets are isomorphic to each other under polynomial time computable isomorphisms.

VI am a neuroscientist who studies the brain biology of emotions. This involves uncovering genetic, molecular, and developmental mechanisms that control brain circuits that mediate both negative and positive affect. We have developed models in rodents to define the genetic and developmental bases of differences in temperament (inborn tendencies for anxiety vs. novelty seeking). We have defined the implications of these genetic differences in reacting to environmental conditions including responsiveness to stress and propensity for anxiety and addictive behaviors. This basic research complements our human work in the context of the Pritzker Research Consortium. In humans, we rely on genetic and genomic approaches to discover molecules that contribute to vulnerability to mood disorders-- Major Depression and Bipolar Illness. An example of this integrative approach is our discovery that the Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) family is highly altered in the brains of severely depressed individuals. Our follow-up animal studies show that FGFs, known to orchestrate brain development, also play a lifelong role in controlling mood and emotions. They are both genetic predisposing factors and mediators of environmental impact on emotionality. Altering them during early development or in adulthood has profound effects on anxiety, depression and substance abuse, and initiates the remodeling of brain circuits critical to these behaviors. FGF downstream mediators represent new targets for developing anti-anxiety and anti-depressant drugs.I am a neuroscientist who studies the brain biology of emotions.

VDr. Alitalo is best known for his work on oncogenes and mechanisms of angiogenesis. He discovered lymphangiogenesis its regulation by growth factors, receptors and signaling mechanisms. He has isolated and characterized several tyrosine kinases including the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase Tie1, which is related to the Tie2 receptor for angiopoietins and implicated in tumor angiogenesis. He cloned the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-3, purified and cloned its ligand VEGF-C, and showed that the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 pathway is required for angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. He was also central in the cloning and characterization of the VEGF-B. His laboratory is curerntly studying its function as a coronary vascular growth factor and metabolic regulator in the heart. Studies in his laboratory have demonstrated VEGF-C induced tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, intralymphatic tumor growth, and VEGF-C association with tumor metastasis and its inhibition by blocking the VEGFR-3 signal transduction pathway. The inhibitors of these pathways from his laboratory have now entered phase I clinical trials. He is also interested in molecular therapies for lymphedema, which are entering clinical trials. Recent work in his laboratory heve also led to studies of the homeobox transcription factor Prox1 in colon carcinoma stem cells and tumor progression.Dr. Alitalo is best known for his work on oncogenes and mechanisms of angiogenesis.

VSince joining IBM in 1957 with a Masters Degree in Mathematics, I have been working on the design and construction of compilers and programming languages for high performance computers. The goal is to bridge the gap between problem specifications and computer solutions so as to enable programmers and domain experts to be more productive and computer solutions to be faster and more precise. For more than 50 years advances in programming languages, software systems, computer designs and hardware components have enabled stunning advances in the problem-solving capabilities of high performance computing. However one of the main drivers of performance, the number of transistors/chip, hit a fundamental performance limit that was definitively identified in 2003. So how to continue achieving hardware-driven performance advances? The answer: multicores. These simpler, more flexible, hardware building blocks can be linked in multiple ways and performance achieved by parallelism. But how are problems specified so the performance potential of parallelism is utilized? The task of bridging this gap is considered the biggest problem Computer Science has ever faced! I agree. Having led a successful research project on automatic parallelization of programs, I am now giving lectures on the problem and possible solutions.Since joining IBM in 1957 with a Masters Degree in Mathematics, I have been working on the design and construction of compilers and programming languages for high performance computers.

VAs a geneticist and cell biologist I study the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis and the consequences of their failure on cell physiology. We use the budding yeast S. cerevisiae to study the final stages of mitosis and showed that this cell cycle transition is controlled by the protein phosphatase Cdc14. Our studies on the regulation of Cdc14 activity have served as a paradigm for how the activity of a protein is regulated by its changes in subcellular localization. In our work on the meiotic divisions, we investigate how regulators of the mitotic cell cycle are employed during meiosis to bring about the specialized meiotic cell cycle program.As a geneticist and cell biologist I study the molecular mechanisms of chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis and the consequences of their failure on cell physiology.

An and his group pioneered Chinese loess and environment studies in the 1980s. Around 1990 An proposed the \u201cpaleomonsoon control theory\u201d which hypothesized that East Asian environmental changes since the late Cenozoic were largely controlled by monsoon variations. An also pioneered the identification of proxies to determine the history, variability, and driving forcings of the East Asian monsoon within a global context. He has extended this exploration to the dynamics of the Indian monsoon, as well as studies of monsoon variability at global scale, by integrating the data of monsoons and paleomonsoons, and helping the understanding of the science of monsoon systems for a range of timescales. He has also carried out sustantial research on the sustainable development of the Loess Plateau and western China, and on urban air pollution control.

VI have applied bacteriology and simple chemistry to development of vaccines against bacterial infections of infancy, particularly bacteria in which the capsular polysaccharide (CP) interferes with phagocytic clearance. Antibody to CP is protective, but the immune response to CP matures slowly. Along with other workers, I researched conjugation of CP to immunogenic carrier proteins, permitting early-life antibody induction. My approach was used for the first "conjugate" vaccines licensed for 2-month-old infants against meningitis and other life-threatening infections by haemophili, meningococci, and pneumococci. The substantial decline in Haemophilus disease prompted the 1996 Lasker Clinical Award and Pasteur Award to JB Robbins, R Schneerson, DH Smith, and me. Pneumococcus infections of infancy are prevalent and deadly in third-world settings, but conjugate vaccines are too expensive for nations most afflicted. Since 1996 I have worked with R Malley, reviving an inexpensive alternative consisting of killed bacteria--technology readily transferable to developing-world manufacturers. This was protective in preclinical testing, partly through an unexpected antibody-independent, CD4+ T lymphocyte-dependent mechanism, mediated through pro-phagocytic activity of the cytokine IL17A and attributable to TLR agonists within the vaccine. Approval for clinical testing is being sought.I have applied bacteriology and simple chemistry to development of vaccines against bacterial infections of infancy, particularly bacteria in which the capsular polysaccharide (CP) interferes with phagocytic clearance.

This was protective in preclinical testing, partly through an unexpected antibody-independent, CD4+ T lymphocyte-dependent mechanism, mediated through pro-phagocytic activity of the cytokine IL17A and attributable to TLR agonists within the vaccine. Approval for clinical testing is being sought.

VAndrei employs magneto-transport, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, to elucidate the electronic properties of graphene and other 2-dimensional materials, and how they are affected by external perturbations such as magnetic field, charge impurities, boundaries and substrate materials. For example she and her group demonstrated that by suspending graphene so as to leave it unattached to a substrate it is possible to access the intrinsic properties of its unusual charge carriers. This led to the observation of the so called "fractional quantum Hall effect", providing a direct manifestation of unexpectedly strong electron- electron correlations in this material. In 2009, the AAAS journal Science cited these findings in its list of the year's 10 groundbreaking scientific achievements. Another example is the discovery by Andrei and her group of so-called "Van Hove singularities" in the band structure of stacked graphene layers. They showed that by superposing graphene layers so that their relative crystal orientation is twisted away from equilibrium it is possible to change in a controlled way the band structure, a property which is usually considered to be intrinsic to the chemical composition and crystal structure of a material.Andrei employs magneto-transport, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, to elucidate the electronic properties of graphene and other 2-dimensional materials, and how they are affected by external perturbations such as magnetic field, charge impurities, boundaries and substrate materials.

VNancy Andrews\u2019 laboratory is interested in mammalian iron homeostasis and its disruption in human diseases. Through positional cloning of the affected genes in classical rodent mutants with anemia, her group identified the first mammalian transmembrane iron transporter and demonstrated its importance in intestinal iron absorption and red blood cell differentiation. They characterized a second transmembrane iron transporter that releases iron from cells and showed that insufficiency of a peptide that regulates that transporter is fundamentally important in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder. They proposed that diminished cellular iron export plays a major role in the anemia of inflammation and, with others, confirmed that hypothesis. Starting with a patient that Andrews treated, her group identified the gene responsible for a disorder that they named iron-refractory iron deficiency (IRIDA). Recently, the Andrews lab has determined new roles for the classical transferrin receptor, suggesting that iron and the transferrin receptor may have relevance to a variety of diseases that have not generally been considered iron disorders.Nancy Andrews\u2019 laboratory is interested in mammalian iron homeostasis and its disruption in human diseases.

She and her colleagues investigate how multisensory information flows between subcortical and cortical brain areas and how internal states modulate this information flow. They use innovative approaches to explore and understand neural dynamics and network coding of multi-sensory and multi-modal information at multiple stages of processing under diverse naturalistic and perceptual contexts related to navigation, planning and perceptual decisions. They are interested in the neural implementation of canonical neural computations and how they go astray to result in sensory, motor, memory and cognitive deficits in diseases like autism and schizophrenia. Their goal is to use this knowledge to understand computational principles of disease, to inspire artificial systems, to aid the development of tools for understanding and treating deficits of sensory coding, spatial orientation, cognition and action.Dora Angelaki specializes in the neural mechanisms of spatial perception and spatial navigation, and how they impact complex cognitive behavior.

VA major focus of research in the Anseth group is the development of biomaterial scaffolds with highly-controlled architectures and chemistries for three-dimensional cell culture, tissue regeneration, and biological arrays and/or assays. We are particularly interested in understanding how cells receive information from materials and what happens to cell function over time when assembled within three-dimensional microenvironments. Our approach exploits classical engineering principles and modeling, as control is required on many times scales, from seconds to months, and on many size scales, from the molecular to macroscopic. Our methods include the design of passive biomaterial niches that simply permit cells to function, as well as bioactive environments that dynamically promote or suppress specific cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production. Our research spans the spectrum of fundamental studies to better understand the role of the biomaterial environment on cell function and the biology of tissue formation to targeted clinical applications in the design of in situ forming cell carriers that promote healing. Further, we use these materials to develop innovative techniques to characterize and screen cell-material interactions, rapidly detect biological molecules through controlled surface chemistries, and develop models to study cellular pathology.A major focus of research in the Anseth group is the development of biomaterial scaffolds with highly-controlled architectures and chemistries for three-dimensional cell culture, tissue regeneration, and biological arrays and/or assays.

VMy work has been driven by two of the central mysteries in fundamental physics. (1) The union of quantum mechanics and gravity suggests that the notion of spacetime is approximate and must be replaced by more primitive principles, and there are related indications of fundamental limitations to quantum mechanics in both the early and late universe. These clues hint that both space-time and quantum mechanics will come to be thought of as emerging from more basic physical and mathematical ideas. I have been studying these issues in the context of scattering amplitudes ingauge theories and gravity, which give a theoretical playground where aspects of these questions can be sharply posed, while connecting directly to the experimental program of collider physics. (2) Meanwhile, we do not have a good answer to an incredibly simple question: why is the universe big, with big things in it? Indeed the existence of our macroscopic universe appears to be wildly incompatible with increasingly violent quantum fluctuations at short distances. Long-held theoretical prejudices centered about this mystery have been shattered by the two great experimental discoveriesof the accelerating universe, and a Higgs particle unaccompanied by other new physics at the Large Hadron Collider. Over ten years ago I pursued a different approach to these problems that amongst other things (successfully) predicted the mass of the Higgs particle to lie in a narrow range, and I continue to pursue this and other new approaches to the deceptively simple question \u2013 \u201cWhy is there a macroscopic universe?\u201d.My work has been driven by two of the central mysteries in fundamental physics.

VJames Arthur works in the area of mathematics called automorphic representations. These objects date back to the nineteenth century, but in recent years have come to occupy a central place in mathematics known as the Langlands program. The conjectures of Robert Langlands that define the program are still largely unresolved. Roughly speaking, they assert that concrete spectral data wrapped up in automorphic representations govern fundamental processes from quite different domains of mathematics. One of the primary tools for analyzing automorphic representations has been a complex trace formula that relates this spectral data to various kinds of geometric data. It was introduced in special cases by Selberg in 1956, and was then established for general groups by Arthur over the later period from 1975 to 2000. Arthur has used the trace formula to classify certain automorphic representations and establish some cases of the Langlands conjectures. He is now working on the central premise of the Langlands program known as the principle of functoriality.James Arthur works in the area of mathematics called automorphic representations.

VAshtekar\u2019s group developed the theory of quantum Riemannian geometry that lies at the foundation of Loop Quantum Gravity. It describes 'atoms of geometry'. Space-time can be visualized as a fabric that is woven by one-dimensional quantum threads. Thanks to this specific microscopic description, the big bang of general relativity is tamed and replaced by a big bounce. Consequently, there are no infinities and one can study the very early universe unambiguously. This theory has been developed in detail, shown to make predictions that are borne out by the cosmic microwave background missions, and has also made predictions for future observations. It brings out an unforeseen relation between the very small and the very large. Ashtekar and his team have also analyzed global problems in general relativity. They developed the notion of quasi-local horizons that is widely used in numerical simulations of black hole collisions, as well as in the investigations of the quantum mechanical evaporation of black holes. On another front, they have shown that the presence of a cosmological constant introduces unforeseen issues in the theory of gravitational waves and constructed a framework to address them. In broad terms, these diverse projects explore the interface of physics and geometry.Ashtekar\u2019s group developed the theory of quantum Riemannian geometry that lies at the foundation of Loop Quantum Gravity.

VAslin uses a variety of techniques to study how young infants, children, and adults learn from structured stimulus materials created in the lab to control for many extraneous variables that are present in naturally occurring stimuli.  His research on implicit mechanisms of learning, devoid of reinforcement or feedback, established a general approach that has been called statistical learning because it entails sensitivity to the distributional properties of perceptual input.  Using eye-trackers to study how attention is allocated to visual and auditory input, Aslin has documented the remarkably ability of infants to learn the underlying structure of information, to anticipate upcoming information, and to combine difference sources of information.  He has also used neuroimaging techniques to reveal which areas of the infant and adult brain are activated during statistical learning.  His studies of language processing in infants, children, and adults have revealed remarkably sophisticated abilities to discriminate speech sounds, adapt to new speech categories, segment words from fluent speech, recognize the meanings of words, and form grammatical categories.  His studies of visual learning have uncovered powerful mechanisms for extracting new features that are combined to form a hierarchy of representations for both familiar and novel objects and scenes.Aslin uses a variety of techniques to study how young infants, children, and adults learn from structured stimulus materials created in the lab to control for many extraneous variables that are present in naturally occurring stimuli.  His research on implicit mechanisms of learning, devoid of reinforcement or feedback, established a general approach that has been called statistical learning because it entails sensitivity to the distributional properties of perceptual input.  Using eye-trackers to study how attention is allocated to visual and auditory input, Aslin has documented the remarkably ability of infants to learn the underlying structure of information, to anticipate upcoming information, and to combine difference sources of information.  He has also used neuroimaging techniques to reveal which areas of the infant and adult brain are activated during statistical learning.  His studies of language processing in infants, children, and adults have revealed remarkably sophisticated abilities to discriminate speech sounds, adapt to new speech categories, segment words from fluent speech, recognize the meanings of words, and form grammatical categories.  His studies of visual learning have uncovered powerful mechanisms for extracting new features that are combined to form a hierarchy of representations for both familiar and novel objects and scenes.Aslin uses a variety of techniques to study how young infants, children, and adults learn from structured stimulus materials created in the lab to control for many extraneous variables that are present in naturally occurring stimuli.  His research on implicit mechanisms of learning, devoid of reinforcement or feedback, established a general approach that has been called statistical learning because it entails sensitivity to the distributional properties of perceptual input.  Using eye-trackers to study how attention is allocated to visual and auditory input, Aslin has documented the remarkably ability of infants to learn the underlying structure of information, to anticipate upcoming information, and to combine difference sources of information.  He has also used neuroimaging techniques to reveal which areas of the infant and adult brain are activated during statistical learning.  His studies of language processing in infants, children, and adults have revealed remarkably sophisticated abilities to discriminate speech sounds, adapt to new speech categories, segment words from fluent speech, recognize the meanings of words, and form grammatical categories.  His studies of visual learning have uncovered powerful mechanisms for extracting new features that are combined to form a hierarchy of representations for both familiar and novel objects and scenes.

VPhaedon Avouris\u2019 research interests involve primarily the understanding of the relation between electronic structure and the electrical and photonic properties of carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and graphene and their possible use in novel electronic and photonics technologies. The work involves experiments and theoretical modeling, as well as the fabrication and study of model devices. This work led to the first carbon nanotube field effect transistors, logic gates, integrated electronic circuits and photon detectors. Similar results were achieved based on graphene, including the development of GHz high frequency transistors, integrated circuits, infrared detectors and plasmonic devices. Earlier work focused on the behavior of molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Avouris used scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) to image on the atomic scale how chemical reactions take place at metal and semiconductor surfaces and study the factors that determine the reactivity of surface sites. He also used the STM to manipulate individual atoms and molecules at surfaces.Phaedon Avouris\u2019 research interests involve primarily the understanding of the relation between electronic structure and the electrical and photonic properties of carbon nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes and graphene and their possible use in novel electronic and photonics technologies.

VBailey-Serres is interested in genetic mechanisms that underlie the ability of plants to thrive in frequently challenging environments. Her research ranges from the study of individual genes and their function to processes of signal transduction and gene network regulation, critical for strategies that enable survival under extreme unfavorable conditions, particularly floods and droughts. A key interest is in understanding how plant cells perceive, transduce, and ultimately respond to oxygen deprivation and re-oxygenation, whether a consequence of environmental or developmental factors. In her research, natural genetic variation and functional genomics are paired to explore plasticity in metabolism and development that enable successful growth under stress and recovery conditions in crops and model species. The research integrates studies of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation with an emphasis on mRNA turnover, sequestration and translation in specific organs and individual cell-types. The overall goal of these investigations is to identify and understand mechanisms that enable sustained crop production despite extremes in water availability, thereby alleviating pressures caused by climate change and enhancing global food security.Bailey-Serres is interested in genetic mechanisms that underlie the ability of plants to thrive in frequently challenging environments.

In the physical domain, they have shown that a persistence principle enables infants to realize, from a very early age, that objects continue to exist when hidden. Infants\u2019 skeletal framework also guides their acquisition of physical knowledge, via an explanation-based learning process: Infants learn about simple events by identifying the features that are causally relevant for predicting how the events will unfold. In the psychological domain, Baillargeon\u2019s laboratory has shown that infants are capable of attributing to agents sophisticated mental states such as false beliefs and deceptive intentions to implant false beliefs. Infants then use these mental states, together with a principle of rationality, to predict agents\u2019 actions. In the biological domain, their research has shown that infants identify novel self-propelled and agentive entities as animals and, in accordance with an \u201cinnards\u201d principle, expect them to have filled insides.

VSteven Balbus\u2019s research interests span a broad range of topics in theoretical astrophysics. Early work included investigations of heating and cooling processes in the interstellar medium and gasdynamical processes in spiral galaxies. Since the early 1990\u2019s Balbus has been studying turbulence in accretion disks in many different astrophysical environments. How the Keplerian gas flow in such disks degenerates into turbulence, as observations strongly imply, had been a major problem in astrophysics. In a series of papers starting in 1991, Balbus and J. Hawley showed that the presence of any weak magnetic field in a rotating gas leads to a rapid instability, if the rotation rate of the gas decreases radially outwards. This is a much less stringent requirement than the classical Rayleigh criterion that the specific angular momentum decrease outwards. Subsequent computer simulations revealed the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, and the field of numerical accretion disk studies began. Balbus developed these ideas further, showing how weak magnetic fields profoundly affect the stability of dilute plasmas yet more generally. He has made important contributions to the theory of the Sun\u2019s internal rotation, and has recently ventured into a very different field: how palaeozoic ocean tides may have influenced vertebrate evolution.Steven Balbus\u2019s research interests span a broad range of topics in theoretical astrophysics.

Balbus is a native of Philadelphia, PA. He took undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and completed a PhD in theoretical astrophysics at UC Berkeley in 1981. After postdoctoral positions at MIT and Princeton, Balbus joined the faculty of the University of Virginia in 1985. He moved to the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris in 2004, where he was Professor of Physics, Classe exceptionnelle and was awarded a Chaire d\u2019excellence for his research on accretion disks.

VBaldwin is distinguished by having integrated the advances in molecular biology into the study of ecological interactions to catalyze a change in how ecologists examine ecological interactions and falsify hypotheses and by having integrated the whole-organismic expertise of ecologists into the study of gene function. In this research program, Baldwin and colleagues regularly use a nature preserve in the Great Basin Desert to conduct experiments with genetically modified Nicotiana attenuata plants in the plant's native environment to understand the genes that matter for survival in the rough and tumble of nature. The genetic transformations, and the molecular biological and chemical characterizations of the plants occurs at the Max-Planck Institute in Jena, while the field releases are conducted at the Lytle Ranch Preserve, which is owned and operated by the Brigham Young University. The research program has uncovered how plants resist (via direct and direct defenses), tolerate (by changing source-sink relationships) and escape (by changing pollinator systems) attack from herbivores, responses which are all elicited by the plant's perception of insect-specific elicitors introduced into wounds while feeding, in addition to how plants optimize pollination services, establish opportunistic mutualisms with soil bacteria and use their circadian clock to anticipate important ecological events.Baldwin is distinguished by having integrated the advances in molecular biology into the study of ecological interactions to catalyze a change in how ecologists examine ecological interactions and falsify hypotheses and by having integrated the whole-organismic expertise of ecologists into the study of gene function.

VIan Baldwin's interests in biology, chemistry and molecular biology were nucleated by inspiring mentors at the Boy's Latin School (Frank Collins), Dartmouth College (Jack Schultz), and Cornell University (Thomas Eisner, Jerrold Meinwald, Paul Feeny) and nurtured by many supportive colleagues during his pre- and post-tenure time at the State University of New York, Buffalo. In 1996, he was blessed with the opportunity to start the Max-Planck-Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany with 3 outstanding colleagues (Boland, Gershenzon and Mitchell-Olds), and in 2002, with colleagues from the Friedrich Schiller University, the International Max-Planck Research School. With dedicated colleagues in his Department of Molecular Ecology, he is training a new generation of whole-organismic biologists (genome-enabled field biologists) with 42 fledged doctoral students to date.  Many blue-collar jobs (as fish cleaner, logger, mechanic, truck driver) provided useful skills that provided balance to equally important cultural and analytical skills from an academic upbringing in Baltimore, by two medieval history professors, John Baldwin and Jenny Jochens. These skills are regularly refreshed during his annual stays at the field station.

VThe Baran laboratory is committed to identifying areas of chemical synthesis that can have a dramatic impact on the rate of drug discovery and development. This is achieved both through the development of practical total syntheses of complex natural products and by inventing reactions which can dramatically simplify retrosynthesis. Within the former area, the lab has advocated for and demonstrated how systematically aiming for \u201cideal\u201d synthesis pathways can dramatically simplify routes to a variety of molecules in alkaloid, terpene, and peptide classes. This has been accomplished through a systematic use of C\u2013H functionalization logic, deliberate avoidance of protecting groups, and strategic consideration of molecular redox states. In the latter area, focus has been on the invention of new tools (reagents and methods) that can be widely adopted by the largest body of practicing biomedical scientists, namely those in pharmaceutical industry. Of particular interest are methods for the construction of medicinally relevant C-C, C-O, C-N, C-B, and C-X bonds directly from minimally functionalized starting materials such as olefins, carboxylic acids, or simply exposed and innately reactive C\u2013H bonds.The Baran laboratory is committed to identifying areas of chemical synthesis that can have a dramatic impact on the rate of drug discovery and development.

VFor his research, Edouard Bard has used techniques of analytical chemistry to determine the extent and the timing of climatic variations. New quantitative methods have enabled him and his team to reconstruct past climates using varied archives such as oceanic sediments, lake sediments, corals, stalagmites and polar ice. His guiding principle has been the wish to study the same climatic phenomena, for example the glaciations, using complementary and often innovative geochemical techniques. In order to go back into the past, he has employed \u201ctime machines\u201d - i.e. complex mass spectrometers to measure radioactive isotopes and thus date the climatic variations imprinted in the various archives. Over the last thirty years, the main contributions by Edouard Bard are related to the following topics: diffusion in the ocean of carbon dioxide radiolabelled by thermonuclear radiocarbon measured by accelerator mass spectrometry, paleotemperature fluctuations of the surface ocean by means of isotopic proxies and biomarkers in marine sediments, sea level variations by applying the uranium-thorium mass spectrometry to date ancient coral reefs, past conditions at the ocean-atmosphere interface by using radiocarbon as a paleo-tracer, calibration of the radiocarbon dating method and use of other cosmogenic nuclides such as beryllium 10 to constrain past changes of the solar activity, geomagnetic field and the carbon cycle.For his research, Edouard Bard has used techniques of analytical chemistry to determine the extent and the timing of climatic variations.

He earned his master degree in 1985 from the geological engineering school at Nancy (ENSG) and his doctoral degree in 1987 from the University of Paris 11-Orsay. He conducted research in Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory as a postdoctoral fellow in 1988 and as an Associate Research Scientist in 1989. He then returned to France, joined first the Commissariat à l\u2019Energie Atomique (CEA), and then started teaching as a professor at the University of Aix-Marseille in 1991 and at the Collège de France since 2001. His various studies are at the interface of climatology, oceanography and geology. The essential objective is to understand the natural functioning of the ocean-atmosphere system on time scales ranging from a few decades to several million years. Indeed, the variations of the climate involve mechanisms with very different time-constants. It is thus necessary to have a long-term perspective in order to distinguish the respective impacts of geological, astronomical and anthropogenic forcings.Edouard Bard has the Professor Chair in Climate and Ocean Evolution at the Collège de France and his laboratory is located in Aix-en-Provence.

VBonnie Bartel\u2019s research group has contributed to understanding of auxin metabolism and microRNA functions and currently investigates the biogenesis, functions, and degradation of peroxisomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. The growth hormone auxin controls virtually all facets of plant development. Bartel\u2019s laboratory identified enzymes releasing auxin from precursors, discovered compartmentalization of auxin production in the endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, and revealed the importance of different auxin sources during seedling development. Their discovery of a peroxisome-based pathway of auxin biosynthesis led her to explore the biogenesis, functions, and dynamics of this vital organelle. Peroxisomes compartmentalize critical metabolic reactions, thereby protecting the cytosol from oxidative damage. Through isolating and characterizing a suite of peroxisome-defective Arabidopsis mutants, Bartel\u2019s group has discovered organelle import factors, essential interdependencies among biogenesis components, and degradative pathways that control organelle remodeling.Bonnie Bartel\u2019s research group has contributed to understanding of auxin metabolism and microRNA functions and currently investigates the biogenesis, functions, and degradation of peroxisomes in Arabidopsis thaliana.

VMy lab studies RNAs that regulate gene expression in animals, plants and yeast. We were among those to find that animals have many microRNAs, which are ~22-nt RNAs that specify gene repression by base-pairing to messages of protein-coding genes. We then found miRNAs in plants and have been developing increasingly reliable methods for identifying the regulatory targets of microRNAs in both plants and animals. Using these methods, we uncovered the widespread scope of microRNA-mediated regulation in animals, providing compelling evidence that most human genes are regulated by microRNAs. Our genome-wide approaches are also showing that miRNAs primarily act to decrease target mRNA levels, and experiments following-up on individual targeting interactions are revealing biological functions of microRNA action, such as how microRNAs play critical roles in plant development and how the interaction between a human microRNA and one of its regulatory targets helps prevent human cancers.My lab studies RNAs that regulate gene expression in animals, plants and yeast.

VResearch in the Bass laboratory is focused on understanding the biological functions of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsRNA binding proteins (dsRBPs). Viruses were once thought to be the sole source of long dsRNA, but the Bass laboratory has identified numerous long dsRNAs that naturally exist in animals, primarily focusing on C. elegans and mammals. Proteins that recognize dsRNA are not sequence-specific, and the Bass laboratory is interested in how these proteins distinguish endogenous and viral dsRNA, as well as how endogenous dsRNA-mediated pathways coexist. Their studies indicate dsRNA-mediated pathways intersect and compete for dsRNA substrates. For example, altered levels of the dsRBP ADAR, an RNA editing enzyme, or altered levels of dsRNA, alters the levels of the small RNAs produced by the dsRBP Dicer. In addition to molecular biology, bioinformatics, and in vivo studies in C. elegans and mammalian cells, the Bass laboratory relies on biochemistry studies for insight. Biochemical studies of Dicer revealed that the ends, or termini, of dsRNA are important for its recognition, possibly providing a way to distinguish viral and cellular dsRNA. Biochemical and structural studies of ADAR revealed inositol hexakisphosphate as an essential cofactor.Research in the Bass laboratory is focused on understanding the biological functions of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and dsRNA binding proteins (dsRBPs).

VBates explores a wide range topics associated with the structure and properties of polymers and related soft materials. The thermodynamics and phase behavior of block polymers, polymer blends and polymer solutions are addressed using light, x-ray and neutron scattering, and various real-space imaging techniques including electron microscopy. Melt state dynamics are probed with rheological tools while solid state properties including elasticity, ductility and fracture are explored by mechanical testing, often in conjuncture with scattering methods. Block polymers self-assemble into myriad ordered and disordered morphologies with nanoscale dimensions. The Bates group investigates how macromolecular architecture influences the formation of low symmetry periodic crystals and aperiodic quasicrystals using model block polymer compounds synthesized in his laboratory. Mixtures of block polymers and homopolymers result in the formation of a host of morphologies including bicontinuous microemulsions. Amphiphilic block polymers self-assemble into micelles and vesicles in solution, which have myriad applications including drug delivery and modification of cell membranes. His group pursues new avenues for making sustainable plastics and elastomers through the use of biologically sourced monomers and innovative approaches to recycling.

His laboratory has discovered new macromolecular complexes essential for protein folding and degradation and has contributed in a major way to our understanding of the structure and function of the proteasome. While using a broad array of methods ranging from genomics and proteomics to biochemistry and biophysics, electron microscopy plays a particularly important role in the repertoire of methods in the Baumeister laboratory. His group had, and continues to have, a pioneering role in the development of cryoelectron tomography which is now widely seen as a method of unique potential for visualizing macromolecular complexes in their functional cellular context (in situ structural biology). It holds great promise for bridging the divide that hitherto exists between molecular and cellular structural studies. Currently, the Baumeister laboratory develops correlative light microscopy - electron microscopy approaches as well as new micromachining tools for frozen hydrated samples enabling them to study complex cellular landscapes in unprecedented detail.Wolfgang Baumeister's research is focussed on the cellular pathways of protein quality control.

VSteve Baylin\u2019s laboratory group, for over 30 years has worked to define the origins and role of epigenetic abnormalities in tumorigenesis following their recognition of abnormal gene promoter DNA methylation in cancer in 1986. Their studies include discovering the involved genes and their pathway functions in tumor initiation and progression including Baylin serving as the Co-PI for the epigenetics group in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. From 2000 to 2010, his group identified epigenetically silenced genes co-operating with mutations to over-activate key oncogenic pathways such as the WNT pathway and defined that master regulators of embryonic development constitute the preponderance of genes undergoing promoter hyper-methylation in cancer. Most recently, they are uncovering a link, including recruitment of the protein complexes involved between stress-induced DNA damage integral to cancer risk states and triggering of the above hypermethylation in cancer. Baylin\u2019s team clinically translates their basic findings especially in the context of his role as a co-leader of a Stand Up to Cancer Team. These efforts encompass taking pre-clinically derived basic concepts directly to epigenetic therapy trials for patients and development of correlative biomarkers to predict and monitor therapeutic efficacies. The studies now emphasize that that DNA demethylating agents potentially enhance immune checkpoint therapy through upregulating endogenous retroviral transcripts, triggering an interferon inducing pathway involved with sensing cytoplasmic, dsRNA (\u201cviral mimicry\u201d). This concept now underlies multiple clinical trials aimed at use of epigenetic therapy to improve the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy for multiple common cancer types.Steve Baylin\u2019s laboratory group, for over 30 years has worked to define the origins and role of epigenetic abnormalities in tumorigenesis following their recognition of abnormal gene promoter DNA methylation in cancer in 1986.

VOur laboratory studies ion channels, the molecules underlying neuronal electrical excitability. Our main goal is to understand how the dozens of different types of ion channels expressed in mammalian neurons work together to produce the very different patterns of neuronal firing characteristic of different kinds of neurons. To do this, we use both brain slices and acutely dissociated neurons to record patterns of action potential firing and then use the voltage clamp technique to characterize the kinetics of the underlying ion channels, using pharmacological agents or genetically-modified animals to separate currents from distinct types of channels. We are particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms that underlie spontaneous firing of neurons in the absence of sensory or synaptic input. We are also interested in pathophysiological conditions that result in hyperexcitability of neurons, a phenomenon implicated in a number of diseases, including epilepsy, chronic pain, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We are attempting to develop new pharmacological agents to treat some of these conditions.Our laboratory studies ion channels, the molecules underlying neuronal electrical excitability.

VOur laboratory is studying the role of epigenetics and de novo and inherited mutations in human disease with particular emphasis on genomic imprinting and its role in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS), and autism. Genomic imprinting is the phenomenon of differential expression of the two alleles at an autosomal locus based on their parent of origin; usually one allele is expressed and the other silenced. PWS and AS are distinct human disorders characterized by neurobehavioral abnormalities and intellectual disability. They are caused by deficiency of paternally (PWS) or maternally (AS) expressed genes within chromosome 15q11-q13. Our laboratory has contributed to identification of molecular defects causing PWS and AS, identified the UBE3A locus encoding E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase as the AS gene, and made numerous mouse models related to PWS and AS. The molecular findings in PWS and AS and evidence that genomic imprinting of 15q11-q13 also plays a role in autism have led us to propose a mixed epigenetic and genetic and mixed de novo and inherited (MEGDI) model for oligogenic inheritance of autism. This proposes a radically different model with recent or new mutations in one or a few major genes causing autism in any one individual. This is in contrast to the widely held hypothesis that many genes with ancient mutations cause autism through a multilocus epistasis model. The lab is also focused on the use of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to detect novel mutations causing intellectual disability, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent results suggest that deletions of chromosome 15q13 cause a phenotype of intellectual disability, autism, schizophrenia, and aggressive behavior. This has led to detailed genotyping for the CHRNA7 gene which maps to 15q13.3 and encodes a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which we believe is important in genetic causes of neurobehavioral disorders. Very recently, we discovered a novel inborn error of carnitine biosynthesis caused by deficiency of the X-linked TMLHE gene. This deficiency is present in 1 in 350 control males and is a risk factor for autism. This has led us to hypothesize that neuronal carnitine deficiency may play a broader role in non-dysmorphic autism, and that some forms of autism may be preventable or treatable through dietary supplementation with carnitineOur laboratory is studying the role of epigenetics and de novo and inherited mutations in human disease with particular emphasis on genomic imprinting and its role in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS), and autism.

VMarlene Behrmann's laboratory is interested in the psychological and neural mechanisms that underlie visual processing. Despite the paucity of input from the retina (roughly amount and wave length of light), humans can recognize visual scenes and their content with remarkable ease, speed and accuracy. To elucidate the mechanisms by which this is achieved, Behrmann adopts a multiplicity of research methods including neuroimaging and electrophysiology, along with detailed psychophysics in normal and brain-damaged (stroke, trauma) individuals, as well as in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, face blindness).  For example, Behrmann\u2019s lab has characterized the neural circuit associated with face processing, as well as the structural connectivity between the nodes, and has elucidated the neural code associated with identifying individual faces. Behrmann and colleagues have also documented the interactivity between disparate parts of the visual system, namely the ventral temporal structures and the dorsal parietal structures, and its emergence over the course of development. In addition, Behrmann\u2019s lab has provided empirical support and a theoretical account, using computational approaches, for the processes that govern the organization of the two cerebral hemispheres in adult humans and the developmental trajectory by which this neural profile emerges.Marlene Behrmann's laboratory is interested in the psychological and neural mechanisms that underlie visual processing.

To elucidate the mechanisms by which this is achieved, Behrmann adopts a multiplicity of research methods including neuroimaging and electrophysiology, along with detailed psychophysics in normal and brain-damaged (stroke, trauma) individuals, as well as in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (autism, face blindness).  For example, Behrmann\u2019s lab has characterized the neural circuit associated with face processing, as well as the structural connectivity between the nodes, and has elucidated the neural code associated with identifying individual faces. Behrmann and colleagues have also documented the interactivity between disparate parts of the visual system, namely the ventral temporal structures and the dorsal parietal structures, and its emergence over the course of development. In addition, Behrmann\u2019s lab has provided empirical support and a theoretical account, using computational approaches, for the processes that govern the organization of the two cerebral hemispheres in adult humans and the developmental trajectory by which this neural profile emerges.

Bell discovered the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), the protein complex that identifies eukaryotic origins of replication and his lab has characterized the functions of this complex and used its genomic binding sites to identify origins of replication in multiple organisms. His lab pioneered methods to monitor association of replication proteins with the DNA in cells to identify components of the replication fork and the proteins involved in loading a key protein required for DNA replication, the replicative DNA helicase, at origins of replication. Their studies have contributed to understanding the mechanisms that ensure the genome is replicated only once per round of cell division.

VThe goal of my research program is to understand how organs develop. Most of our work uses the root of Arabidopsis as a tractable model system. We initially used molecular genetic approaches to identify a set of genes that are key regulators of the radial organization of the root. One of these regulators is a transcription factor that physically moves from its site of synthesis in the internal vascular tissue to its site of activity in the adjacent tissues. There it interacts with another transcription factor to turn on a suite of target genes including a component of the cell cycle machinery, which controls a critical asymmetric cell division. We have exploited the simple organization of the root to generate the most comprehensive genome-wide RNA expression map of an organ for any species. We have shown that the response to abiotic stresses is frequently highly cell-specific. Most recently, we identified a clock-like process that generates a wave of gene expression in the root tip and determines the competence to form branch roots.The goal of my research program is to understand how organs develop.

VI have had a longstanding love affair with plasma membranes, beginning with my PhD research with Pedro Cuatrecasas. Postdoctoral training with Dan Branton introduced me to the human erythrocyte as a window into the world's simplest and most accessible plasma membrane. My laboratory used the erythrocyte model to discover ankyrin and its role in connecting the anion exchanger to the spectrin skeleton. We subsequently found that ankyrins and spectrins are ubiquitously expressed. Our laboratory has characterized ankyrins -B and -G and resolved their role in organization of a surprisingly diverse set of proteins and membrane domains. Ankyrins and their partners play pervasive roles in vertebrate physiology including recent evolutionary adaptations such as fast signaling in the nervous system and heart. We have determined a simple "code" for ankyrin-binding by membrane proteins, that has been independently accessed by many protein families. We have found that ankyrin proteins are required for both localization of membrane partners as well as for formation of specialized membrane domains including axon initial segments of neurons and lateral membrane domains of epithelial cells. We currently are exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying ankyrin function as well as the pathological consequences such as cardiac arrhythmia and diabetes when these mechanisms fail.I have had a longstanding love affair with plasma membranes, beginning with my PhD research with Pedro Cuatrecasas.

VDuring development, all multicellular organisms face a similar set of challenges: they must create a diverse set of specialized cell types, organize these cells into functional tissues, and maintain pools of stem cells to replenish the tissues throughout their lifetimes. My group uses the development of plant stomata (the epidermal structures that regulate CO2 and water vapor exchange between the plant and atmosphere) as a model to understand how tissues integrate signals from a variety of sources into decisions about cell fate, cell signaling and cell polarity. By incorporating a variety of plants in our studies we found that a core set of conserved regulators underlie stomatal development, and that much of diversity in stomatal forms and patterns we see in nature stems from rewiring of interactions among these core regulators. Stomata also provide a framework to study the fundamental processes of plants at different organizational levels, from molecules and cells to whole plants and ecosystems. Collectively, the activities of billions of stomata on thousands of plant species contribute to global biosphere/atmosphere exchange. In collaboration with ecophysiologists, we have used tools derived from our molecular-scale studies to improve organismal-scale models for photosynthetic activity and provide experimental evidence that evolutionarily conserved stomatal patterns are essential for efficient photosynthesis.During development, all multicellular organisms face a similar set of challenges: they must create a diverse set of specialized cell types, organize these cells into functional tissues, and maintain pools of stem cells to replenish the tissues throughout their lifetimes. My group uses the development of plant stomata (the epidermal structures that regulate CO2 and water vapor exchange between the plant and atmosphere) as a model to understand how tissues integrate signals from a variety of sources into decisions about cell fate, cell signaling and cell polarity. By incorporating a variety of plants in our studies we found that a core set of conserved regulators underlie stomatal development, and that much of diversity in stomatal forms and patterns we see in nature stems from rewiring of interactions among these core regulators.

VMy laboratory is interested in defining the genetic aberrations that are critical for lung tumor development. Genetically engineered mouse models are used to unravel the specific mechanisms of action of the various lesions found in lung cancer in man. The tumor subtypes we are focusing on are: small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and mesothelioma. We induce tumor development by genetic activation of oncogenes and/or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The specific questions we try to answer: 1. What is the cell-of-origin of these tumors? Can different cell types in lung give rise to similar tumors? Do they retain specific features of their cell-of-origin? 2. Can we identify better intervention strategies? Do genetic screens in cell lines in vitro (transposon and Crisp/Cas9 mutagenesis) yield actionable targets that subsequently can be validated in autochthonous mouse models? 3. To what extent does the genetic background influence tumor development? Can we identify alleles of unaltered germline genes that synergize with oncogenic lesions in facilitating tumor development? 4. Do the observations made in the mouse models have a corollary in cognate human tumors and can this information be used for designing better intervention strategies?My laboratory is interested in defining the genetic aberrations that are critical for lung tumor development.

VBeverley's laboratory has focused on the introduction of modern concepts of microbial pathogenesis and molecular genetics into the study of protozoan parasites of humans, primarily the trypanosomatid Leishmania.  Studies of drug resistance, extra-chromosomal gene amplification and transcription led to the development of the first transfection system enabling both forward and reverse genetics, and have been widely adopted in the field.  Beverley's lab has put them to use in dissecting the role of major parasite surface glycoconjugates in parasite survival in both mammalian and insect hosts, immune recognition and evasion, identification of novel pathways of folate and pteridine metabolic amenable to chemotherapeutic attack, and the use of genetically modified parasites as safe live vaccine lines.  Modified parasites also provide therapeutic opportunities for use as live nanoplatforms for delivery of therapeutic proteins, an approach pursued by a company Beverley co-founded.  Leishmania genetic methods continue to evolve, including the use of imported mariner transposons, conditional gene expression, RNA interference, and genetic crossing (which occurs only in the sand fly vector).  Beverley spearheaded an NIHGRI/AID project for trypanosomatid genome sequencing which has led to comprehensive coverage of the genomes of diverse Leishmania species manifesting widely varying severity in humans, and key outgroups relevant to the origins of vertebrate parasitism.  Studies of RNA interference have led to the question of why most species of Leishmania have lost this vital pathway in evolution, and the potential role of transposable elements and RNA viruses.  Remarkably, the dsRNA virus LRV1 dramatically increases the severity of leishmaniasis, perhaps providing a driving force for RNAi loss, but also providing new opportunities for understanding parasite virulence and the role of 'endosymbiontic' viruses in biology and as potential targets for therapeutic interventions.Beverley's laboratory has focused on the introduction of modern concepts of microbial pathogenesis and molecular genetics into the study of protozoan parasites of humans, primarily the

VThe focus of Sangeeta Bhatia\u2019s research is on the development of novel micro- and nanoscale platforms for understanding, diagnosing, and treating human disease. While cell autonomous processes certainly influence the balance between health and disease, the laboratory\u2019s focus is on interactions between cells and their microenvironment. They leverage micro- and nanotechnology tools that have been created by the semiconductor community, which, by virtue of their spatial resolution, enable the precise synthesis, interrogation, and perturbation of tissue microenvironments. Specifically, they focus on tissue microenvironments of clinical importance in hepatology and oncology. In the area of hepatology, they are interested in liver tissue engineering - both for treating patients with cell-based therapies and for developing more predictive in vitro models of human disease. In the oncology field, they leverage the physical traits of nanomaterials to improve the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. The Bhatia group endeavors to translate their inventions and scientific findings to patients, and to advocate for diversity in science and engineering.The focus of Sangeeta Bhatia\u2019s research is on the development of novel micro- and nanoscale platforms for understanding, diagnosing, and treating human disease.

VBest known for contributions to our understanding of coding and computation in the brain, Bialek and collaborators have shown that aspects of brain function can be described as essentially optimal strategies for adapting to the complex dynamics of the world, making the most of the available signals in the face of fundamental physical constraints and limitations. He has followed these ideas of optimization into the early events of embryonic development, and the processes by which all cells make decisions about when to read out the information stored in their genes. In earlier work he explored the interface between quantum and classical dynamics in enzymes and in the initial events of photosynthesis. Recently he and his colleagues have shown how the collective states of biological systems -- the activity in a network of neurons, or the flight directions in a flock of birds -- can be described using ideas from statistical physics, connecting in quantitative detail with new experimental data. Most generally, he would like to know if there are theoretical principles that have the power and generality that we have come to expect in physics, yet encompass the full complexity and diversity of life's most beautiful phenomena.Best known for contributions to our understanding of coding and computation in the brain, Bialek and collaborators have shown that aspects of brain function can be described as essentially optimal strategies for adapting to the complex dynamics of the world, making the most of the available signals in the face of fundamental physical constraints and limitations.

VAdrian Bird has studied the biological and biomedical significance of DNA methylation. He introduced the use of restriction enzymes to map patterns of methylated CpG sites in genomic DNA. This led to the recognition that \u201cCpG islands\u201d - non-methylated CpG-rich genomic domains - are associated with the promoters of most mammalian genes and could be used as markers for early gene-discovery in mammalian DNA. The Bird laboratory later described a family of proteins with an affinity for the methyl-CpG sequence and demonstrated that several can mediate transcriptional repression. MeCP2 was the first methyl-CpG binding protein to be purified and was shown to recruit a transcriptional corepressor complex to DNA, providing a mechanistic connection between two different epigenetic marks \u2013 DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The report by others that mutations in the MECP2 gene cause of the autism spectrum disorder Rett Syndrome (RTT) led Bird to pursue the molecular basis of this disorder. His group created a convincing mouse model of RTT and established, unexpectedly, that the resulting severe neurological phenotype is reversible. Both terminally ill Mecp2-null males and chronically symptomatic heterozygous females lost all RTT-like signs, suggesting that this is potentially a curable disorder.Adrian Bird has studied the biological and biomedical significance of DNA methylation.

VThe fundamental questions we have addressed in my laboratory are: How tissue-specificity is maintained and how these processes go awry in cancer. Early work (70s) on Warburg effect indicated that it is the rate of glucose uptake that regulates rates of glycolysis in normal and transformed cells and that pattern of glucose metabolism was tissue-specific. Work in the 80s indicated that the context determines whether a potent oncogene is oncogenic or whether it could coexist within a normal host. Work in the 80s and 90s indicated that both malignant and normal cells are plastic and dependent on their microenvironment. We could "revert" malignant human breast cells in 3-dimensional extracellular-matrix (ECM) gels (an assay we developed in 1989 for mice mammary and in 1992 for human breast cells). Conversely we could make normal mice develop tumors by destroying the mammary structure by metalloproteinases in engineered mice. We thus established that: 1-ECM signals to tissue-specificity, 2-context matters, 3-phenotype is dominant over genotype, and 4- tissue structure is the ultimate regulator of tissue-specificity. Current work concentrates on the mechanism(s) of "dynamic reciprocity" (a model we proposed in 1982) between how the microenvironment signals and in return receives signals from the chromatin and the nucleus.The fundamental questions we have addressed in my laboratory are: How tissue-specificity is maintained and how these processes go awry in cancer.

VBlau's research challenged the long-held view that the differentiated state is fixed and irreversible by demonstrating that previously silent genes could be activated in human cells. Using a heterokaryon cell fusion system, her laboratory showed that the differentiated state requires continuous regulation and is controlled by the balance of regulators (transcription factors) present in a cell at any given time, principles fundamental to the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Her laboratory now capitalizes on the unique potential of the heterokaryon system to capture early and transient epigenetic and transcriptional events critical to reprogramming to pluripotency (iPS). Blau\u2019s laboratory has discovered that telomeres protect mice from cardiac diseases due to heritable defects in contractile proteins, such as dystrophin. The underlying mechanisms of telomere shortening and approaches to telomere elongation are a current major research focus. Blau\u2019s laboratory developed a means of manipulating the microenvironment by creating bioengineered niches to enhance muscle stem cell function. This platform has enabled the elucidation of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that diminish stem cell function with aging and muscular dystrophy. Her lab has discovered therapeutic strategies to rejuvenate the aged muscle stem cell population that enhance regeneration and restore strength to injured muscles in the elderly.Blau's research challenged the long-held view that the differentiated state is fixed and irreversible by demonstrating that previously silent genes could be activated in human cells.

Using a heterokaryon cell fusion system, her laboratory showed that the differentiated state requires continuous regulation and is controlled by the balance of regulators (transcription factors) present in a cell at any given time, principles fundamental to the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Her laboratory now capitalizes on the unique potential of the heterokaryon system to capture early and transient epigenetic and transcriptional events critical to reprogramming to pluripotency (iPS). Blau\u2019s laboratory has discovered that telomeres protect mice from cardiac diseases due to heritable defects in contractile proteins, such as dystrophin. The underlying mechanisms of telomere shortening and approaches to telomere elongation are a current major research focus. Blau\u2019s laboratory developed a means of manipulating the microenvironment by creating bioengineered niches to enhance muscle stem cell function. This platform has enabled the elucidation of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that diminish stem cell function with aging and muscular dystrophy. Her lab has discovered therapeutic strategies to rejuvenate the aged muscle stem cell population that enhance regeneration and restore strength to injured muscles in the elderly.

VJef Boeke elucidated one of the major forms of DNA movement (transposition) in yeast cells, in which Ty1 elements move via reverse transcription of RNA.  He coined the term retrotransposition to describe the process, which is common in virtually all eukaryotic genomes. His genetic and biochemical studies helped elucidate intricate molecular mechanisms involved in retrotransposition in yeasts, mammalian cells and mice. The Boeke laboratory has also constructed highly active synthetic retrotransposons as a probe of retrotransposition in cells and mice. Retrotransposition formed about half of all human DNA and has been a major force in genome evolution.  Another current interest is exploration of the frequency and impact of ongoing retrotransposition in the human germ line, somatic cells, and cancer.  In the area of Synthetic Biology, Jef Boeke is using yeast as a platform for exploring the construction of fully synthetic chromosomes for practical and theoretical studies.

VDale Boger is recognized for his work in organic synthesis, natural products total synthesis, synthetic methodology development, medicinal chemistry and has made seminal contributions to improving the glycopeptide antibiotics, to understanding the DNA-binding properties of naturally occurring antitumor-antibiotics, to probing protein-protein interactions, and to the discovery of new biological targets (e.g. FAAH). Most notable are his use of the hetero Diels-Alder reaction in syntheses of complex natural products, the development of cyclopropenone ketal cycloaddition reactions, the use of alkene addition reactions of acyl radicals, macrocyclization technology, an Fe(III)-mediated hydrogen atom transfer free radical functionalization of unactivated alkenes, and solution-phase combinatorial chemistry. Applications of this methodology in his natural products total syntheses are chosen based on their important biological properties. The most notable are CC-1065 and duocarmycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and vancomycin. They made the unusual observation that both enantiomers of CC-1065 and the duocarmycins constitute effective DNA alkylating agents, defined their DNA alkylation selectivity, identified a remarkable source of catalysis for the DNA alkylation reaction, defined structural features contributing to functional reactivity, and delineated their impact on biological properties. Similarly, his group was the first to extend their total synthesis of the glycopeptide antibiotics to redesigned vancomycins to address vancomycin resistance.Dale Boger is recognized for his work in organic synthesis, natural products total synthesis, synthetic methodology development, medicinal chemistry and has made seminal contributions to improving the glycopeptide antibiotics, to understanding the DNA-binding properties of naturally occurring antitumor-antibiotics, to probing protein-protein interactions, and to the discovery of new biological targets (e.g. FAAH).

VI have worked on diverse aspects of the ecology and evolution of plant life but the central theme is the exploration of the ecology, biogeography and evolution of open (shade-intolerant) ecosystems. I am intrigued by shrublands, grasslands and savannas growing in climates capable of supporting closed forests. Palaeoecological and phylogenetic studies have revealed surprisingly ancient origins for the biota that constitute open ecosystems, surprising because they are often assumed to be produced by felling and burning of forests by people. My colleagues and I have explored both physical and biotic controls on the distribution of these systems using a variety of tools, from remote sensing and physiologically-based global vegetation models, to field studies and glasshouse experiments. Fire, herbivory, soils, and atmospheric chemistry (especially changing CO2), interact within a climate setting to determine the proportions of open versus forested vegetation. Because they are only indirectly influenced by climate, these ecosystems may show rapid and unexpected responses to changing disturbance regimes or to CO2-induced changes in the ability of plants to respond to fire, herbivory, or drought.  Recognition of the large global extent of open ecosystems, and a greater appreciation of the sensitivity of the major growth forms to biotic and physical controls, has implications for land management and global change policy at local, regional and global scales.I have worked on diverse aspects of the ecology and evolution of plant life but the central theme is the exploration of the ecology, biogeography and evolution of open (shade-intolerant) ecosystems.

VDr. Boothroyd is fascinated by the interaction of an infectious agent and the host it infects. His entry into this field came with his joining a collaborative effort to understand antigenic variation in Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African Sleeping Sickness. His group went on to co-discover mRNA trans-splicing and polycistronic transcription in these single-celled eukaryotes. For about the past 25 years, he and his collaborators have been immersed in studying the pathogenesis of another single-celled eukaryote, Toxoplasma gondii. Unlike the African trypanosomes, this ubiquitous cousin of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, can only grow within another cell. His current work is focused on asking: (1) how Toxoplasma invades and co-opts almost any cell type from almost any warm-blooded animal; (2) how the parasite persists in the human host; 3) how it introduces a collection of polymorphic \u201ceffectors\u201d into a host cell; and 4) how these varied effectors produce different disease severity in the host, ranging from asymptomatic to fatal.Dr. Boothroyd is fascinated by the interaction of an infectious agent and the host it infects.

VSam Bowring is a geologist interested in using U-Pb geochronology to constrain the rates of geologic processes and to calibrate the timing of significant events in the geologic record.  His unwavering pursuit of the highest possible capabilities in U-Pb geochronology has allowed him to investigate the explosion of multi-cellular life in the Early Cambrian \u2013 the single most important evolutionary event in Earth history \u2013 and to examine the mechanisms of the most significant catastrophic events in the history of life: the end-Permian and the end-Cretaceous mass extinctions. His relentless efforts as a field geologist in the Northwest Territories of Canada led to an understanding of the processes involved in the early growth of continental crust recorded in the 4 billion-year-old Acasta gneisses. Bowring\u2019s interests also extend to environmental applications of tracer isotopes using the isotopic composition of Pb, Sr, and U in natural waters to examine the fate and transport of contaminants.Sam Bowring is a geologist interested in using U-Pb geochronology to constrain the rates of geologic processes and to calibrate the timing of significant events in the geologic record.  His unwavering pursuit of the highest possible capabilities in U-Pb geochronology has allowed him to investigate the explosion of multi-cellular life in the Early Cambrian \u2013 the single most important evolutionary event in Earth history \u2013 and to examine the mechanisms of the most significant catastrophic events in the history of life: the end-Permian and the end-Cretaceous mass extinctions.

VMy research in probability theory mainly involves models from interacting particle systems, stochastic networks, and branching processes. Most of these models are motivated by phenomena or problems arising in mathematical physics, mathematical biology, engineering, and computer science. This includes the study of Gaussian free fields and the rate of decrease of the particle density for certain particle systems; the study of particle systems such as voter models and the contact process that are motivated by the movement of populations and spread of disease; and the study of the stability and large scale behavior of queueing networks, which includes the paradoxical behavior of queueing networks with slower input than service, which nonetheless may be unstable.My research in probability theory mainly involves models from interacting particle systems, stochastic networks, and branching processes.

VNumerous structured RNAs remain to be discovered that are derived from the noncoding portions of the genomes of cells from all three domains of life. Many of these RNAs will prove to function as novel riboswitches that respond to essential metabolites or other ligands. Breaker seeks to discover and validate the functions of riboswitches to reveal otherwise hidden regulatory networks. Since some riboswitches control the expression of essential genes in bacteria, he and his research team is exploring the possibility of creating new classes of antibacterial compounds that target RNAs. In some instances, the newfound RNAs are unusually large and appear to represent novel classes of ribozymes. Since the known ribozyme classes carry out critical biochemical functions such as protein synthesis and RNA processing, these new ribozyme candidates will allow us to broaden the known repertoire of natural enzymes made of RNA.Numerous structured RNAs remain to be discovered that are derived from the noncoding portions of the genomes of cells from all three domains of life.

VMarianne Bronner\u2019s laboratory has a long-standing interest in the central question of developmental biology:  how a complex organism develops from a single cell.  Her studies center on the molecular mechanisms underlying formation and evolution of the neural crest, a highly multipotent stem cell population that gives rise to melanocytes of the skin, craniofacial skeleton and peripheral ganglia.  Many of these cell types are prone to metastasis in the adult, for example contributing to melanoma and neuroblastoma, and these cancers often possess transcriptional signatures similar to those of embryonic neural crest cells. A major focus is the identification of the signaling and transcriptional interactions that lead to neural crest formation both at the tissue and the molecular level.  Using a multiorganismal approach, their studies have combined gain- and loss-of-function approaches with genome-wide transcriptome profiling and regulatory analysis.  This has led to the discovery of a neural crest gene regulatory network that is largely conserved to the base of vertebrates.  As neural crest cells are amongst the most migratory cell type in vertebrate embryo, the Bronner lab also has been interested in characterizing the role of the migratory environment in influencing pathway choice.Marianne Bronner\u2019s laboratory has a long-standing interest in the central question of developmental biology:  how a complex organism develops from a single cell.  Her studies center on the molecular mechanisms underlying formation and evolution of the neural crest, a highly multipotent stem cell population that gives rise to melanocytes of the skin, craniofacial skeleton and peripheral ganglia.  Many of these cell types are prone to metastasis in the adult, for example contributing to melanoma and neuroblastoma, and these cancers often possess transcriptional signatures similar to those of embryonic neural crest cells.

VFrom various material remains recovered archaeologically Brown studies the social processes that created evolutionary change in low-density part-time agriculturalists of the eastern United States. Examples include the rise of population aggregation centers with massive earthworks at different times and places. Specifically, Mound City (OH), Cahokia (IL) and Spiro (OK) have been the subject of detailed analyses to reveal the ritual practices, including the treatment of the dead, that index the social and political factors that made these locations of particular importance at specific times. Current interest has been engaged in the identification of specific social processes that continue through long periods of time and leave their imprint on such topics as settlement aggregation, food production, institution building, craft production, and image production.From various material remains recovered archaeologically Brown studies the social processes that created evolutionary change in low-density part-time agriculturalists of the eastern United States.

VBrown uses ground and space based telescopes to both conduct wide-field surveys to discover new objects in our solar system and to perform detailed investigation of individual members of our solar system. He was involved in the discovery of most of the largest objects in the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune, including Eris, the most massive dwarf planet, the discovery of which eventually led to the demotion of Pluto, and Sedna, still the only know member of the region of space beyond the Kuiper belt. In addition to discovering these objects, Brown and his group provided the first analyses of the characteristics and properties of this group of bodies, leading to insights into giant impacts in the outer solar system, loss of atmospheres on dwarf planets, radiation processing of volatile ices, and the formation of dwarf planets. In addition he has studied planetary processes on satellites of the giant planets, including global circulation in Titan's atmosphere, the chemistry of Europa's ocean, and the effects of Io's volcanoes on Jupiter's magnetosphere.Brown uses ground and space based telescopes to both conduct wide-field surveys to discover new objects in our solar system and to perform detailed investigation of individual members of our solar system.

Using mouse molecular genetics, I have focussed on the formation of skeletal and cardiac muscle. We first studied contractile protein genes, and then investigated the upstream gene hierarchies that control the onset of skeletal myogenesis.

Our studies on skeletal muscle extend to regeneration in the adult, where we have demonstrated the major role of the muscle satellite cell in response to injury or degenerative disease.

VBull currently works on (i) the use of phages and phage products to treat bacterial infections, (ii) the engineering of viral genomes to achieve long term attenuation that will not revert to high virulence, and (iii) evolution of resistance to gene drive systems. The phage work uses a combination of purely in vitro studies with E. coli, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, and others to discover how best to suppress bacterial numbers with phages. Mouse infections are used to test treatment efficacy, both with phages and enzymes derived from phages. The engineering of attenuation is also done with phages, where the goal is to suppress viral fitness and then subject the engineered phages to long term growth, observing whether fitness recovers. Some genomic designs lead to effectively permanent attenuation, such that the virus would not be able to recover original fitness levels. The work on evolution of resistance to gene drive systems is in its infancy and is so far limited to population genetics models to predict the various ways that a population may evolve in response to a gene drive system that harms the population.Bull currently works on (i) the use of phages and phage products to treat bacterial infections, (ii) the engineering of viral genomes to achieve long term attenuation that will not revert to high virulence, and (iii) evolution of resistance to gene drive systems.

VI am a field geologist with a focus on tectonic geomorphology and the interactions among climate, erosion, and tectonics. I attempt to quantify landscapes, geologic structures, and the sedimentary record in order to reconstruct the growth and decay of mountain belts. My primary focus is on young, collisional mountain ranges, such as the Himalaya, the Tien Shan, or the Southern Alps of New Zealand, where strong climatic contrasts, rapid erosion and deformation, and high degrees of spatial and temporal variability permit interactions among these forcing functions and responses to be teased apart. Through use of new techniques and data sets, such as reliable remote-sensing of global rainfall, high-resolution digital topography, and cosmogenic nuclide dating, my group and collaborators have succeeded in quantifying rates of erosion, rainfall, and fault slip at time scales ranging from years to many millennia. These studies have served to define the extent to which temporal or spatial variability in erosion rates is driven by corresponding climatic variability, how landscapes and erosional processes change in response to different rates of tectonic uplift, and whether the addition or removal of loads due to erosion or deposition affects rates of tectonic deformation.I am a field geologist with a focus on tectonic geomorphology and the interactions among climate, erosion, and tectonics. I attempt to quantify landscapes, geologic structures, and the sedimentary record in order to reconstruct the growth and decay of mountain belts. My primary focus is on young, collisional mountain ranges, such as the Himalaya, the Tien Shan, or the Southern Alps of New Zealand, where strong climatic contrasts, rapid erosion and deformation, and high degrees of spatial and temporal variability permit interactions among these forcing functions and responses to be teased apart.

VAdam Burrows' major research interests include the theories of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and supernovae.  In the realms of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, his major focus is on their evolution, spectroscopy, and atmospheres, with particular emphasis on understanding their structures, chemistry, and spectral signatures in aid of the numerous international campaigns of discovery and characterization. He was one of the first exoplanet theorists in the world, having explored the properties of giant exoplanets in advance of their first detection in 1995. In the general realm of supernovae, he investigates the theories of their explosions and the associated computational, neutrino, and gravitational-wave astrophysics, along with their X-ray and $\u005cgamma$-ray signatures. Much of his supernova research is also in support of ongoing efforts to understand the origins of neutron stars, pulsars, and stellar-mass black holes, as well as the elements of Nature.  In the subjects of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and supernovae, he has written numerous influential papers and reviews, has collaborated with more than 300 co-authors on more than 350 research papers, and has given more than 300 invited talks and colloquia.Adam Burrows' major research interests include the theories of exoplanets, brown dwarfs, and supernovae.  In the realms of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, his major focus is on their evolution, spectroscopy, and atmospheres, with particular emphasis on understanding their structures, chemistry, and spectral signatures in aid of the numerous international campaigns of discovery and characterization.

VCynthia Burrows leads a research team investigating the chemical structures and mechanisms by which DNA and RNA bases, notably guanine, undergo transformations under conditions of oxidative stress. These studies underlie the biology of age-related disorders such as cancer. Inflammation, metabolism and radiation generate reactive oxygen species that alter the structure of guanine in such a way as to affect the integrity of the genome, leading to mutations in DNA and to changes in both duplex and quadruplex folding patterns. The Burrows laboratory uses the tools of organic chemistry to synthesize and characterize site-specifically modified DNA and RNA strands, allowing the study of proteins that interact with modified bases such as those involved in replication, transcription and repair. Notably, Burrows and coworkers identified hyperoxidized hydantoin lesions in DNA that are highly mutagenic and appear to play significant roles in signaling for DNA repair. Nanopore technology employed by the group has moved this field forward by providing a single-molecule method of analyzing the effects of base damage on DNA folding and opens the door to single-molecule sequencing of DNA modifications.Cynthia Burrows leads a research team investigating the chemical structures and mechanisms by which DNA and RNA bases, notably guanine, undergo transformations under conditions of oxidative stress.

VI have pursued a single-cell approach to investigate the immune system. By recording membrane current in individual T lymphocytes, my research group identified five distinctive types of ion channel and found agents that block them. Using channel blockers, we showed that specific calcium, potassium, and chloride ion channels comprise a functional network and are required during an immune response for changes in gene expression, cytokine secretion, cell proliferation, and motility; as well as controlling membrane potential, intracellular calcium levels, and cell volume homeostasis. Agents that block a specific voltage-gated potassium channel, named Kv1.3, are proving effective in treating animal models of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. My laboratory has also worked on a voltage-independent calcium channel in T lymphocytes that is triggered to open following recognition of antigen. RNA interference screening led us to the discovery of two proteins -- Stim and Orai -- that together form the molecular basis of the calcium channel. We are presently investigating how STIM proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum activate plasma membrane Orai subunits to form conducting Ca2+ channels. In addition, we are using two-photon microscopy to investigate cellular choreography in lymphoid organs and to evaluate candidate immunosuppressants in vivo.I have pursued a single-cell approach to investigate the immune system.

VEmmanuel\u2019s work lies at the interface of mathematics, statistics, information theory, signal processing and scientific computing, and is about finding new ways of representing information and of extracting information from complex data. For example, he helped launch the field known as compressed sensing, which is a mathematical technique that has led to advances in the efficiency and accuracy of data collection and analysis, and can be used to significantly speed up MRI scanning times. More broadly, he is interested in theoretical and applied problems characterized by incomplete information. His work combines ideas from probability theory, statistics and mathematical optimization to answer questions such as whether it is possible to recover the phase of a light field from intensity measurements only as in X-ray crystallography; or users\u2019 preferences for items from just a few samples as in recommender systems and/or fine details of an object from low-frequency data as in microscopy. His most recent research is concerned with the development of statistical techniques addressing the issue of the irreproducibility of scientific research (the fact that many follow up studies cannot reproduce early findings).Emmanuel\u2019s work lies at the interface of mathematics, statistics, information theory, signal processing and scientific computing, and is about finding new ways of representing information and of extracting information from complex data.

VCane continues to work on El Niño prediction, and on the impact of El Niño and climate generally on human activity, especially agriculture, health, and, most recently, conflict.  Current work aims to describe and understand the preferred natural modes of variation internal to the climate system on interannual to decadal timescales and longer.  An aspect of this work is to consider the occurrence of decadal regimes from a dynamical systems perspective with attention to their predictability. Other work focuses on the difference in the response to greenhouse gases and to natural variations in solar output and volcanic aerosol. The expression of climate variability in extended droughts is a particular focus because of their impacts on agriculture and conflict.  These topics overlap with an interest in paleoclimate problems, from the Pliocene to the last millennium, and the light they shed on future climate change.Cane continues to work on El Niño prediction, and on the impact of El Niño and climate generally on human activity, especially agriculture, health, and, most recently, conflict.  Current work aims to describe and understand the preferred natural modes of variation internal to the climate system on interannual to decadal timescales and longer.  An aspect of this work is to consider the occurrence of decadal regimes from a dynamical systems perspective with attention to their predictability.

VRoberto Car's research focuses on the electronic and atomistic structure of material and molecular systems. Car is the inventor, with Michele Parrinello, of the ab-initio molecular dynamics method that initiated a new field of numerical simulations. In this approach atomic trajectories are generated \u201con the fly\u201d from the quantum-mechanical ground state of the electrons, capturing the interplay of nuclear dynamics and chemical bond evolution. Car used this approach in groundbreaking studies of liquid and amorphous systems and to investigate temperature and pressure induced phase transitions. Recently, he focused at understanding the network of hydrogen bonds in water, its dependence on hermodynamic conditions and its role in solvation processes. He is especially interested on the consequences of nuclear quantum dynamics on the equilibrium molecular structures and on the electronic excitations and spectral properties. Car is also devoting effort to combine ab-initio simulations with coarse-grained models and advanced sampling ethodologies to study the slow relaxation processes of the hydrogen bond network that underlie ice nucleation. Two other areas of Car's research include the theory of open quantum systems and new computational schemes for electronic correlation.Roberto Car's research focuses on the electronic and atomistic structure of material and molecular systems.

VNancy Carrasco's main area of interest is transport across biological membranes, particularly by the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the key plasma membrane protein that mediates active iodide uptake in the thyroid. Carrasco's group cloned NIS and has made great strides in characterizing it at the molecular level. NIS is at the center of the treatment for thyroid cancer based on administering radioiodide post-thyroidectomy, the most effective targeted internal radiation cancer therapy ever devised. Carrasco's group has discovered that functional NIS is endogenously expressed in breast cancer, opening up the possibility that this disease too could be treated with radioiodide. Carrasco's group has investigated the function and regulation of NIS in extrathyroidal tissues and in cancer to extend the clinical use of NIS beyond thyroid disease. They have obtained key structure/function information on NIS and identified amino acid residues that play crucial roles in substrate binding, translocation, specificity, and stoichiometry, and in targeting NIS to the cell surface. They are currently using these findings to optimize NIS molecules for use as reporter and therapeutic molecules in gene transfer studies. Carrasco's group has demonstrated that NIS transports different anion substrates with different stoichiometries, and is working to elucidate the structural basis for this versatility. They have also shown that NIS actively transports the anion perchlorate, an environmental pollutant. This suggests that the health effects of exposure to perchlorate are more serious than previously thought.Nancy Carrasco's main area of interest is transport across biological membranes, particularly by the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the key plasma membrane protein that mediates active iodide uptake in the thyroid.

VNancy Carrasco, a leader in the study of membrane transporters, was the first scientist to clone and extensively characterize at the molecular level the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the key plasma membrane protein that mediates the active transport of iodide in the thyroid. Numerous scientists had sought to identify this transporter for decades, owing to its physiological and pathophysiological significance. Carrasco's pioneering findings on NIS include key mechanistic information on the protein\u2014obtained largely by determining the molecular requirements of NIS at positions bearing mutations in patients\u2014as well as the discovery that NIS transports different substrates with different stoichiometries; that it actively transports the environmental pollutant perchlorate, settling a longstanding controversy; and that it is expressed in the lactating breast and in breast cancer. Carrasco received her MD and Master's in Biochemistry degrees from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in her native Mexico City. She was a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. H. Ronald Kaback's laboratory at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology. Carrasco joined the faculty at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1987 and the Yale School of Medicine in 2011.

VThe key to high-efficiency genome editing is the creation of a highly specific DNA double-strand break in the desired genomic target. The platforms that facilitate this are the programmable nucleases: zinc-finger nucleases, TALENs and CRISPR-Cas. Investigators around the world are applying these reagents to genome manipulations for many purposes in a wide range of species, from research in model organisms, to improvement of crop plants and livestock, to medical applications in humans. Dana Carroll\u2019s laboratory investigates the design of these nucleases, their delivery to cells and organisms, the fundamental DNA repair mechanisms that process the nuclease-induced breaks, and translation of this knowledge to methods for manipulating genomic DNA sequences. There are multiple pathways of double-strand break repair, and manipulating them can enhance desired genome alterations, including new mutations, gene corrections and sequence insertions. Past work in the Carroll lab showed that disabling the dominant mutagenic pathway increases the recovery of precise corrections and insertions. Current work focuses on the role of chromatin structure in determining the efficiency of nuclease cleavage at various genomic targets.The key to high-efficiency genome editing is the creation of a highly specific DNA double-strand break in the desired genomic target.

VJean-Laurent Casanova is pediatrician and immunologist by training, and has in practice become a human geneticist investigating the immunological basis of childhood infectious diseases. He has been recognized for his paradigm\u2010shifting discoveries, demonstrating that life-threatening infectious diseases striking otherwise healthy children may be caused by single\u2010gene inborn errors of immunity, including variations underlying mycobacterial diseases (IFN\u2010\u03b3 immunity), invasive pneumococcal disease (TIR), herpes simplex virus encephalitis (TLR3), and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (IL\u2010 17).

VKathy Cashman is a volcanologist who studies volcanic systems from the magma reservoir to the Earth\u2019s surface using the combined tools of field observations and measurements, sample analysis for chemical and physical characteristics, laboratory experiments and theoretical models. The most distinctive aspect of her work is her use of all constituent phases of volcanic samples (glass, crystals and vesicles) to quantify the kinetics of phase transformations and relate these to temporal changes in the physical properties of volcanic materials. She has used this approach to study the emplacement of lava flows, conditions of magma storage and eruption, and generation of volcanic ash. One example is the combined use of melt inclusion and textural analysis to address conditions of magma storage and ascent, generally, and the role of decompression-related degassing more specifically. This work highlights the critical role of shallow water loss on crystallisation of both groundmass and phenocryst phases. From a volcanological perspective, Cashman has used these data to show that feedbacks among processes of magma ascent, degassing, crystallisation and magma rheology have important implications for both patterns of precursory behaviour and controls on volcanic eruption styles. Her work has had significant impacts in the fields of igneous petrology, physical volcanology, and magmatic processes, and has stimulated new areas of research in experimental petrology and volcano studies.Kathy Cashman is a volcanologist who studies volcanic systems from the magma reservoir to the Earth\u2019s surface using the combined tools of field observations and measurements, sample analysis for chemical and physical characteristics, laboratory experiments and theoretical models.

VThe central focus of Chakraborty\u2019s lab is to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of the adaptive immune response to pathogens, and then to harness this understanding to help design better vaccines and therapies. The work represents a crossroad of the physical and life sciences. Lab members work on developing and applying theoretical and computational approaches (rooted in statistical physics) to study the collective, dynamic, and stochastic processes that underlie a systemic immune response. A hallmark of Chakraborty\u2019s research is the close synergy and collaboration between his lab\u2019s theoretical/computational studies and investigations led by experimental and clinical immunologists. Current interests can be divided into three broad categories: understanding the network of biochemical interactions that enable T cells to translate engagement of membrane receptors to cognate ligands in to functional responses, how T cell development results in T cells that are specific for unknown and emerging pathogens, and the human immune response to HIV. The goal of the last effort is to guide the rational design of vaccines and therapies against infectious disease causing agents, like HIV, that have plagued humanity since antiquity.The central focus of Chakraborty\u2019s lab is to understand the mechanistic underpinnings of the adaptive immune response to pathogens, and then to harness this understanding to help design better vaccines and therapies.

VMy research involves understanding the molecular genetic basis of human disease, running the gamut from Mendelian to oligogenic to complex, using experimental, quantitative and animal model approaches.  My laboratory  has made fundamental contributions to studies of polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium, both their biology and as tools for trait mapping.  These mapping studies, including GWAS (genome-wide association studies) required our collaborative development of genotyping technology (with Affymetrix) and computational methods for genome-wide screens. We pioneered GWAS in autism, hypertension and sudden cardiac death, revealing a diversity of novel genes contributing to their genetics. We also have a long history of studying the population genetics of deleterious alleles in isolated communities (Old Order Mennonites, Arab Israeli villages). Of these, the most significant and continuous effort has gone towards the genetic dissection and functional understanding of Hirschsprung disease, a model complex disorder where we have made fundamental and substantive contributions to understanding how mutations in genes specifying early neural crest-derived enteroblasts and their interaction with the gut mesenchyme led to this disorder of gut innervation.

VDavid Charbonneau\u2019s research focusses on the detection and characterization of planets orbiting other stars, known as exoplanets, with the goal of studying inhabited worlds. He leads the MEarth project, which consists of two arrays of telescopes that survey the closest and smallest stars to find temperate, terrestrial worlds that pass in front of (or transit) their stars. In 2017 his team announced the discovery of the first planet that was known to be rocky, transit, and orbit within the habitable zone of a nearby small star. By studying the transmission of starlight when it passes through the atmosphere of a planet, Dr. Charbonneau and his team deduce the chemical composition of the exoplanet atmosphere. In the future, he seeks to use this method to detect combinations of gases that would indicate the presence of life. His focus on low-mass stars as exoplanet targets has also led to several discoveries concerning the physical processes by which theses stars maintain magnetic fields, and how they lose angular momentum as they age. He is a co-investigator in the NASA TESS Mission, scheduled for launch in 2018, which will search for the closest transiting exoplanets and hence the ones most accessible to detailed characterization.David Charbonneau\u2019s research focusses on the detection and characterization of planets orbiting other stars, known as exoplanets, with the goal of studying inhabited worlds.

VCharlesworth's research is in the general area of evolutionary biology.  His early work was on the theory of selection in age-structured populations.  This showed that, while there is no universal exact measure of fitness in this case, useful approximations for describing the effects of selection on life-history traits can be obtained.  He applied these results to evolutionary theories of aging, and pioneered tests of these theories, using Drosophila melanogaster as experimental material. His later work involved application of population genetics methods to studies of the evolution of many different aspects of genetic systems, including genetic recombination, inbreeding and outbreeding mechanisms, separate sexes and sex chromosomes, segregation distortion, and repetitive DNA. He contributed extensively to the theory of background selection, according to which the elimination of selectively deleterious mutations can affect patterns of molecular variation and evolution at sites that are linked to the targets of selection. He has helped to develop and apply methods for estimating selection on both coding and non-coding sequence variants within populations. He has also contributed to a variety of other topics in evolutionary biology, including kin selection theory, methods for measuring evolutionary rates from fossil data, and genetic mechanisms of speciation.Charlesworth's research is in the general area of evolutionary biology.  His early work was on the theory of selection in age-structured populations.  This showed that, while there is no universal exact measure of fitness in this case, useful approximations for describing the effects of selection on life-history traits can be obtained.  He applied these results to evolutionary theories of aging, and pioneered tests of these theories, using Drosophila melanogaster as experimental material.

VEmmanuelle Charpentier\u2019s laboratory is interested in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating physiology, virulence and infection in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Her laboratory investigates how RNAs and proteins coordinate to modulate gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level. They study regulatory RNAs and proteins in various biological pathways such as horizontal gene transfer, adaptation to stress, physiology, persistence, virulence, infection and immunity. In particular, her laboratory researches on DNA- and RNA-mediated interference systems in the defence against genetic elements (CRISPR-Cas), small regulatory RNAs that have roles in pathogenic processes, protein quality control that regulates bacterial adaptation, physiology and virulence, and the mechanisms of bacterial recognition by immune cells. A greater understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of regulation in pathogens is critical to generate new findings in basic science and possibly translate them into novel biotechnological and biomedical applications (e.g. genome editing tools, anti-infective strategies). A successful example of the application of Charpentier basic research in biotechnology and medicine is her recent discovery of an RNA-guided DNA cleavage mechanism that has been harnessed as an RNA programmable genome engineering technology and that stems from her analysis of the adaptive immune CRISPR-Cas9 system in bacterial pathogens.Emmanuelle Charpentier\u2019s laboratory is interested in understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating physiology, virulence and infection in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.

Through large-scale follow-up studies, they have discovered multiple disorders caused by arsenic in drinking water and characterized dose-response relations between ingested arsenic and risk of cancers, vascular diseases, neurological disorders, hypertension, diabetes and cataract. WHO and US EPA have used their findings to set up a new maximal contamination level of arsenic in drinking water to protect health and life of hundred millions of victims. They have documented the efficacy of hepatitis B immunization to prevent fatal hepatic diseases and liver cancer, which has led to the use of vaccines, antivirals or antibiotics to prevent infection-related cancers. Their REVEAL study on the natural history of chronic hepatitis B and C has pioneered the viral load paradigm in clinical management of viral hepatitis, and has developed risk calculators through the combination of host and viral biomarkers to precisely predict long-term risk of diseases induced by oncogenic viruses.Chien-Jen Chen\u2019s research team is interested in the long-term health risk assessment and molecular and genomic biomarkers of chronic arsenic poisoning and chronic infection of oncogenic viruses.

VUsing Arabidopsis as the model, studies in the Chen lab investigate the biology of small RNAs, which are classified into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants. With genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches, they have been studying the molecular mechanisms that govern the biogenesis, degradation, and mode of action of small RNAs. They are best known for the discovery of an essential step in small RNA biogenesis - the methylation of plant miRNAs and siRNAs on their 3' terminal ribose by the small RNA methyltransferase HEN1. Subsequent studies from others show that piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are similarly methylated by HEN1 homologs in animals. Efforts to uncover the role of methylation in small RNA metabolism have led to further pioneering studies on the molecular mechanisms of small RNA degradation. They have discovered two molecular processes that degrade small RNAs and the major players carrying out these processes. These processes of small RNA turnover have also been shown to be conserved in animals. The Chen lab also studies the mechanisms of cell fate specification in plant development, and has uncovered critical roles of miRNAs in the patterning of floral organs. Recent studies have revealed subcellular partitioning of small RNAs between the cytosol and membrane compartments, and begun to implicate the endomembrane system in the activity and cell-to-cell movement of small RNAs.Using Arabidopsis as the model, studies in the Chen lab investigate the biology of small RNAs, which are classified into microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in plants.

VDorothy Cheney\u2019s research focuses on the social behavior and cognition of wild primates, notably vervet monkeys in Amboseli National Park (1977-1988) and baboons in the Moremi Reserve, Botswana (1992-2008).

VCherlin\u2019s field of research is best described as family demography: the causes and consequences of demographic changes in the family lives of parents and children. He has written widely on this topic during a period of intense change in family life in the U.S. and the world. During the first two decades of his career, much of his research and writing focused on union formation and dissolution. His 1978 article on the lack of cultural and social support for families formed by remarriage after divorce remains the most highly-cited article on remarriage. His 1981 book, revised and updated in 1992, demonstrated that the 1950s was the most unusual period of family life in the twentieth century. In a 1991 interdisciplinary study with several collaborators, he found that a substantial share of the seeming effects of divorce on children were present before the parents separated.Cherlin\u2019s field of research is best described as family demography: the causes and consequences of demographic changes in the family lives of parents and children.

VAs a chemist, initially crystallographer, I have developed new technologies for analyzing and synthesizing large, macromolecular assemblages ranging in size from tRNAs to human genomes. Conceiving of molecular multiplexing and barcode tags in 1980 lead to the first direct genomic sequencing approach, then to automation used for the first commercial genome sequence, for the pathogen, Helicobacter in 1994. This evolved into Fluorescent In Situ Sequencing (FISSeq) in 1999, ABI-SOLiD in 2006, the only open-source device (Polonator.org) in 2007, Complete Genomics in 2008, and consumer-directed genomics (Knome, 23andme). Work on organic synthesis of oligonucleotide arrays and homologous recombination in the 1990s lead to research on synthetic, minimal, in vitro protein synthesis and photosynthetic production of alkanes from carbon dioxide (at Joule and LS9). I found that intimate early views of new technologies offered the obligation and opportunity to develop novel ethics, safety and security strategies including construction of radically new cellular genomes with genetic codes that could protect from all viruses and other genetic exchanges. Such considerations also launched the Personal Genome Project to integrate human genomic, environmental and trait data, providing the world's only IRB-approved open-access source for such data.As a chemist, initially crystallographer, I have developed new technologies for analyzing and synthesizing large, macromolecular assemblages ranging in size from tRNAs to human genomes.

VMy research is centered upon the development and application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules and their complexes in solution. Particular emphasis is being placed on novel approaches to extending NMR to larger and more complex systems, especially complexes involved in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation, and exploring fundamental questions associated with protein dynamics, macromolecular interactions and recognition processes. Currently we are exploiting the unique properties of NMR to detect and characterize sparsely-populated states of macromolecules. Many important biological processes proceed through transient intermediate states that comprise only a small fraction of the overall population of a molecular system at equilibrium, and, as a result, are invisible (i.e. dark) to conventional biophysical techniques (including crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and single molecule spectroscopies). These studies, which have provided new insights into macromolecular recognition, rely on the ability of NMR to amplify, through exchange phenomena, the effect of the invisible "dark" state on some NMR observable (generally a relaxation property) so that its footprint is readily observed in measurements on the NMR visible species. Examples of such phenomena that we have studied include the search processes whereby transcription factors locate their specific DNA binding site within an overwhelming sea of non-specific DNA; the role of encounter complexes in protein-protein association; the interplay of conformational selection and induced fit in protein-ligand interactions; and transient interactions of intrinsically disordered and partially folded polypeptides with large megadalton macromolecular assemblies including highly heterogeneous aggregates involved in amyloid protofibril formation.My research is centered upon the development and application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study the structure and dynamics of biological macromolecules and their complexes in solution.

VThe research focus of the Coates laboratory is the development of new catalysts for the synthesis of macromolecules as well as fine chemicals. Coates\u2019 research centers on developing new methods for reacting commodity feedstocks (such as alkenes, epoxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide) in unprecedented ways. Current research focuses on four primary themes, the first of which is the development of homogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization, heterocycle carbonylation, epoxide homo- and copolymerization, and the utilization of carbon dioxide in polymer synthesis. The second area of interest is the utilization of naturally occurring building blocks such as terpenes, saccharides, and plant-based oils for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers. A third focus area is polymer electrolytes for energy storage (batteries, supercapacitors) as well as energy conversion (hydroxide exchange fuel cells). The fourth area of investigation is the development of materials that allow more efficient recycling of commodity plastics, and promote improved properties of current commercial polymers.The research focus of the Coates laboratory is the development of new catalysts for the synthesis of macromolecules as well as fine chemicals.

VJudith Cohen is interested in using the chemical abundances of stars to infer the history of our Milky Way galaxy, the formation of the Galactic halo, and the properties of other "local" galaxies as well as those of the high-redshift Universe. She modeled the integrated light of simple stellar systems to determine their age and metallicity. Subsequently, she and her team of postdoctoral fellows pursued detailed abundance analyses of globular cluster red giant stars, as well as the very rate extremely metal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo, looking for patterns that could be used to determine the nucleosynthetic origin of the elements. This helped to establish that the trends of abundance ratios with overall metallicity can be understood in most cases by the normal nucleosynthetic processes operating in massive stars at their deaths via core collapse supernova explosions combined with ejecta from thermonuclear explosions on white dwarfs. A careful study of the stable isotopes of magnesium in dwarf stars led to a better understanding of when various nuclear reaction chains within stars each began to make significant contributions to the interstellar gas in the Milky Way. With postdoctoral fellow Jorge Melendez, she carried out the first extremely high precision detailed abundance analysis of dwarf stars, looking for evidence of planets via very small changes in the ratios of refractory to volatile elements in the host star. Her current work focuses on using RR Lyr variables to study the outer halo of our galaxy.  From roughly 1986 to 1995, she and the late J.B. Oke (professor of astronomy, Caltech) led the team that built the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph, one of the first light instruments at the Keck Telescopes, which is still very popular and in active use.Judith Cohen is interested in using the chemical abundances of stars to infer the history of our Milky Way galaxy, the formation of the Galactic halo, and the properties of other "local" galaxies as well as those of the high-redshift Universe.

VIn almost any system, microorganisms are responsible for most of the aerobic respiration and all of the anaerobic respiration. Thus, the production of carbon dioxide, methane, sulfide as well as the regeneration of other inorganic nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) is largely due to the activities of these microorganisms. I am particularly interested in the biotic and abiotic regulation of microbial metabolism, energy flow and carbon cycles in lakes, rivers and marine systems. More recently I have been working on the fates of terrestrial C in aquatic systems and the role that inland waters have on the global carbon balance). It turns out that inland waters are quite significant in both the global and regional balances of C in terms of both the storage of organic C in lake and reservoir sediments and in the oxidation of terrestrially derived organic materials. These terrestrially derived organic materials also have the potential to subsidize aquatic food webs, another area of active research for me.In almost any system, microorganisms are responsible for most of the aerobic respiration and all of the anaerobic respiration.

VJames J. Collins' laboratory is focused on using engineering principles and molecular biology techniques to model, design and construct synthetic gene networks. They have created genetic toggle switches, RNA switches, genetic counters, microbial kill switches, synthetic bacteriophage to combat resistant bacterial infections, synthetic probiotics to detect-and-treat infections, synthetic mRNA for stem cell reprogramming, and tunable mammalian genetic switches. Recently, the Collins lab developed paper-based synthetic gene networks, a technology platform that forms the basis for inexpensive, in vitro diagnostic tests (e.g., Ebola) and portable molecular manufacturing (e.g., vaccines) in the developing world. The lab's work in synthetic biology has enabled multiple biomedical applications, including in vivo biosensing, antibiotic potentiation, biofilm eradication, in vitro pathogen detection, rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing, identification of antibiotic counterfeits, drug target identification/validation, microbiome reengineering, and efficient stem cell reprogramming. The Collins lab also uses network biology approaches to study antibiotic action, bacterial defense mechanisms, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance, with the goal of utilizing the insights gained from these studies to enhance our existing antibiotic arsenal and develop novel means to treat resistant and persistent bacterial infections.James J.

VMy primary interest is the homeostatic regulation of energy stores by the central nervous system. When we cloned the melanocortin receptors and elucidated the role of the agouti proteins as endogenous antagonists of these receptors, we identified the central melanocortin circuits as a critical component of the adipostat. These circuits appear to coordinate long-term adipostatic signals with short term hunger and satiety signals, and to coordinate energy intake with expenditure. We continue to focus on the specific physiological mechanisms involved in these homeostatic processes mediated by central melanocortin signaling. For example, even haploinsufficiency of the melanocortin-4 receptor causes profound hyperphagia in response to dietary fat, and we are studying the mechanisms involved. Our work utilizes a variety of techniques and model systems to better understand these signaling pathways. We have characterized the central melanocortin circuits in the zebrafish to be able to apply unbiased forward genetics to identification of the genes involved in this system. We have recently initiated clinical studies of melanocortin obesity syndrome in children. Finally, since MC4R haploinsufficiency is the most common cause of severe obesity known, and excessive MC4R activation appears to play a role in disease cachexia, we are using high throughput screening to identify small molecule allosteric modifiers of MC4R function. These may be used to test the hypothesis that modulation of receptor activity may be used to treat disorders of energy homeostasis.My primary interest is the homeostatic regulation of energy stores by the central nervous system.

VIn recent years, the Crabtree laboratory has collaborated with a wide variety of colleagues in pursuit of answers to the tough problems posed by solar and wind energy. Their intermittancy requires some type of storage such as conversion to fuels. The Energy Sciences Institute at Yale is the focus for one aspect of the work. Here the problem is to find suitable electrically conductive or nonconductive linkers between catalysts or photosensitizers and electrode surfaces. The Main Campus work relates to developing catalysts for water splitting to oxygen and hydrogen or other fuel molecules. Other recent topics include catalytic conversion of biomass to useful products and development of hydrogen borrowing catalysts that bring about novel organic transformations. The lab contributes some of these results to the ANSER EFRC headquartered in the Chicago area and funded by the Department of Energy.In recent years, the Crabtree laboratory has collaborated with a wide variety of colleagues in pursuit of answers to the tough problems posed by solar and wind energy.

VAt Yale since 1977, Bob Crabtree is now Whitehead Professor. In early work, he reversed homogeneous catalytic alkene hydrogenation to attain the goal of alkane dehydrogenation. The so-called 'Crabtree catalyst' has proved useful for mediating certain challenging transformations and has therefore seen broad use. This was followed by work on H2 complexation to metals and finding a new type of hydrogen bond that he called the dihydrogen bond. Recently, he developed water oxidation and C-H bond hydroxylation with iridium catalysts in connection with the problem of green catalysis and alternative energy production. He has been ACS and RSC organometallic chemistry awardee, Baylor Medallist, Dow, Williams and Mond lecturer, Centenary awardee, has chaired the ACS Inorganic Division and is the author of a textbook in his field. He is a Fellow of the American Chemical Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry, the International Union of Pure & Applied Chemistry and the American Academy as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences.At Yale since 1977, Bob Crabtree is now Whitehead Professor.

VOur research group is interested in mapping biochemical pathways that play fundamental roles in mammalian physiology and disease and to use this knowledge to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of human disorders. To achieve these goals, we develop and apply new technologies that bridge the fields of chemistry and biology, such as the chemical proteomic method activity-based protein profiling, which utilizes active site-directed small-molecule probes for the global analysis of enzyme function in native biological systems. We complement these efforts in technology development with focused studies on individual enzymes, in particular, enzymes that regulate chemical transmission in the nervous system, cancer, and metabolism. Notably, our enzyme characterization projects both benefit from and provide a fertile testing ground for technological innovations. Thus, through the integration of two complementary research programs, one dedicated to methods development for functional proteomics, and the other to the in-depth analysis of key signaling enzymes, our group achieves a unique balance that cultivates the creation and rapid implementation of cutting-edge technologies that address unmet needs in biomedical research.Our research group is interested in mapping biochemical pathways that play fundamental roles in mammalian physiology and disease and to use this knowledge to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of human disorders.

Her earliest work clarified trends in mortality, disability, other indicators of population health, and healthy life expectancy. Crimmins\u2019 work has also been important in clarifying how health differentials arise in the population. For instance men have a higher prevalence of heart disease than women which comes from their earlier rates of onset of heart disease; however, the length of time spent with heart disease is longer for women. Other work has shown that women\u2019s longer life with cognitive impairment comes largely from their longer life rather than from more cognitive loss at a given age. Work on race and education differences in life expectancy has shown the earlier aging of the disadvantaged through the earlier onset of health conditions among persons of lower SES leading to shorter lives, fewer healthy years, and more years of life lost or never lived. Crimmins more recent work has expanded traditional demographic approaches by integrating indicators of physiological states into analysis to determine how social and economic circumstances \u201cget under the skin.\u201dMuch of Crimmins\u2019 has focused on changes both in health and mortality both over time in populations and among individuals.

VJohn Cronan\u2019s laboratory is interested in the diversity of lipid synthetic pathways in bacteria. Although some enzymes of fatty acid synthesis are very strongly conserved, others show remarkable diversity. Unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and the last step of the canonical fatty acid synthesis cycle both show significant differences in the enzyme proteins utilized and their enzymatic mechanisms. Other interests are in the synthesis and attachment of the fatty acid-derived cofactors, biotin and lipoic acid. Multiple pathways are evident for both cofactors, although not yet clearly understood. Finally the laboratory studies the synthesis of various fatty acid containing signaling molecules used by bacterial species to coordinate gene expression in response to environmental changes.John Cronan\u2019s laboratory is interested in the diversity of lipid synthetic pathways in bacteria.

VPatricia Crown studies the production, consumption, exchange, and discard of artifacts in the past, particularly archaeological ceramics. To understand who made ceramics and how they were used, she has conducted analyses of ceramic composition and residues in collaboration with scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, the Smithsonian Conservation Analytical Laboratory, and the Hershey Company. Her dissertation research focused on the ceramics from a small pueblo occupied for about 25 years, examining variation in household inventories across the site. A post-doctoral detailed examination of Salado polychrome ceramics revealed that this widespread pottery appeared when migrant populations from the northern Southwest moved into already occupied areas, was widely produced in these areas of ethnically diverse populations, and was associated with the appearance of a belief system involving prayers for rain. An ongoing study of how children learned to make ceramics in the past compares distinct communities of practice and the sequence of learning in many different parts of the Southwest, discovering variable paths to skilled knowledge with adults often working closely with novices to teach aspects of the craft while gaining from their labor.Patricia Crown studies the production, consumption, exchange, and discard of artifacts in the past, particularly archaeological ceramics.

VChristopher Cummins\u2019 laboratory is conducting exploratory synthesis investigations aimed at reaction discovery and the uncovering of new kinds of chemical linkages and molecular structures. The synthesis of three-coordinate molybdenum(III) complexes led to the finding of N2 reductive scission. Nitric oxide deoxygenation afforded chromium(VI) nitride complexes. White phosphorus transformation by niobium complexes allowed for development of P3-transfer reactivity culminating in the synthesis of the AsP3 molecule. Methods have been developed for generation of the P2 molecule as a highly reactive, transient intermediate, leading to chlorine-free routes for phosphorus incorporation into organic molecules. P2 transfer to the azide ion gave rise to an inorganic \u201cclick reaction\u201d and provided the planar P2N3\u2212 anion, a simple aromatic species composed exclusively of phosphorus and nitrogen.

VMy laboratory studies how cells and antigens come together to generate immune responses. This involves a focus on deciphering the cues that guide immune cell movements within, and egress from, lymphoid organs. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a major class of chemoattractant receptor on immune cells and we have used gain- and loss-of function approaches to establish roles for several GPCRs that respond to protein (chemokine) and lipid (sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), endocannabinoid and oxysterol) ligands and to study how these responses adapt after exposure to antigen or inflammatory inputs. We established that lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs is mediated by S1PR1 and defined enzymatic mechanisms acting to maintain high S1P levels at egress sites. We found CD69 acts a repressor of S1PR1 and we continue to study how this and other egress regulators work. We have a strong interest in understanding how cell interaction dynamics influence the selection events underlying antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers. We use real-time intravital 2-photon microscopy procedures to study these dynamics and are working on tools for the in vivo quantitation of cell-cell interaction and cell signaling in germinal centers. We have also begun exploring requirements for barrier immunity in lymphoid organs and at epithelial surfaces. This includes an interest in the cues guiding cell positioning at these surfaces and the factors required for mounting intestinal IgA antibody responses.My laboratory studies how cells and antigens come together to generate immune responses.

VEric D'Asaro\u2019s research centers on understanding the physics of the upper ocean and its interactions with biogeochemistry. For the past 25 years, his group has designed, built and operated "Lagrangian floats", a new class of robotic oceanographic instruments that accurately follow the three dimensional motion of water parcels, particularly in regions of strong mixing. Tracing the motion of water effectively measures previously inaccessible aspects of turbulence and mixing, while also mimicking the motion of chemical species and plankton, thereby giving unique insights into their dynamics. Different problems can be addressed by equipping the floats with different sensors, and changing, through software, how they respond to their environment. Through a series of multi-investigator field campaigns targeted at specific physical and biogeochemical processes and appropriately combining the floats with other robotic instruments and ships, the group has worked to build and test quantitative models of these phenomena. These continuing efforts target air-sea interactions in hurricanes and typhoons, interactions between surface and internal waves and turbulence, submesoscale and frontal dynamics, oxygen minimum zones and the North Atlantic spring bloom.Eric D'Asaro\u2019s research centers on understanding the physics of the upper ocean and its interactions with biogeochemistry.

More recently, using genome-wide gene sequencing and gene expression analysis, his group has elucidated a more complete landscape of the genome of these malignancies. They have identified the normal function as well as the contribution to B-cell transformation of recurrently altered genes by using in vitro studies and conditional mouse models reproducing the lesions in germinal-center B cells, the normal counterpart of most B cell malignancies.

VThe well-known metals in biology on oxygen-rich Earth that govern life processes as biocatalysts in enzymes or as structural elements, are typically bound within complicated organic ligands by oxygen and nitrogen, sometimes sulfur, donors to the trace transition metal ions. As holdovers from an age when earth was under a reducing atmosphere, some enzymes in microorganisms that perform reductive reactions, contain iron, sometimes nickel, stabilized in low-valent states by simple diatomic molecules such as carbon monoxide and cyanide, and involve two metals bridged by sulfur. Marcetta Darensbourg, her group and her collaborators design, synthesize and characterize inorganic/organometallic compounds that mimic the active sites of hydrogenases; they uncover molecular features critical to structure and function of these evolutionarily perfected biocatalysts for hydrogen metabolism. Such small molecular models, even without the protein superstructure, show some activity as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, fulfilling a goal in base metal catalysis involving metal hydrides. Nature\u2019s control of the diatomics, CO and cyanide, obviates a poisoning effect on the microorganism host, and suggests their genesis on iron.

VMarcetta York Darensbourg is an inorganic/organometallic chemist whose earlier synthetic expertise and mechanistic studies of low valent transition metal hydrides have evolved into current efforts towards the development of synthetic analogues of enzyme active sites that contain metal-carbon bonds--especially the carbon monoxide- and cyanide-stabilized iron centers in hydrogenases that are known from spectroscopies and protein crystallography. Biomimetics are designed to reproduce key structural, spectroscopic and reactivity features of the natural organometallic catalysts that connect to the catalytic electrochemical mechanisms of these natural fuel cell catalysts, as well as carbon-carbon coupling processes as in acetyl-coA synthase.

VDr. Darnell is a physician scientist who has pioneered next-generation approaches to understanding RNA genomics in human disease. He is a world\u2019s expert in the study of the paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PNDs), diseases associated with cancer, tumor immunity and autoimmune brain disease. Much of the lab has focused on translational studies of the PNDs, proposing that they provide a basic approach to understanding brain specific functions co-opted by tumor cells, as well as the best documented example of naturally occurring human tumor immunity amenable to study. The lab\u2019s studies of disease mechanism, discovering PND antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in these patients, was foundational to the new field of immuno-oncology. He developed molecular approaches to understanding disease pathogenesis and discovering the presence of neuron-specific systems for RNA regulation in the brain, and developing HITS-CLIP, the gold-standard for studying RNA-protein interactions in vivo. The basic lab combined genetic approaches with biochemistry and new methods development to study RNA regulation in neurons. The lab discovered rules predicting brain-specific alternative splicing, showing the first evidence for biologic coherence of RNA regulation in vivo. This work developed into a general understanding of how genome-wide RNA-binding maps predict protein-RNA regulation, in which the position of binding determines the outcome of RNA regulation, first discovered with Nova and now found to be true for a host of RNA regulatory proteins (Nature 2006, 2008). The lab also developed Ago HITS-CLIP (Nature 2009), a precise means of pinpointing protein-RNA and miRNA-mRNA regulatory sites on a genome-wide basis, and hence a means to understand the interactions regulating RNA expression.Dr. Darnell is a physician scientist who has pioneered next-generation approaches to understanding RNA genomics in human disease.

VMy laboratory research is focused on antibiotic: their discovery, mode of action, mechanisms of resistance and their functions in the environment. With respect to resistance, we are studying the role of wastewater treatment as a means of amplifying and disseminating resistance genes. Metagenomic studies indicate that a wide variety of resistance genes are present in treatment plants and that these are assembled in a variety of clusters in transferable elements such as plasmids and phage. As a side project we are isolating bacteriophage that use Gram-negative pathogens as hosts in an attempt to develop phage-antibiotic combinations as novel therapeutic treatments for multi drug resistance pathogens. We are applying genetic and metagenomic approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics from various sources. In this case we are not screening for compounds with antibiotic activity but for novel biosynthetic pathways in microbial populations. Finally my laboratory is working on novel approached to antimicrobial therapy by studying the mode of action of "therapeutic" clays.My laboratory research is focused on antibiotic: their discovery, mode of action, mechanisms of resistance and their functions in the environment.

VUsing embryos of the frog Xenopus, De Robertis has studied the conserved molecular machinery that regulates cell differentiation. With his mentor, Nobel laureate Sir John Gurdon, he carried out studies in the molecular reprogramming of somatic nuclei transplanted into oocytes. At the University of Basel, during one of the most exciting periods of modern biology, he collaborated with his colleague Walter Gehring to isolate the first vertebrate development-controlling gene, now called HoxC6. The discovery that Hox genes were conserved between vertebrates and fruit flies marked the beginning of the new scientific discipline of evolution and development, Evo-Devo. At UCLA, De Robertis\u2019 laboratory dissected the molecular mechanisms that mediate embryonic induction of cell differentiation, a phenomenon first described by Nobel laureate Hans Spemann. Starting with a dorsal homeobox gene called goosecoid, he then isolated several secreted factors that pattern the embryo. A new paradigm was provided by Chordin, a protein secreted by dorsal cells that binds Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) growth factors, facilitating their transport through the space between ectoderm and mesoderm to the ventral side, where Chordin is digested by Tolloid protease liberating BMPs for signaling. Remarkably, the Chordin morphogenetic gradient determines dorsal to ventral tissue differentiations in most bilateral animals.Using embryos of the frog Xenopus, De Robertis has studied the conserved molecular machinery that regulates cell differentiation.

VThroughout his career, Angus Deaton\u2019s research has focused on understanding how people behave and on how to measure their wellbeing, understood to encompass material wellbeing, health, and happiness. His early work was concerned with consumer behavior, with how households allocate their spending across different goods and services, and how they respond to changes in prices and incomes. Such models are necessary for designing policies that make people better off, especially policies on taxation, planning, or antitrust. He has also tried to understand how people make decisions about saving, for example for retirement; saving is a key, not only for individual wellbeing, but also for macroeconomics. In his work on spending and on saving, a key focus has been aggregation, on how individual behavior adds up to the economy as a whole. In recent years, Deaton\u2019s analysis of wellbeing has expanded beyond material wellbeing, to health status, and to self-reports of happiness and life evaluation. He has worked on the measurement of poverty, both globally and nationally, and on the measurement of the multilateral international price indexes that are used to compare the cost of living between different countries. He has wrestled with national accounts statistics and household survey data in a sometimes-fruitless attempt at reconciliation, and to provide credible measures of growth, poverty, and inequality.Throughout his career, Angus Deaton\u2019s research has focused on understanding how people behave and on how to measure their wellbeing, understood to encompass material wellbeing, health, and happiness.

The models can be computationally \u201clesioned\u201d to mimic the error patterns of individual patients, thus allowing for the model to diagnose each individual\u2019s deficit. In addition, model parameters can be correlated with patient lesion locations with the result that model functions can be mapped onto brain regions.Gary Dell studies language production, the processes through which thoughts become spoken words.  Dell and colleagues have developed computational models of production that explain the nature and likelihood of speech errors.  These models are constrained by data from linguistics, neuroscience, and psychology.  Dell\u2019s experimental work tests predictions of the models by examining speech production under controlled conditions, and particularly the speech errors that arise in these conditions.  More recently, the models have been applied to language production deficits, such as aphasia resulting from damage to language areas of the brain.

VOver the last twenty years of independent research career at Yale University, Prof. Deng's research mainly centers on the molecular and biochemical mechanism for how light regulates plant development. Using Arabidopsis model, his group has identified a dozen of pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS loci responsible for mediating light control of plant development. They further demostrated that those COP/DET/FUS genes encoding proteins constitute three protein machineries involved in targeting photomorphogenesis-promoting factors for degradation by the 26S proteasome, in response to external stimuli. Two of those complexes defined two novel multiproetin complex E3 ligases (COP1 complexes and CDD complex) and the other is the well-conserved COP9 signalosome, a general eukaryotic Cullin-based E3 ligases regulator with de-rubbylation activity. Professor Deng lab are now applying both molecular/genetic and genomic approaches to further analyze the action mechanism of those novel cellular machineries, which are conserved among all multicellular organisms. Those discoveries made in plant model in Deng lab has significant implications in general biology research as well as those studies relationg to human health. Recently work from many groups including Deng lab have show the general conservation of those three complexes in all multicellular organism and their fundamental roles in a variety of developmenal and cellular processes. Over the last few years, Deng lab has initiated another area of research: genome-wide analysis of the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure/gene expression in rice and their role in rice heterosis.

One is the genetic, molecular and biochemical mechanism for light regulated seedling development in Arabidopsis, ongoing for the last 22 years under the NIH support. We have discovered a dozen pleiotropic COP/DET/FUS loci responsible for mediating light control of seedling development. Their encoded proteins constitute three protein machines involved in targeting photomorphogenesis-promoting factors for degradation by the 26S proteasome, in response to external stimuli. From time to time in the past, new aspects derived this NIH funded program were assisted by additional funds from NSF and other sources. Another research area is a relative new and an endeavor in last ten years, genome-wide analysis of the relationship between epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure/gene expression in maize, rice and Arabidopsis, and using those genome wide platforms to understand genome basis of the plant heterosis. The genomic platforms developed here have critically helped my lab to taking advantages of the genome approaches in my NIH funded effort on light control of development.My laboratory research centers in two areas.

VRonald DeVore is a mathematician recognized for his work in applied mathematics, particularly those areas that interface numerical analysis, partial differential equations, data processing, machine learning and approximation of functions. DeVore was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Eastern Michigan University in 1964 and then obtained a doctoral degree in mathematics from Ohio State University in 1967 under the supervision of Ranko Bojanic. From 1968 to 1977, DeVore was at Oakland University and in 1977 he became a professor at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, where he served as the Robert L. Sumwalt Professor from 1986-2005. From 1999-2005 he served as the director of the Industrial Mathematics Institute, of which he co-founded.

VRaymond Deshaies\u2019s laboratory works on mechanisms of protein homeostasis in eukaryotic cells. They are particularly interested in the role of protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Protein degradation via the UPS serves two general functions: it is employed to regulate pathways such as the cell cycle, and it is critical for quality control of the cellular proteome. Cells express ~600 or so ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzymes that promote ubiquitin conjugation to substrate proteins. Cullin\u2013RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) comprise a family of ~250 multisubunit E3s that function in many different regulatory pathways. The Deshaies group has studied how CRL enzymes assemble, how their activity is regulated by reversible modification with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8, how they promote catalysis, and what their substrates and cellular functions are. Another major focus is to understand how protein quality control works and how its malfunction or therapeutic manipulation relates to human diseases. This interest has motivated work on the mechanism, regulation, substrates, and inhibitors of the segregase p97/VCP, which plays a critical role in multiple cellular quality control pathways.Raymond Deshaies\u2019s laboratory works on mechanisms of protein homeostasis in eukaryotic cells.

VDouglas W. Diamond does theoretical research on financial intermediaries, financial crises, and liquidity His research agenda has been to explain what banks do, why they do it, and the consequences of these arrangements. Diamond\u2019s earliest research explained how the economic role of banks generated an essential link between the properties of their assets and the form of their liabilities; he showed how the bank\u2019s special assets (special because banks monitor special information about business borrowers) forced them to finance themselves with debt liabilities (deposits) rather than equity and also led banks to diversify across many loans. Research with Philip H. Dybvig demonstrated how banks specializing in creating liquid liabilities (deposits) to fund illiquid assets (such as business loans) may be unstable and give rise to bank runs and a need for deposit insurance. Diamond studied the role of short-term debt in corporate and bank capital structures. Research with Raghuram Rajan studied how banks can use the threat of bank runs to allow them to borrow more than the liquidation value of illiquid bank loans and examines the implications of this financial structure.Douglas W.

He has made a wide range of important contributions to our understanding of the structure and dynamics of proteins, and in a series of seminal studies he has transformed our knowledge of the mechanism of protein folding, a key step in the translation of genetic information into biological function, and of protein misfolding, a process that is now known to be the origin of some of the most debilitating medical disorders in the modern world, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and type II diabetes. Through the highly innovative exploitation of a wide variety of biophysical and biochemical techniques he has in particular developed a fundamentally new paradigm for understanding the nature of protein misfolding and its consequences, and hence of the underlying generic origins of the diseases with which it is associated. His research has provided a molecular explanation of the recent dramatic proliferation of these highly debilitating disorders and established the foundations for the novel and rational discovery of vitally important therapeutic strategies for their prevention and cure.Chris Dobson's research activities throughout his career have been focused at the interfaces of the physical, biological and medical sciences.

VWe investigate the generation of neuronal diversity and neural circuit formation in Drosophila andmouse. More specifically, our current focus is on characterizing genes that regulate temporal identity withinDrosophila neural stem cell lineages, identifying mechanisms of neural circuit formation for Drosophila larvallocomotion, and identifying and characterizing lamina-specific genes that are required for neural circuitformation and function in the mouse visual cortex.

Together with Gerard Laumon, he originated the so-called geometric Langlands program (with automorphic sheaves playing the role of automorphic functions). He also did some other work in algebraic geometry and algebra (classification of instantons, integrable systems, quantum groups, DG categories, chiral algebras, character sheaves on unipotent groups).

VWheat provides roughly 20% of the calories consumed by the human population and further increases in production and nutritional value are needed to sustain the growing human population. The major goal of Dr. Dubcovsky's research program are to gain a better understanding of the effects of allelic variants of wheat genes that are relevant to agriculture and to develop the tools required for an efficient manipulation of these genes in wheat improvement. The molecular markers, wheat genetic maps, wheat BAC libraries, transcriptome sequences and reverse genetic tools generated in Prof. Dubcovsky's laboratory have empowered wheat researchers world-wide to map useful traits and to deploy favorable alleles into commercial varieties.

VI am a veterinarian parasitologist interested in transmission of zoonotic parasitic diseases from animals to humans, and the discovery of new diseases that cause crippling diseases in humans and animals. I am most associated with the discovery of the transmission of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii to humans and animals through feces of cats and by eating undercooked infected meat. One-third of humanity is infected with T. gondii, and toxoplasmosis causes birth defects and loss of vision in humans and abortion in livestock. I cultivated and named the single celled parasite Neospora caninum, that causes abortion in cattle and crippling disease in companion animals. I also named the parasite Sarcocystis neurona that causes a fatal neurologic disease in horses in Americas. There are no effective vaccines or drugs to eliminate these parasites in tissues.  Control measures for these diseases and/or prevention of transmission to humans are based on farm management practices and hygienic measures based largely on the research that we have published.I am a veterinarian parasitologist interested in transmission of zoonotic parasitic diseases from animals to humans, and the discovery of new diseases that cause crippling diseases in humans and animals.

VCatherine Dulac is interested in the neural mechanisms underlying instinctive behaviors in mice. In earlier work she developed single cell cDNA cloning strategies to characterize novel families of pheromone receptors in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), thus providing new avenues of research into the logic of the pheromone-evoked responses in mammals. Her group identified key signaling molecules associated with pheromone detection, developed molecular strategies to uncover signals detected by individual VNO receptors, and investigated the functional organization of discrete pheromone-evoked behaviors circuits. Using new viral, genetic, and electrophysiological strategies to gain information about the brain processing of pheromone signals, her laboratory revealed the key role of VNO inputs in insuring the sex-specificity of pheromone evoked-behaviors, and demonstrated that functional neuronal circuits underlying male and female-specific behaviors co-exist in the brain of both sexes. Recently, her group uncovered a set of hypothalamic neurons expressing the peptide galanin that governs male and female paternal behavior in mice. In addition, her laboratory performed a genome-wide characterization of genomic imprinting in the adult and developing mouse brain, and uncovered large number of novel genes with parent-of-origin allelic expression differences, underscoring genomic imprinting as a major mode of epigenetic regulation in the brain.Catherine Dulac is interested in the neural mechanisms underlying instinctive behaviors in mice.

VI spent the first 25 years of my career at the University of Michigan working on and ultimately directing the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data collection project. Since 1968, the PSID has collected economic, demographic, health, behavior and attainment data from a representative sample of U.S. individuals and the households in which they reside. With these and other data I have studied the economic mobility of the U.S. population, both within and across generations, with a particular focus on low-income families. More specifically, I have investigated the roles families, peers, neighborhoods and public policy play in affecting the life chances of children and adolescents. My research has highlighted the importance of early childhood as a sensitive period for the damaging influences of economic deprivation as well as for the beneficial impacts of policy-induced income increases for working families. The focus of my more recent research has shifted from these environmental influences to the comparative importance of the skills and behaviors developed during childhood. In particular, I have sought to understand the relative importance of early academic skills, cognitive and emotional self-regulation, and health in promoting children's eventual success in school and the labor market.I spent the first 25 years of my career at the University of Michigan working on and ultimately directing the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data collection project.

VDwork studies privacy-preserving data analysis, from the theoretical limits on what is feasible to the development of differentially private algorithms, as well as the regulatory and policy frameworks for adoption of privacy-preserving technology. In addition, Dwork is currently engaged in two new directions of research: defining and ensuring fairness in classification, and the development of a general technique for ensuring the validity of statistical analyses under adaptivity, that is, when the questions asked depend on the data themselves. More broadly, her research agenda is to frame real-life societal problems in a rigorous way and lay down a mathematically rigorous theoretical groundwork for addressing them; to continue to invest effort in ongoing efforts such as privacy and fairness; and to inform the policy and regulatory debate on relevant issues from a position of strong technical understanding.Dwork studies privacy-preserving data analysis, from the theoretical limits on what is feasible to the development of differentially private algorithms, as well as the regulatory and policy frameworks for adoption of privacy-preserving technology.

VCynthia Dwork, a Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft Research, spearheaded a successful effort to place privacy-preserving analysis of data on a firm mathematical foundation. A cornerstone of this work is differential privacy, a strong privacy guarantee frequently permitting highly accurate data analysis. Previous positions include research staff member at IBM Almaden Research Center (1985 - 2000) where Dwork and her colleagues launched non-malleable cryptography, the subfield of modern cryptography that studies -- and remedies -- the failures of cryptographic protocols to compose securely. She is a co-inventor of proofs of computational effort, a concept at the heart of a popular crypto-currency, and co-inventor of the first public-key cryptosystem whose security depends on the worst-case, rather than average-case, hardness of the underlying problem. Dwork is a recipient of the Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize, recognizing some of her earliest work for establishing the pillars on which every fault tolerant system has been built for more than two decades. She is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, and the US National Academy of Engineering, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is a founding editor of the Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality. Dr. Dwork received her B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University and her Ph.D. in computer science from Cornell University.Cynthia Dwork, a Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft Research, spearheaded a successful effort to place privacy-preserving analysis of data on a firm mathematical foundation.

VKathryn Edin studies poverty by deploying ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and mixed method approaches to the domains of welfare and low-wage work, family life, and neighborhood contexts. She has taken on key mysteries about the urban poor that weren\u2019t been fully answered by quantitative work, including: How do single mothers possibly survive on welfare? Why don\u2019t more go to work? Why do they end up as single mothers in the first place? Where are the fathers and why do they disengage from their children\u2019s lives? How have the lives of the single mothers changed as a result of welfare reform? Her work has convinced many in the poverty-research community that deep insight into the lives of the poor requires both surveys and systematic qualitative explorations. A primary contribution of her research, beyond its substantive and theoretical merit, is thus the linkage between surveys and qualitative components. Now considered mainstream, this method has been incorporated into many of the most important national poverty studies. She has authored five books with a sixth forthcoming and some 50 journal articles.Kathryn Edin studies poverty by deploying ethnographic observations, in-depth interviews, and mixed method approaches to the domains of welfare and low-wage work, family life, and neighborhood contexts.

VThe Edwards lab wishes to understand how the basic properties of neurotransmitter release influence synaptic transmission and plasticity, behavior and neuropsychiatric disease. Using selection in a toxin that causes parkinsonism, they identified the first transporter that packages a classical transmitter into synaptic vesicles, implicating this activity in neural degeneration. The vesicular monoamine transporter defined a family of proteins that includes the vesicular acetylcholine transporter and the Edwards lab subsequently identified two other unrelated families that transport GABA and glutamate into synaptic vesicles. They also developed methods to elucidate the function, mechanism and regulation of these intracellular transporters. Using electrophysiology, they have shown that the vesicular glutamate transporters undergo an unusual form of allosteric regulation by Cl- and H+, and also exhibit an uncoupled Cl- conductance. Current work focuses on the role of these properties in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Since the vesicular transporters define the cells and vesicles capable of transmitter release, the group has also used them to establish the phenomenon of neurotransmitter corelease, in which a single neuron releases two classical transmitters. In addition, they have used targeting of the vesicular monoamine transporter to dense core vesicles to elucidate formation of the regulated secretory pathway that mediates release of peptide hormones and neural peptides. The work has diverse implications for behavior and disease, and Robert Edwards focuses on the pathogenesis of Parkinson\u2019s disease, in particular the function of the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein that has a central role in this disorder.The Edwards lab wishes to understand how the basic properties of neurotransmitter release influence synaptic transmission and plasticity, behavior and neuropsychiatric disease.

VScott Edwards\u2019 research focuses on diverse aspects of the evolutionary biology of birds, including evolutionary history and biogeography, disease ecology, population genetics and comparative genomics.  To study avian phylogeography he conducted extensive fieldwork in Australia and produced some of the first continent-wide phylogeographic analyses based on DNA sequencing.  He did a postdoctoral fellowship in immunogenetics at the University of Florida to study the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of birds, an important multigene family encoding receptors that mediate pathogen recognition and surveillance, as well as mate choice.  He helped develop the House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) as an emerging model system for studying the evolutionary consequences of pathogens on animal hosts, focusing on genome-wide effects on sequence change and gene expression of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum.  His work on the MHC led him to study the large-scale structure and dinosaurian origins of the avian genome.  In the last 10 years Dr. Edwards has helped develop novel methods for estimating phylogenetic trees from multilocus DNA sequence data using coalescent theory.  His recent work uses comparative genomics in diverse contexts to study macroevolutionary patterns in birds, including the origin of feathers and the evolution of flightlessness.Scott Edwards\u2019 research focuses on diverse aspects of the evolutionary biology of birds, including evolutionary history and biogeography, disease ecology, population genetics and comparative genomics.  To study avian phylogeography he conducted extensive fieldwork in Australia and produced some of the first continent-wide phylogeographic analyses based on DNA sequencing.  He did a postdoctoral fellowship in immunogenetics at the University of Florida to study the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of birds, an important multigene family encoding receptors that mediate pathogen recognition and surveillance, as well as mate choice.  He helped develop the House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) as an emerging model system for studying the evolutionary consequences of pathogens on animal hosts, focusing on genome-wide effects on sequence change and gene expression of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum.  His work on the MHC led him to study the large-scale structure and dinosaurian origins of the avian genome.  In the last 10 years Dr. Edwards has helped develop novel methods for estimating phylogenetic trees from multilocus DNA sequence data using coalescent theory.  His recent work uses comparative genomics in diverse contexts to study macroevolutionary patterns in birds, including the origin of feathers and the evolution of flightlessness.Scott Edwards\u2019 research focuses on diverse aspects of the evolutionary biology of birds, including evolutionary history and biogeography, disease ecology, population genetics and comparative genomics.  To study avian phylogeography he conducted extensive fieldwork in Australia and produced some of the first continent-wide phylogeographic analyses based on DNA sequencing.  He did a postdoctoral fellowship in immunogenetics at the University of Florida to study the evolution of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of birds, an important multigene family encoding receptors that mediate pathogen recognition and surveillance, as well as mate choice.  He helped develop the House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) as an emerging model system for studying the evolutionary consequences of pathogens on animal hosts, focusing on genome-wide effects on sequence change and gene expression of the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma gallisepticum.  His work on the MHC led him to study the large-scale structure and dinosaurian origins of the avian genome.  In the last 10 years Dr. Edwards has helped develop novel methods for estimating phylogenetic trees from multilocus DNA sequence data using coalescent theory.  His recent work uses comparative genomics in diverse contexts to study macroevolutionary patterns in birds, including the origin of feathers and the evolution of flightlessness.

VJohn Eiler\u2019s research group focuses primarily on developing technologies for determining the isotopic structures of natural molecules (i.e., the proportions of molecular forms having different numbers and/or sites of rare-isotope substitutions), and applying those technologies to understand the chemical physics of isotopes and to solve applied problems in Earth history, environmental science, and planetary science. Advances stemming from this research include a new class of geothermometers based on measuring the proportions of doubly-substituted isotopic forms of molecules and mineral formula units, particularly for carbonate minerals and methane. These tools have provided new insights into the body temperatures of dinosaurs, Earth\u2019s climate in the distant geological past, the rates of elevation change in mountain belts, thermal histories of rocks from Mars and primitive asteroids, and the origins of thermogenic and biogenic natural gas. Ongoing developments focus on the technologies for and applied uses of measurements of diverse isotopologues of organic molecules, with applications in the natural and applied sciences.John Eiler\u2019s research group focuses primarily on developing technologies for determining the isotopic structures of natural molecules (i.e., the proportions of molecular forms having different numbers and/or sites of rare-isotope substitutions), and applying those technologies to understand the chemical physics of isotopes and to solve applied problems in Earth history, environmental science, and planetary science.

VDaniel Eisenstein works on a wide range of topics in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy, with particular interests in the large-scale structure of the Universe, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, and opportunities of large statistical data sets in astronomy. His largest effort has been in the use of the relic imprint of the baryon acoustic oscillations of the early Universe to provide a robust method for the measurement of the cosmic distance scale and the study of dark energy. He has conducted extensive theoretical and numerical investigations of the method and led the observational pursuit of this weak but important signature in the clustering of galaxies. The acoustic oscillations are now a central feature of several ambitious new galaxy surveys, with the goal of measuring cosmic distances to approaching 0.1% accuracy. Eisenstein has been active in the design, observation, and analysis of several large extragalactic surveys that provide detailed three-dimensional maps of the Universe. Through modern cosmological theory and simulations, the statistical clustering in these maps provides a powerful window to the study of the composition of the Universe and the evolution of galaxies.Daniel Eisenstein works on a wide range of topics in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy, with particular interests in the large-scale structure of the Universe, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, and opportunities of large statistical data sets in astronomy.

VI am a developmental/reproductive biologist studying the development of mammalian oocytes, the cells that become eggs. The focus of my research is on the complex interactions between developing oocytes and their companion follicular somatic cells, the granulosa cells. I found that oocytes are not simply passive recipients of nutrients and signals from ovarian follicular somatic cells, as once believed, but rather actively promote the functions of somatic cells needed to support oocyte development and regulate meiosis. I originated the concept of an oocyte-granulosa cell regulatory loop in which bi-directional communication between the oocyte and companion granulosa cells is essential for both normal oocyte and follicular development. A major goal of my current research is to define the components of this regulatory loop and their functions. I also achieved the first complete development of mammalian oocytes in vitro. This included in vitro initiation of primordial follicle development, oocyte growth, and acquisition of competence to undergo maturation, fertilization, and, after transfer of preimplantation embryos to foster mothers, the birth of live young. Finally, I am the Principal Investigator of a Program Project to develop mouse mutant models of infertility using ENU mutagenesis.I am a developmental/reproductive biologist studying the development of mammalian oocytes, the cells that become eggs.

VJames Estes\u2019 laboratory is interested in the behavioral ecology of large predators and the impacts of these animals on other species and ecological processes. They have explored the effects of sea otter predation on temperate reef ecosystems by first defining the food web\u2019s structure through observational studies and then documenting the dynamic consequences of various consumer-prey interactions by contrasting islands of the Aleutian archipelago as sea otter populations waxed and waned following their near-extinction by the Pacific maritime fur trade. They have shown that sea otters enhance kelp forests by limiting populations of herbivorous sea urchins; that the effects of this trophic cascade extend widely through coastal ecosystems to other species and ecological processes; that predation by sea otters and their recent ancestors decoupled the coevolution of defense and resistance by marine plants and their herbivores; and that North Pacific kelp forests have been further influenced by events in the open sea that caused killer whales to begin preying on sea otters, thus driving otter populations downward and altering their effects on coastal ecosystems through the otter-urchin-kelp trophic cascade. Using this system as a model, they have helped identify the ecological and evolutionary influences of large predators across global ecosystems and the resulting consequences of widespread losses of these species on numerous features of the world we live in.James Estes\u2019 laboratory is interested in the behavioral ecology of large predators and the impacts of these animals on other species and ecological processes.

Using this system as a model, they have helped identify the ecological and evolutionary influences of large predators across global ecosystems and the resulting consequences of widespread losses of these species on numerous features of the world we live in.James Estes\u2019 laboratory is interested in the behavioral ecology of large predators and the impacts of these animals on other species and ecological processes.

VJames Estes is Distinguished Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Estes is a wildlife ecologist, recognized for his work on the ecosystem-level influences of large predators. He is known especially for studies of sea otters and kelp forest ecosystems, from which he demonstrated the enhancing influence of predators on the distribution and abundance of plants through what has since come to be widely known as a \u201ctrophic cascade. Estes was born in Sacramento, California, in 1945. He graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in zoology in 1967, subsequently obtaining a Masters in Biology from Washington State University in 1969 and a Ph.D. in biology and statistics from the University of Arizona in 1974. He was employed as a research scientist by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey from 1974 to 2007, after which he joined the faculty at the University of California at Santa Cruz. In recognition of his work\u2019s scientific and societal impacts, Estes received the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Schumaker Award for excellence in science communication, the Western Society of Naturalists\u2019 Lifetime Achievement Award, and the American Society of Mammalogists\u2019 C.

VCraig Evans' research program mostly concerns nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) and related variational and optimization problems. The task of rigorous nonlinear PDE theory is deducing the existence and other properties of solutions, usually without having explicit formulas. This entails deriving hard analytic estimates, and then using these to formulate the proper notion of "solution", often very problem specific. Evans' best work establishes regularity, or sometimes just partial regularity, for solutions of fully nonlinear elliptic PDE (independently done by Krylov), minimizers of quasiconvex energy functions, stationary harmonic maps, etc. He has worked intensively as well on the Crandall--Lions theory of viscosity solutions for certain fully nonlinear PDE, developing applications to stochastic optimal control theory,pattern formation for reaction-diffusion systems (with P. Souganidis), nonlinear averaging effects, mean curvature motion (with J. Spruck), etc.Craig Evans' research program mostly concerns nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) and related variational and optimization problems.
