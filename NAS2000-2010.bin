VFor over two decades, my colleagues and I have used molecular genetics to clarify the molecular basis of cancer, focussing on the role of chromosome translocations in lymphoma development. We (and others) discovered that the hallmark translocation in Burkitt lymphoma activates the Myc proto-oncogene by coupling it to an immunoglobulin locus. To prove its etiological role, we showed that mice bearing a Myc transgene that mimics the chromosome junction are highly predisposed to lymphomagenesis. These transgenic mice and others we developed have proven very effective for dissecting tumorigenesis and, more recently, for studying new approaches to therapy. Our most influential discovery has been the critical role of impaired cell death in cancer development and resistance to therapy. Our laboratory revealed that the Bcl-2 gene, discovered by others via its translocation in follicular lymphoma, was oncogenic because it imposes cell survival. Bcl-2 has proven to be the prototype of a family of proteins whose interactions arbitrate the life and death of cells. We are now attempting to clarify how those interactions flip the cell death (apoptosis) switch, how the effectiveness of that switch is impaired in cancer cells and how it can be reactivated to improve cancer treatment.For over two decades, my colleagues and I have used molecular genetics to clarify the molecular basis of cancer, focussing on the role of chromosome translocations in lymphoma development.

VAs a structural biologist, we are fundamentally interested in understanding the complex relationships between structure and function at both the molecular and cellular level. These interests have driven research programs aimed at understanding the mechanisms of assisted protein folding (pro regions and molecular chaperones), the mechanism of microtubule assembly, the structural basis for ligand specificity (alpha-lytic protease, estrogen receptors) and the architecture and function of cellular machines (centrosomes and chromosomes). In brief, our studies on alpha-lytic protease folding revealed that the native state need not be at a global free energy minimum. Our work on microtubule assembly has redefine the role of GTP and revealed that the lattice and not the nucleotide acts as the allosteric effector. Moreover, microtubule assembly proceeds via a 2D crystallization mechanism and not via a classic nucleation-polymerization model. Our studies of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone are uncovering the conformational dynamics of its ATPase cycle and providing new insights into its mechanism of client protein remodeling. With John Sedat, we have developed new widefield light microscopies that obtain resolutions well beyond the diffraction limit and have pioneered new approaches for automated EM tomography.As a structural biologist, we are fundamentally interested in understanding the complex relationships between structure and function at both the molecular and cellular level.

VTransport of water across cell membranes has long been regarded as a fundamental problem in physiology. This occurs through aquaporins, a large family of membrane water channel proteins discovered serendipitously in my laboratory. Of 10 presently recognized mammalian aquaporins each is expressed at specific cellular locations and participates in distinct physiological processes and clinical disorders. Expressed in multiple tissues, human AQP1 is the red-cell Co antigen, confers constitutive water reabsorption in the proximal tubules of kidney and mediates transport of water between capillaries into surrounding tissues. AQP2 is the vasopressin-regulated water channel of distal kidney, and mutations in human AQP2 result in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (inability to concentrate urine). Mutant forms of human AQP0 have been identified in some forms of congenital cataracts, and human AQP5 appears mistargeted in salivary and lacrimal glands from patients with Sjogren's syndrome (severe dry eye and dry mouth). Potential involvement of other aquaporins in clinical medicine is being pursued, and new aquaporins are being identified in mammals, microbes, and plants. Most aquaporins are simple water-selective pores, but some have broader permeabilities and molecular regulatory features. Understanding these functions may now be possible with the atomic structure of aquaporin proteins. The agre laboratory discovered the aquaporin water channels - the proteins that move water into and out of cells. Aquaporins participate in generation of biological fluids - spinal fluids, tears, sweat, pulmonary secretions, and urine. Aquaporins are involved in many clinical disorders - brain edema, dry eye, cataract, and renal concentration defects. Aquaporins are also found throughout the natural world including plants and microorganisms. The laboratory is currently investigating aquaporins in human disease.

VThe immune system can remember, sometimes for a lifetime, the identity of a pathogen and respond with much greater vigor upon re-encounter with the same microbe. This immunological memory is the defining characteristic of the adaptive immune response and forms the basis of vaccination against infectious diseases. The major focus of my research is to understand the mechanisms by which immune memory is generated and maintained and how memory cells are created. Our goal is to define the cellular and molecular basis of T and B cell memory and to use this knowledge to develop vaccines that will confer long-term protective immunity. We are also studying the mechanisms of T cell dysfunction during chronic viral infections and developing immune strategies for the treatment of chronic infections.The immune system can remember, sometimes for a lifetime, the identity of a pathogen and respond with much greater vigor upon re-encounter with the same microbe.

VMy paper in 1970 entitled "The Market for 'Lemons'" described the role of asymmetric information in market-destroying vicious circles. For example, in used car markets potential sellers of used cars, with superior information, withhold good cars from the market; buyers react by reducing their willingness to pay; and in turn sellers further reduce the quality of cars put up for sale. I have also worked on the application of sociology and psychology to the workings of the macroeconomy. I have used it observations from these two fields especially to explain the nature of unemployment and the business cycle, where a small amount of money illusion will make monetary policy effective.

VBased on an unexpected finding that MyD88 knockout mice are unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, I entered into research on innate immunity. By generating TLR family knockout mice, I identified ligands of many TLR members in addition to LPS receptor. Particularly, the identification of CpG DNA (pathogen-derived DNA) receptor as TLR9 is highly appreciated. This finding established a link between two arms of innate and acquired immunities. This result showed for the first time that TLRs are involved in viral recognition, and their recognition depends on the structure of nucleic acid. Until TLR ligands were identified, the response to all TLR ligands was considered to be identical and entirely dependent on MyD88. However, I showed for the first time the presence of MyD88-indepdent pathway in TLR signaling and showed that another adapter he named TRIF is involved in the MyD88-independent pathway. I demonstrated that the difference in signaling pathway among TLRs is due to selective usage of adaptor molecules such as MyD88 and TRIF. Recently, I showed that pathogen-derived RNA is recognized by cytoplasmic receptor family, besides TLRs, and clarified the molecular mechanism of antiviral response against RNA viruses.Based on an unexpected finding that MyD88 knockout mice are unresponsive to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria, I entered into research on innate immunity.

VI am in interested in understanding the neuronal structures and events that underlie visual perception, visual memory and visually-guided behaviors. Light reflected off of environmental objects and surfaces is cast as complex dynamic images upon the retina. Much is now known about how features of these retinal images are detected and represented by the activity of neurons in the primate cerebral cortex. My lab focuses on how these image features are integrated to form a perceptual whole, and on the ways in which sensory and behavioral context enable the observer to recover the specific environmental causes of the retinal image. To achieve these goals, we use behavioral assays of perceptual experience in humans and non-human primates, in combination with physiological recording of evoked activity from individual neurons and computational modeling of neuronal function. The neural substrates for visual motion perception have served as a convenient model system for these analyses, but our findings address general principles of sensory processing. Using this system, we have recently discovered that visual perception and visual imagery are mediated by common patterns of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex. More generally, my work is characterized by an effort to understand how the visual system operates under sensory conditions and behavioral demands that approximate the richness of normal perceptual experience.I am in interested in understanding the neuronal structures and events that underlie visual perception, visual memory and visually-guided behaviors.

VMy work in astrophysics concerns the search for "invisible" objects in the dark halo of the Milky Way, or in the outer Solar System. I pioneered the gravitational microlensing technique to search for evidence of massive objects in the cosmic dark matter. The project that I lead (the Macho Project) has recorded the photometric histories of over 60 million stars, and has found evidence that about 20 percent of the dark matter in the Milky Way is made up of dark objects of stellar mass. We also showed that planetary mass objects do not comprise a significant fraction of this dark component. More recently I have started working on the search for small objects in the Solar System beyond Neptune. Objects smaller than 30 kilometers in diameter are too faint for direct detection, and my team is developing an indirect technique based on searching for the occultations of stars by these objects. This project will have sensitivity to objects as small as 3 kilometers in diameter. I am also developing techniques for scientific discovery in the automated analysis of massive datasets.My work in astrophysics concerns the search for "invisible" objects in the dark halo of the Milky Way, or in the outer Solar System.

Our work contributed to clarify the stepwise mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and the involvement of GTP in the function of EF-Tu in bacteria or EF1 in eukaryotes in bringing the aminoacyl-tRNAs to the elongating ribosome in RNA complex. Subsequently we used the Xenopus oocyte system to study the involvement of adenylyl cyclase and G proteins in the induction of meiotic maturation.   In more recent years our laboratory has been studying the structure, function, and regulations of two ubiquitous protein kinases CK1 and CK2, which are involved in the phosphorylation of many key cellular proteins.My early work was in the field of protein synthesis, concentrating on the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and the elongation factors that participate in that process.

VAs a glaciologist, I have helped understand the climate records in ice cores, the potential for ice-sheet flow changes to affect sea level, and the influence of glaciation on landscapes. Through study of ice-core physical properties and processes, I contributed to improved annual-layer dating of the ice cores. We combined the accurate ages with flow modeling to estimate accumulation-rate histories, and used these to correct chemical records for changing dilution, and to combine borehole temperatures and isotopic data for paleothermometry. The improved confidence in ice-core paleoclimatology helped demonstrate the reality of large, widespread, abrupt climate changes, which were subsequently defined and interpreted by the National Research Council committee I chaired. Concerning ice flow, our interpretation and modeling of geophysical data identified water-saturated till as the most effective lubricant for ice streams. Our recent and ongoing work on ice-shelf buttressing of ice streams, sedimentary stabilization of grounding lines, iceberg calving, meltwater penetration of ice sheets, and related topics contributes to the understanding needed to predict ice-sheet changes, while our studies of supercooling of subglacial waters identified a key stabilizing feedback for glacier-valley profiles affecting mountain-belt evolution. In addition, I have aided policymakers and the public in assessing and publicizing these results.As a glaciologist, I have helped understand the climate records in ice cores, the potential for ice-sheet flow changes to affect sea level, and the influence of glaciation on landscapes.

VAs a physiologist, I have studied exocytosis and endocytosis, two processes fundamental to every cell. During exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and secrete their contents into the extracellular space. During endocytosis, the membrane thus added to the cell surface is taken back into the cell. In high-speed recordings, we observed the exocytosis of single vesicles, and discovered that membrane fusion starts with the opening of a pore no larger than that formed by some ion channels. Fusion often proceeds no further, and the vesicle simply re-seals. We wonder how such re-sealing is molecularly related to endocytosis. Now we image single vesicles by evanescent field fluorescence microscopy, and track their membranes through exo- and endocytosis. By labeling individual proteins in different colors, we observe their recruitment and release by single organelles, and also record the minute movements executed by the organelles as they fuse with, or separate from, the plasma membrane. Such observations will detect the mechanical forces accompanying membrane fusion and fission, and their relationship to the proteins that may cause them.As a physiologist, I have studied exocytosis and endocytosis, two processes fundamental to every cell.

VIn my research on viral hepatitis and the safety of the blood supply, I have determined the incidence of transfusion-associated hepatitis, identified risk factors in the donor population that contribute to hepatitis transmission, and designed preventive strategies. These studies have led to adoption of an all-volunteer donor supply, the early use of hepatitis B virus screening, the identification of non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH), the use of surrogate markers (ALT, anti-HBc) to prevent NANBH transmission and proof that the cloned hepatitis C virus was the predominant cause of NANBH. These studies have contributed to a decline in hepatitis incidence from 30 percent in 1970 to near zero in 2000. These prospective studies are now focused on other infectious agents that can be blood transmitted, such as CMV, parvovirus B-19, and West Nile virus. Another interest has been in the history of hepatitis C virus infection and the virologic and immune mechanisms that lead to viral persistence. It appears that 20 percent of hepatitis-C-infected individuals clear the initial infection but that 80 percent have a virus-specific immune deficit that is insufficient to clear a virus that exists as a swarm of immunologically distinct variants (quasi species). Studies of the viral quasi species and cell-mediated immunity to the hepatitis C virus are vital to devising vaccine strategies. I am working on a DNA vaccine approach using lipid adjuvants and a recombinant protein boost.In my research on viral hepatitis and the safety of the blood supply, I have determined the incidence of transfusion-associated hepatitis, identified risk factors in the donor population that contribute to hepatitis transmission, and designed preventive strategies.

VAs a behavioral ecologist with focus on long-lived and highly social mammals, I concentrate on the reciprocal relationships between variability in behavior and ecology on the one hand and variability in survival and reproduction on the other, within natural populations.  Consequently, one major research effort has been development of widely applicable non-invasive and non-manipulative techniques for data collection and the use of such data.  We have recently extended this effort from behavior and demography to DNA and steroid hormones, enabling us to 'get under the skin' without disturbing either behavior or sensitive physiological processes.  Our empirical research, conducted in close collaboration with US and Kenyan associates, involves almost daily data collection on the Amboseli population of baboons-large primates that share many traits with humans and that are increasingly a model species for large mammal integrative biology.  Our database is now three-decades and six-generations deep. Finding from several recent studies include that fathers in this highly polygynandrous species exhibit true paternal care, that variability in females' sociality predicts survival of their infants, and that differences in energetic balance result primarily from differences in activity, not in nutrient intake, and result in physiological differences that in humans predict morbidity and mortality.As a behavioral ecologist with focus on long-lived and highly social mammals, I concentrate on the reciprocal relationships between variability in behavior and ecology on the one hand and variability in survival and reproduction on the other, within natural populations.

VMy scientific interests are mostly in the field of quantum theory of condensed matter physics. For a long while I worked to improve the theoretical understanding of the effects of disorder and interactions between electrons on the properties of bulk and low-dimensional and finite-size conductors. Although a number of physical phenomena were predicted and understood as an interplay between the interaction of quantum particles with an external potential and with one another, there is still a lot to understand theoretically. We still have to substantially improve our description of the destruction of the phase coherence in disordered conductors by electron-electron interactions and the effects of disorder on strongly correlated electronic systems. Recently I have been working on the theory of nonequilibrium and metastable states of quantum systems. From a more general perspective I am interested in the fields that are connected with the interaction and disorder in quantum systems: quantum chaos, nanoscience, quantum field theory, and quantum information.My scientific interests are mostly in the field of quantum theory of condensed matter physics.

VResearch in our laboratory focuses on neurotransmitter transporters, the plasma membrane proteins that limit the actions of neurotransmitters following their release from neurons. These carrier proteins catalyze the inward movement of neurotransmitter molecules and have a profound impact on the extent of receptor activation that occurs during neuronal signaling. We have also shown that these transporters can possess a substrate-dependent ion channel-like activity, a property that allows them to regulate neuronal excitability and serve as sensors of extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations. Neurotransmitter transporters are also well-established targets for addictive drugs, including cocaine and amphetamines, for the class of therapeutic antidepressants known as reuptake inhibitors, and for methylphenidate, which is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. Our major efforts use molecular genetic, electrophysiological and cell biological approaches to explore the relationships between neurotransmitter transporter structure, substrate transport, drug action and ion permeation.Research in our laboratory focuses on neurotransmitter transporters, the plasma membrane proteins that limit the actions of neurotransmitters following their release from neurons.

VMy research focus has been the regulation of plant development, particularly the transition to flowering. Many plant species have evolved the ability to regulate flowering in response to environmental cues such as changes in day-length or temperature. For example, certain plant species do not initiate flowering unless they have experienced the prolonged cold of winter. This promotion of flowering by prolonged exposure to cold is known as vernalization. A vernalization requirement ensures that in temperate regions flowering does not occur in the fall season.  Our studies of floral induction in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed a gene, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) that plays a key role in establishing a vernalization requirement. FLC encodes a potent repressor of flowering that is active in autumn. During winter, vernalization causes FLC repression which, in turn, results in the acquisition of competence to flower in the spring. The repression of FLC by vernalization is epigenetic in the sense that it is mitotically stable in the absence of the inducing signal, cold exposure.  In the next generation, FLC is reset to the expressed state. We have shown that the different epigenetic states of FLC expression in fall, winter and spring are associated with a series of modifications to FLC chromatin, and we have characterized many of the components that are required to establish these distinct states of FLC expression. For example, the cold-mediated repression is initiated by a gene, VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3) that has the unique property of being expressed only after prolonged exposure to cold. Most organisms can sense cold, but plants have evolved the additional ability to "count", at a cellular level, the number of days they have exposed to cold, and VIN3 induction during winter is an output of this cold measurement system.My research focus has been the regulation of plant development, particularly the transition to flowering.

VI am primarily a developmental biologist, interested is the genetic regulatory mechanisms that control animal development, and in particular the molecules that function during animal development to ensure the proper timing of developmental events. I have primarily employed the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system for studying the function of regulators of developmental timing, which in C. elegans are known as the "heterochronic genes", in reference to the remarkable changes in relative timing of developmental event that are elicited by mutations in these genes. The heterochronic genes comprise a set of interrelated regulatory pathways that include proteins that regulate the transcription of other genes, and also a class of small RNA, known as microRNAs, that regulate the production of protein by the messenger RNAs of specific target genes. Much of my research in recent years has been aimed at understanding how microRNAs are integrated into broader regulatory networks related to animal development and human disease, and at uncovering the molecular mechanisms for how microRNAs exert their effects on gene expression.I am primarily a developmental biologist, interested is the genetic regulatory mechanisms that control animal development, and in particular the molecules that function during animal development to ensure the proper timing of developmental events.

VResearch interests in my laboratory focus on using molecular genetic techniques to map neural circuits for innate behaviors, in both flies and mice. In mice, our primary focus is on neural circuits underlying fear, anxiety and pain. We are using genes expressed in subsets of neurons within the amygdala, a structure implicated in fear, to genetically silence and activate these neurons, as well as to trace their connectivity. A similar approach is being applied to studying the function of subsets of nociceptive primary sensory neurons. We are also collaborating with the laboratory of Henry Lester to develop techniques for reversible genetic neuronal silencing in mice. Our research in flies is focused on applying analogous approaches to dissecting the neural circuitry underlying simple "models" of innate olfactory avoidance behavior, agitation/arousal and "behavioral inhibition," a correlate of anxiety in mammalian species.Research interests in my laboratory focus on using molecular genetic techniques to map neural circuits for innate behaviors, in both flies and mice.

We are using genes expressed in subsets of neurons within the amygdala, a structure implicated in fear, to genetically silence and activate these neurons, as well as to trace their connectivity. A similar approach is being applied to studying the function of subsets of nociceptive primary sensory neurons. We are also collaborating with the laboratory of Henry Lester to develop techniques for reversible genetic neuronal silencing in mice.

VI am interested in understanding how the body plans of animals are established during development. We have used a combination of genetics and microinjection of RNAs and proteins to identify and characterize the proteins that direct axis determination and cell-type specification. Much of my career has focused on understanding the establishment of asymmetry in the early Drosophila embryo. We found that the Toll gene encodes a transmembrane protein that controls dorsal-ventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo. Toll is activated only on the ventral side of the embryo as a consequence of localized proteolytic processing of its ligand, the Spatzle protein. Localized processing of Spatzle in turn depends on the activity of a series of extracellular serine proteases. The Toll pathway has an evolutionary conserved function in innate immune responses, although apparently not in early development. We have used Drosophila genetics to identify more of the genes that are important in innate responses to infection.  Recently we have applied classical genetic approaches to the early development of the mouse embryo. We have identified genes that control early neural and mesodermal patterning and are working to define genetic pathways that specify the mammalian body plan.I am interested in understanding how the body plans of animals are established during development.

VI am interested in whether there are Earth-like planets of other stars and if these have life. While this has been a topic of speculation for thousands of years, only now is the technology becoming available to undertake astronomical observations with enough sensitivity. Neville Woolf and I realized that cold telescopes in space could potentially resolve the thermal emission of terrestrial planets and that greenhouse gases could be detected in relatively crude spectra. We would hope to detect in another planet the strong water and ozone features that in Earth's spectrum are indicators of oceans and life. The kind of telescope needed to make these observations combines the light from several large, lightweight mirrors in space, destructively interfering the stellar emission to reveal the much fainter planet. While such a telescope, first proposed by Ron Bracewell, is still more than a decade off, we have now demonstrated the technique with ground telescopes and will soon use it to study Jupiter-like exoplanets with the large binocular telescope. An even bigger ground-based interferometer now on the drawing boards, combining two 20-m telescopes, could make the first detection of Earth-like planets if they are commonly present around stars like the Sun.I am interested in whether there are Earth-like planets of other stars and if these have life.

VI study methods for the analysis of geospatial data. I have developed new statistical and data visualization techniques, disseminated them in the form of software tools and applied them in a range of empirical settings in the environmental and social sciences, dealing with topics such as the effect of environmental quality on house prices, the spatial distribution of homicides, spatial models of international conflict, and the diffusion of university-generated knowledge. Specifically, I laid out a framework for a field of spatial econometrics, stressing the importance of the concepts of spatial dependence (how observations in nearby locations tend to be similar) and spatial heterogeneity (how processes differentiate themselves across space), and how these are reflected in model specification, estimation of parameters, and diagnostic tests for model performance. I also work in exploratory spatial data analysis, by developing new graphical techniques to visualize and explore spatial autocorrelation, especially in conjunction with the technology of geographic information systems. In my earlier work, I introduced the notion of local indicators of spatial autocorrelation, which allow the detection of hot spots and spatial outliers, and which have found wide application in several scientific fields.

VI study how biological systems evolve at the molecular level and use that insight to create new ones. Evolution works at all scales of complexity, from proteins to ecosystems; we have developed new ways to direct evolution to particular goals by controlling how and where mutations are made and using artificial selection. My laboratory uses evolutionary approaches to create new biological entities because these approaches circumvent our profound ignorance of how DNA sequence encodes biological function and exploit the remarkable ability of biological systems to evolve and adapt. With directed evolution we recreate or anticipate possible routes of natural evolution and explore what is physically possible versus what is merely biologically relevant at the time. These experiments have helped us to construct new biological molecules, organisms, and even synthetic microbial ecosystems.I study how biological systems evolve at the molecular level and use that insight to create new ones.

VAs a palaeoanthropologist I am mainly concerned with the fossil evidence for human evolution. My research has focused on the Atapuerca sites, a series of caves located in a hill in northern Spain with a fossil record that spans from more than a million years ago up to the Bronze Age. In the Lower Pleistocene levels at the Gran Dolina site some 80 hominid fossils have been discovered. Dating to around 800,000 years ago, they represent some of the oldest human fossils in Europe. Our analysis of these remains has led us to define a new species of hominid, Homo antecessor, which represents the last common ancestor of the Neanderthal and modern human lineages. The human remains from this site also represent the earliest evidence of cannibalistic practices in the fossil record. The Middle Pleistocene site of the Sima de los Huesos has yielded more than 3,000 hominid remains dated to between 350,000-400,000 years ago and representing at least 28 individuals. These hominids represent an early ancestor of the Neanderthals. Together with the human fossils a single hand axe has been recovered, leading us to believe that the site represents the earliest evidence of both funerary practice and symbolic behavior.As a palaeoanthropologist I am mainly concerned with the fossil evidence for human evolution.

VMy successive research interests have all been related to my fascination with "quantum weirdness," revealed in the experiments in Photon Optics and Atom Optics that I have carried out with outstanding collaborators. Some of the observed effects might eventually lead to practical applications. In the early 1980's, we produced pairs of entangled photons to perform experimental tests of the famous Bell's inequalities, helping to settle a debate between Einstein and Bohr about the conceptual foundations of Quantum Mechanics. Later, a source of single photons allowed us to demonstrate the surprising behavior of such light on a beam splitter. Entangled photons and single photons are now widely used in the rapidly developing field of quantum information. In the late 1980's, in the team led by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, we developed a method based on a quantum interference effect to cool atoms below the so-called "single photon recoil limit," very close to absolute zero. Since 1992 my research group on Atom Optics has aimed at exploring with atoms phenomenon previously observed with photons, with possible applications to inertial and gravitational sensors based on atom interferometers. Most of our experiments use Bose Einstein Condensates of dilute atom gases, in particular BEC's of metastable Helium. We have demonstrated several Quantum Atom Optics effects (atomic Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect;  production of correlated atom pairs), which can be even more surprising than their Photon Optics analogues, since atoms can come either as bosons or as fermions. Another promising line of research aims at using ultra-cold atoms to build quantum simulators for shedding new light on condensed matter problems, for example, Anderson localization of matter waves in a disordered medium.My successive research interests have all been related to my fascination with "quantum weirdness," revealed in the experiments in Photon Optics and Atom Optics that I have carried out with outstanding collaborators.

VHaving used geology as a long-term advisory of earthquakes and tsunamis in the Cascadia region of western North American, I now try to make this strategy helpful to developing countries. I seek to mentor their scientists in assessing tsunami hazards on the centennial and millennial timescales of great-earthquake recurrence. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami prompted a two-year USAID program that allowed me to attempt such mentoring. In 2006 I led unsuccessful hunts for ancient tsunami deposits at Sunda Strait, southern Java, the Khao Lak area of Thailand, India's Bay of Bengal coast south of Chennai, and India's Arabian Sea coast facing the Makran subduction zone. Officially a trainer, I was being trained by rice paddies, crab-riddled mangroves, and logistics of South and Southeast Asia. The year 2007, however, brought paleotsunami discoveries by Thai and Indonesian scientists who learned with me from these failures. In 2008 I expect to remain involved in earthquake and tsunami geology at Cascadia and on Indian Ocean shores. I also plan to explore earthquake geology in the Dominican Republic, in hopes of guiding the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on tsunami hazards of the U.S. Atlantic coast.Having used geology as a long-term advisory of earthquakes and tsunamis in the Cascadia region of western North American, I now try to make this strategy helpful to developing countries.

VOur research focuses on developing new experimental techniques aimed at exploring the dynamics of electron, nuclear, and magnetic spins within a variety of atomically engineered nanostructures. The measurements help form the basis for semiconductor spintronics and future quantum information processing technologies. We combine femtosecond optical spectroscopies with low temperature magneto-optical and magnetoelectronic transport techniques in order to perform experiments with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our activities focus on three scientific areas, including (1) Spin dynamics and coherence in the solid state. Here, time-resolved optical experiments are designed to create, transport, and manipulate charge and spin coherences in solid state structures. In particular, we investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of electronic, magnetic, and nuclear spins in three-dimensional and quantum-confined semiconductor nanostructures, yielding information on spin scattering, quantization, and tunneling as well as demonstrating coherent spin manipulation by both optical and electrical means; (2) Magnetic semiconductors.

In particular, we investigate the spatio-temporal evolution of electronic, magnetic, and nuclear spins in three-dimensional and quantum-confined semiconductor nanostructures, yielding information on spin scattering, quantization, and tunneling as well as demonstrating coherent spin manipulation by both optical and electrical means; (2) Magnetic semiconductors.

VAll cells contain ATP-dependent protein unfoldases that function in protein-quality control and in many regulatory circuits. These protein machines promote ATP-dependent protein degradation and also disassemble stable protein complexes and aggregates. My recent work has focused on determining strategies of substrate recognition and the mechanism of protein unfolding used by the Clp/Hsp100 family of unfoldases, with major emphasis on the bacterial ClpX unfoldase. These studies reveal general principles that underlie both constitutive and regulated substrate recognition. Some substrates are recognized directly, generally via short sequence tags near the termini of the protein that serve as a binding handle for the enzyme. Other proteins are recognized in a regulated manner. Latent recognition tags can become accessible to the enzyme following protein cleavage, protein unfolding, or rearrangement of subunit interfaces. Adaptor proteins, which interact with both the unfoldase and the substrate, provide another mechanism for controlling substrate choice. We are currently studying the structure, function, and regulation of several different adaptor proteins and are investigating the mechanism of protein unfolding and how ATP hydrolysis is used to fuel the protein unfolding/translocation cycle.All cells contain ATP-dependent protein unfoldases that function in protein-quality control and in many regulatory circuits.

VI have excavated a wide range of sites that have contributed to answering questions about the important steps in human cultural evolution: Israel, Sinai (Egypt), Turkey, Czech Republic, Republic of Georgia, and the People's Republic of China. My early work added evidence for the first "out of Africa" human dispersals, represented at the site of 'Ubeidiya in the Jordan Valley. As co-director of a large Israeli-French-U.S. research program, I spent two decades of field and laboratory research in Kebara, Qafzeh, and Hayonim caves in Israel demonstrating the early arrival of modern humans and the surprising late appearance of Neanderthals. This cooperative study opened the way to a better understanding of the cultural emergence of early modern foragers across Eurasia who are considered the bearers of the "creative explosion." I have also investigated the material remains of the latest hunter-gatherers in the southern Levant, known as the Natufian culture, and one of the first Neolithic communities of cereal cultivators in the Jordan Valley. I am currently involved in continuing field programs in both southeast Turkey and southern China, which are designed to identify cultural and economic processes in these major centers of the Neolithic Revolution.I have excavated a wide range of sites that have contributed to answering questions about the important steps in human cultural evolution: Israel, Sinai (Egypt), Turkey, Czech Republic, Republic of Georgia, and the People's Republic of China.

VMy lab asks how an animal's genes and neural circuits allow it to generate appropriate behavioral responses to the environment. We study the compact nervous system of the nematode C. elegans using genetic, developmental, and behavioral approaches. C. elegans has a rich sense of smell, and innate preferences for certain odors. By studying a mutant that could not respond to the buttery odor diacetyl, we identified the receptor protein that detects this odor. Much of odor discrimination is specified by the interaction of specific receptors with their odorant ligands. Each odorant receptor is expressed in a few olfactory neurons. Activation of a particular olfactory neuron drives a stereotyped behavior, so that the animal knows which behavior to generate by determining which olfactory neuron has been activated. Each neuron has characteristic synaptic connections with other cells. We have identified cells and molecules that act as developmental guideposts for some neuronal connections. Genetic variation in natural populations contributes to the behavioral differences between individuals in a species. Natural C. elegans isolates can exhibit either solitary or social feeding behaviors. Remarkably, a single amino acid change in a neuronal neuropeptide receptor is responsible for much of the natural variation in this behavior.My lab asks how an animal's genes and neural circuits allow it to generate appropriate behavioral responses to the environment.

VMy research interests are in both particle physics and gravitation. In particle physics my colleagues and I developed a large underground project at the MACRO experiment at Gran Sasso, Italy, to search for very heavy magnetic monopoles predicted in grand unified theories, and to probe a variety of other problems in the emerging area of particle astrophysics. MACRO provided some of the key evidence that neutrinos have mass and undergo neutrino oscillations. I am continuing to pursue that phenomenon in a long baseline experiment (MINOS), which will use a neutrino beam originating at Fermilab and transversing the 730 km to the Soudan mine in Minnesota where the detector is located. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is being developed with observatories in Washington State and Louisiana that will be used for the detection and study of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources. The detectors are precision suspended mass laser interferometers that monitor motions of test masses separated by four kilometer baselines and will be used in coincidence.

VAs a chemist I am interested in nucleic acid structure and reactions, using transition metal complexes as probes. We have designed octahedral metallointercalators and demonstrated enantioselective binding of the small cations to DNA. Rhodium complexes were made that bind avidly and with photoactivation cleave DNA. Ruthenium complexes were prepared as sensitive luminescent probes. Complexes were designed that recognize different DNA sites with high specificity. With these tools I began studies of DNA electron transfer. Stacked DNA base pairs resemble solid-state p-stacked materials. We asked whether DNA as a molecular p-stack could also provide a facile medium to transport charge. DNA assemblies with pendant electron donors and acceptors were constructed and, using spectroscopic and biochemical methods, DNA electron transfer was examined. We learned that this chemistry was exquisitely sensitive to stacking within the helix, and we developed electrochemistry to detect single base mismatches in DNA and to monitor protein/DNA interactions. Long-range charge transport can also be harnessed to carry out chemical reactions at a distance. DNA oxidation can occur through charge transport 20 nanometers from the bound oxidant, and long-range oxidative DNA damage has been seen within the cell nucleus. We are exploring the biological consequences and opportunities for this chemistry.As a chemist I am interested in nucleic acid structure and reactions, using transition metal complexes as probes.

VWe do not all live in the same taste worlds. Some (supertasters) live in a neon world where tastes may be so strong they are disliked. This affects diet which, in turn, affects risk factors for a variety of diseases (e.g., avoidance of bitter vegetables may lead to increased cancer risk; avoidance of high fat foods may lead to decreased cardiovascular risk). Anatomical links between taste and oral pain (taste buds are surrounded by fibers mediating pain) put supertasters at risk for some oral pain disorders (e.g., burning mouth syndrome). Bartoshuk and her students study the links between oral sensation and behavior in normal subjects as well as patients suffering from taste/oral pain disorders. Since we cannot share experiences, comparisons of sensations across subject/groups must be made indirectly, often with labeled scales. For example, we might assess pain with a 10-point scale labeled "no pain" at one end and "worst pain ever" at the other. Although widely used, such scales provide erroneous comparisons because "worst pain ever" varies across patients. Bartoshuk and her students work on methods that can provide valid comparisons.We do not all live in the same taste worlds.

VI investigate mechanisms of cell-to-cell communication in bacteria. This process, called quorum sensing, involves the production, release, and subsequent detection of chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to synchronize behaviors and thereby function as multi-cellular organisms. Processes controlled by quorum sensing are usually ones that are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium but become effective when undertaken by the group. For example, quorum sensing controls bioluminescence, secretion of virulence factors, biofilm formation, sporulation, and the exchange of DNA. Using the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi and the related pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae as models, we have shown that bacteria make, detect, and integrate information from multiple autoinducers, some of which are used exclusively for intra-species communication while one, called AI-2, appears to be a universal signal enabling inter-species communication. Our recent studies combining genetics and bioinformatics show that multiple small regulatory RNAs act at the core of quorum-sensing cascades, and function as ultrasensitive regulatory switches controlling the transition into and out of quorum-sensing mode. Currently, we are developing therapies that interfere with quorum sensing to control bacterial virulence. Specifically, AI-2 and its detection apparatus are promising targets for novel broad-spectrum anti-microbial drug design.I investigate mechanisms of cell-to-cell communication in bacteria.

Processes controlled by quorum sensing are usually ones that are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium but become effective when undertaken by the group. For example, quorum sensing controls bioluminescence, secretion of virulence factors, biofilm formation, sporulation, and the exchange of DNA. Using the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi and the related pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae as models, we have shown that bacteria make, detect, and integrate information from multiple autoinducers, some of which are used exclusively for intra-species communication while one, called AI-2, appears to be a universal signal enabling inter-species communication. Our recent studies combining genetics and bioinformatics show that multiple small regulatory RNAs act at the core of quorum-sensing cascades, and function as ultrasensitive regulatory switches controlling the transition into and out of quorum-sensing mode. Currently, we are developing therapies that interfere with quorum sensing to control bacterial virulence. Specifically, AI-2 and its detection apparatus are promising targets for novel broad-spectrum anti-microbial drug design.

VMy laboratory focuses on the science and applications of nanocrystals, especially semiconductor nanocrystals (aka quantum dots). Our research ranges from the very fundamental to applications in electro-optics and biology. There is an ongoing synthetic effort to address the challenges of making new compositions and morphologies of nanocrystals, novel nanocrystal heterostructures, and new ligands so that the nanocrystals can be incorporated into hybrid organic/inorganic devices, or biological systems. The fundamental spectroscopic focus is currently largely at the single quantum dot level, where we are developing methods for probing the dynamical properties of the electronic electronic excitations in quantum dots at time scales between 100 psec and 1 msec. We are also investigating the physics of multiexcitons in various quantum dots using both ensemble time resolved methods, as well as single quantum dot photon correlation spectroscopies. We are studying the charge transport properties of films of dots or dot/organic and dot/inorganic hybrids, within our group and with collaborators. These fundamental transport properties are critical for designing devices such as electrically driven quantum dot based light emitters, lasers, photodetectors and photovoltaics. We are also collaborating with biology and biomedical groups to design nanocrystal probes that meet specific challenges. These include nanocrystals that selectively bind to single receptors on cell surfaces for tracking applications, creating "smart" nanocrystals that sense analytes to report back on concentrations of species, and systematic characterizations of the effect of size, morphology, charge, and other surface compositions, on the uptake (or clearance) of nanocrystals for potential in vivo applications.My laboratory focuses on the science and applications of nanocrystals, especially semiconductor nanocrystals (aka quantum dots).

VMy research has been primarily on the development and application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for studying the structure and dynamics of proteins. Our so-called triple resonance approach relies on uniform 13C and 15N enrichment of proteins, and utilizes through-bond J couplings to assign the various resonances. By extending the original concept of two-dimensional NMR to three and even four dimensions, the resonance overlap problem was greatly reduced, thereby significantly increasing the size of proteins accessible by NMR. Further extension of this limit became feasible when we combined perdeuteration of the non-exchangeable hydrogens with the triple resonance concept. The incorporation of stable 15N and 13C isotopes into proteins also permitted us to develop straightforward ways for the quantitative study of protein backbone dynamics. Much of this early work was on the regulatory protein calmodulin and on the relative mobility of its two domains. More recently, after I succeeded in aligning proteins in dilute liquid crystalline suspensions, we were able to measure dipole-dipole couplings that define orientations of bond vectors relative to a common reference frame. This not only provides a unique structure validation tool but also can increase dramatically the global accuracy of NMR structures. My current interest focuses on the use of dipolar couplings to further accelerate the structure determination process and to extend NMR to lipophilic proteins.My research has been primarily on the development and application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for studying the structure and dynamics of proteins.

VWorking first as a structural engineer, I became skeptical of the codified empirical design procedures guarding against quasi-brittle structural failure preceded by distributed cracking and stable fracture growth. The inherent size effects on structural strength were generally attributed to material randomness. My assistants and I demonstrated that this disagreed with experiments. I realized that these effects are caused by stress redistributions and stored energy release, and can be easily captured by asymptotic matching. This led me to a simple size-effect law of surprisingly broad applicability, bridging the power scaling laws of classical fracture mechanics and plasticity. We experimentally verified this law for concrete, rocks, sea ice, fiber composites, toughened ceramics, foams, and snow slabs, and showed its use for identifying cohesive fracture characteristics from experiments. Computer simulation of size effects with nonlocal damage and crack-band models avoiding spurious damage localization and mesh sensitivity followed, so have ramifications to compression fracture, kink bands in fiber composites, extreme value statistics of quasi-brittle failure initiation, microplane models, and micromechanical theory of nonlocality. Currently I am exploring asymptotic techniques for nanoscale, and I continue my long-time researches in creep and hygrothermal effects in concrete, inelastic stability, finite strain, constitutive laws, and probabilistic mechanics.Working first as a structural engineer, I became skeptical of the codified empirical design procedures guarding against quasi-brittle structural failure preceded by distributed cracking and stable fracture growth.

VThe aim of my research is to understand the molecular mechanisms that organize the growth of multicellular embryos. My work in recent years has focused on the Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted signaling proteins. These proteins are expressed in restricted embryonic locations and elicit graded responses in surrounding cells, thereby controlling the patterns of cellular proliferation and differentiation in developing organs, such as the brain and spinal cord, the limbs, the axial skeleton and musculature, and in the gastrointestinal tract and its derivatives, such as the lungs. In addition to helping define such biological activities, our studies have concentrated on the mechanisms by which Hh proteins are modified by cholesterol and palmitate, two distinct lipid adducts that influence the activity of the mature Hh signal. Our current work is aimed at understanding how the distribution of this signal is regulated in tissues, how cells perceive and respond to distinct concentrations of this signal, how this and related signaling pathways that pattern multicellular embryos arose in evolution, and how activity of such pathways contributes to growth of a variety of tumors.The aim of my research is to understand the molecular mechanisms that organize the growth of multicellular embryos.

VI am interested in the structures and reactions of organic compounds with an initial focus on matters which do not fit conventional wisdom. By spectroscopic and calorimetric studies we determined that the relative energies of functional groups which are protomeric or alkymeric isomers can be greatly affected by the molecular environment and provided a phenomenological model for the effect. In studies of reactions of organolithium compounds, we investigated thiophillic additions, delineated functional group directed remote lithiations, and established the intermediacy of dipole stabilized carbanions. This class of carbanions have been developed to be useful in synthesis and used to elucidate the role of pre-equilibrium complexes as a model for novel reactions in organolithium chemistry. In studies of asymmetric synthesis using these species, we differentiated the roles of asymmetric deprotonation and asymmetric substitution in controlling the course of reactions and developed diastereomeric equilibration as a procedure for significantly improving enantiomeric ratios. Our investigations of transition structures in displacement reactions by organolithium compounds led to the development of endocyclic reactions as strategy which reveals the geometry of substitutions at nonstereogenic atoms. This approach has proven useful more broadly for evaluating reaction trajectories.I am interested in the structures and reactions of organic compounds with an initial focus on matters which do not fit conventional wisdom.

VAs an epidemiologist I have concentrated on the epidemic and evolutionary potential of arthropod-borne viruses--such as dengue, yellow fever, and the mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses--and of certain rodent-borne viruses. Major research endeavors include developing rapid, clinically relevant diagnostic and surveillance techniques for arbovirus infections in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts; defining vector and viral genetic and molecular determinants of arbovirus transmission, transeasonality, and trafficking; describing vector and virus genetic determinants of the epidemic potential of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Mexico; creating arbovirus expression systems to characterize genes of interest in vectors; and investigating and demonstrating the evolutionary potential of arboviruses in vectors. I have recently investigated the molecular biology and population genetics of insect vectors of pathogens to develop novel strategies for control of these important diseases. The principal emphases are developing molecular mechanisms to transform mosquito vectors, engineering novel pathogen-resistant vector phenotypes, and developing drive mechanisms to drive anti-pathogen effector systems through vector populations.As an epidemiologist I have concentrated on the epidemic and evolutionary potential of arthropod-borne viruses--such as dengue, yellow fever, and the mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses--and of certain rodent-borne viruses.

VA geographer by training, I have an abiding interest in the Andean-Amazonian region of South America: the region has been my second home and a site in which I have pursued my research interests in the factors that drive the relationships between humans and the environment under conditions of inequality and poverty.   My early work on indigenous agricultural systems identified the importance of local organizational forms and institutions in determining patterns of technological change and land use.  While that work was at a community scale, our subsequent work suggested that meso-scale patterns of agrarian change were influenced by the nature and quality of relationships between state and civil society organizations (especially producer organizations, social movements and nongovernmental organizations).  This suggested important policy levers for intervening in human-environmental relations.  My recent work considers human-environment relationships when natural resource based growth (mining, oil, gas etc.), precedes institutional innovation to regulate this resource extraction.  This research suggests that, even under such adverse circumstances sustainability enhancing institutions can be created. One condition for this is the presence of social conflict that leads to demands for institutional change; the other is the presence of actors that can translate this conflict into specific institutional innovations. Conflict, adequately brokered, can offset asymmetries of power and allow institutional change. Even in conflictive situations, institutions that allow local ownership can progress and be more effective than centrally imposed institutions that are mostly designed to foster economic growth.A geographer by training, I have an abiding interest in the Andean-Amazonian region of South America: the region has been my second home and a site in which I have pursued my research interests in the factors that drive the relationships between humans and the environment under conditions of inequality and poverty.

Our work www.MyLifeBis.com extends the vision of a Memex posited by Vannevar Bush in 1945. In effect Memex is a system quest for a transaction processing SQL database that can record everything a person sees and hears. It is predicated on the evolving sensing and storage capabilities enabling a lifetime digital store. By having all of a person's transactions with time and other meta-data, the value of the content for retrieval is increased by being able to relate items for retrieval and understanding - in effect, creating a faithful and perfect surrogate memory. A by-product allows for a digital immortality. I am generally interested in technology history as a founder and trustee of the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, CA.

My interest in scientific computing continues e.g. as a member of the Dept of Energy's Advanced Scientific Advisory Committee (ASCAC) and the introduction of use of databases for communities that were pioneered my colleague Jim Gray.

VMy research is focused on the biological foundations of language and other cognitive functions as well as their genetic basis.  Research projects include studies of Language, Modality and the Brain; Brain Organization: Clues form Sign Aphasia; Williams Syndrome: Bridging Cognition Brain and Gene, and The Neural and Genetics Bases of Social Behavior. I have co-authored hundreds of papers and several books including The Signs of Language (which won an award from the Association of American Publishers); What the Hands Reveal About the Brain; Linking Cognitive, Brain and Molecular Genetics. I have organized symposia on Neurobiology: Brain and Cognitive Development; Cognition, Brain, and Gene; Genetics Syndromes of Contrasting Cognitive Profiles. Taken together, these studies permit the exploration of some of the central issues of cognitive neuroscience linking cognitive functions with their bases in neurobiology and gene expression.My research is focused on the biological foundations of language and other cognitive functions as well as their genetic basis.

VMy research is in the areas of climate and biogeochemistry. For the last two decades my colleagues and I have measured variations in the concentration of oxygen and its isotopic composition to characterize rates of photosynthesis and respiration at different scales of time and space. We have made our measurements in the modern atmosphere, in air in the snowpack of polar ice sheets, in seawater-dissolved gases, and in fossil air samples trapped in ice cores. Our atmospheric measurements have characterized the fertility of the oceans and, together with snowpack studies, constrained rates of fossil fuel carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and the land biosphere during recent decades. Seawater measurements have characterized regional rates of photosynthesis and respiration in the oceans. Ice core measurements constrain glacial-interglacial changes in the fertility of Earth's marine and land biospheres. They also provide a means for correlating ice cores, yielding information about the timing (and hence dynamics) of large-scale climate changes.My research is in the areas of climate and biogeochemistry.

VFrom my earliest training in genetics and molecular biology, I have been interested in the organization, evolution and function of eukaryotic genomes. My laboratory has concentrated on the roles of transposable elements in rearranging chromosomes and altering gene function. We've isolated many novel transposable elements from maize (commonly known as corn in the United States) and several related cereal species, and have characterized the mutational mechanisms and regulation of these mobile DNAs. These studies also led to our development of comparative genomics as a major tool for cereal study, producing the first data showing an exceptional level of micro-instability in plant chromosomes within a framework of overall genome macro-conservation. One result of these observations has been a mechanistic explanation of the "C-value paradox", the huge variation in genome size that does not correlate with organismal complexity. A second outcome has been the development of comparative genomics as a uniquely valuable tool for the study and improvement of grain species, like the millets and sorghum, that receive little research attention because they are not major sources of food or income in the Western world. We have used comparative genetic mapping, cloning and sequencing to identify genes and germplasm in these "orphan crops" that could be used to greatly enhance crops yields and maintain agricultural diversity in the developing world.From my earliest training in genetics and molecular biology, I have been interested in the organization, evolution and function of eukaryotic genomes.

VMy research has primarily been in the areas of Bayesian statistics, statistical decision theory, foundations of statistics, and various interdisciplinary areas of science and industry. The work in Bayesian statistics has focused on developing objective Bayesian methodology, most lately for selection among statistical models and for hypothesis testing. A significant motivator of the latter work is the need to have alternatives to `p-values,' which are arguably the most misused tools in science. My interest in the foundations of statistics is based on the perhaps surprising fact that the statistics profession is still in the midst of a major debate as to what foundational approach is best; my own view is that the foundations of statistics should primarily be Bayesian, but with a strong component of frequentist statistics - the currently dominant approach. I also focus on developing statistical procedures that are simultaneously interpretable from all foundational perspectives. My work in statistical decision theory has concentrated on discovering optimal statistical procedures in decision-theoretic settings, most lately when prediction is of primary interest. My interdisciplinary work has most recently focused on research in various astronomical problems and on the endemic problem of evaluating and appropriately utilizing complex computer models of physical processes in nature and engineering.My research has primarily been in the areas of Bayesian statistics, statistical decision theory, foundations of statistics, and various interdisciplinary areas of science and industry.

VFrom the time that I was a child, I was attracted to Relativity, Einstein's intuition, and Physics in general. I stumbled into AMO as a graduate student and was fortunate enough to study the art and science of laser physics with Noble Prize winner, Dr. John Hall. A National Research Council Fellowship, under the tutelage of Dr. Dave Wineland, brought me into the world of laser-cooling of single (and multiple), trapped ions for the pursuit of high resolution spectroscopy and metrology. I have never left this beautiful field of physics. Together with a host of visiting scientists as well as the other ion storage members--Wayne Itano, John Bollinger, Didi Leibfried and Till Rosenband, we have pursued high resolution metrology to the 18th decimal place. Our resolution permits meaningful earth-based laboratory studies of relativity as well as other tests of fundamental physics, which (in some cases) has negated the need of expensive and risky launches into outer space.

VI am working in several different though interrelated areas of Mathematics. One of my main areas of interest is the representation theory in a broad sense. This includes representations of real and p-adic groups, representations of Lie algebras and quantum groups. During the last 15 years I am also working on closely related theory of automorphic forms. Another area of my interests is algebraic geometry with emphasize on D-modules, l-adic sheaves and so on. Closely related to this is the theory of equivariant sheaves which for me is closely related to representation theory. There are two very large areas closely connected to the areas listed above - number theory and high-energy physics. I am very much interested in these areas but can not consider myself to be an expert in them.I am working in several different though interrelated areas of Mathematics.

VThe immune system is well known for its ability to discriminate self from non-self. Innate perception of non-self depends upon receptors encoded in the germ line. My research has been directed toward the identification of these receptors and understanding their mode of action. By positional cloning, my colleagues and I discovered the principal sensors that alert the immune system to infection by gram negative bacteria. We identified Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as the signaling core of the receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide. It proved to be a member of a family of proteins, which act in concert to detect most microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, triggering a powerful inflammatory response. Receptors of the same family also appear to mediate sterile inflammation and autoimmunity. We have used random germline mutagenesis to dissect the molecular pathways through which TLRs signal, and looking more broadly, have sought to identify all proteins with defined importance in host immune defense. This we pursue by positionally cloning chemically-induced mutations that produce immunologically abnormal phenotypes in mice. The essential proteins we have identified include sensing, signaling, effector, and homeostatic proteins (that permit us to survive our own immune response); also proteins specifically required for ontogeny of immune cells.The immune system is well known for its ability to discriminate self from non-self.

VAs a cellular immunologist I study the development of T lymphocytes in the thymus and the response of mature T cells to pathogens. The focus of study is the subset of T cells that bear the CD8 marker and that can kill infected cells expressing their target antigen, so-called cytotoxic T lymphocytes. I noted the phenomenon known as "cross-priming" whereby professional antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, process antigen from foreign or infected cells for presentation to cytotoxic T cells. Also, that the T cell receptor repertoire is positively selected in the thymus by weak interactions with self molecules was first reported by me. More recently, my lab has investigated the requirements for the activation of CD8 T cells, their full effector function and their further differentiation to fuctional memory cells. All of these studies are performed with mice as the model organism.As a cellular immunologist I study the development of T lymphocytes in the thymus and the response of mature T cells to pathogens.

VSince the beginning of my scientific career I have been interested in voltage dependent phenomena in cell Physiology. These include the description of the biophysical events of channel function that generate the nerve impulse and the adaptation of these channels to maintain the function of the nervous system in environment where organisms live for. My initial studies were directed to the detailed understanding of the conductance changes during the action potential, followed by studies of voltage gated conductances and the first recordings of the movement of charges (gating currents) responsible for the voltage detection in the nerve membrane. The description of gating currents, macroscopic and single channel ionic currents in voltage-gated channels allowed us to model the voltage sensor as a black box. Only after molecular cloning became available we were able to identify the elements inside the black box and pinpoint the amino acids responsible for the charge movement. Presently, we are monitoring the correlation of the electrical events with structural changes in the channel molecule using real time fluorescence spectroscopy including single molecule fluorescence, lifetimes, quenching and fluorescence resonance energy transfer from probes attached to strategic sites in the molecule of interest while being functional in the membrane. My present interest is the understanding of the dynamics of the molecular correlates of the function in voltage-modulated membrane transport proteins.Since the beginning of my scientific career I have been interested in voltage dependent phenomena in cell Physiology.

VI am a condensed matter physicist who carries out experiments on a variety of different solid and liquid crystal systems. Our primary experimental methods are neutron and synchrotron x-ray scattering. We typically synthesize our own materials and characterize their macroscopic properties with standard techniques. Our focus historically has been on complex materials whose properties are determined in a fundamental way by the effects of dimensionality, quantum fluctuations and/or microscopic quenched disorder. Two systems which we are currently exploring are high temperature superconductors and smectic liquid crystals embedded in dilute silica gel networks. The former is a well researched problem which nevertheless is proving to be remarkably difficult to unravel at a fundamental level. Our own emphasis has been on the microscopic antiferromagnetic fluctuations and their interaction with the superconductivity. The latter represents a new area of research in which disorder and dimensionality effects play a central role. We are currently trying to gather enough basic empirical information to be able to elucidate the fundamental principles which determine the properties of these novel gels.I am a condensed matter physicist who carries out experiments on a variety of different solid and liquid crystal systems.

VMy laboratory is interested in the structure and function of molecules involved in cell surface recognition, particularly those mediating recognition in the immune system, with special attention to the homologs of class I MHC proteins, which function in many ways that are distinct from their immunological role in peptide presentation to T cells. These include an immunoglobulin G receptor (FcRn), the protein mutated in the iron storage disease hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE), a protein that stimulates lipid catabolism (Zn-alpha-2-glycoprotein; ZAG), and virally encoded class I MHC homologs. To study these proteins we use a combined approach of X-ray crystallography to determine structures, molecular biology to produce proteins for crystallization and to modify them, and biochemistry to study protein-protein interactions. In the FcRn and HFE systems we use structural information to address cell biological issues involving intracellular receptor-ligand trafficking, which we are studying by confocal and electron microscopy. We are also interested in bacterial pathogenesis and the innate immune response to bacterial infection. Our efforts in these areas involve the study of the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis protein invasin, the insect immune response protein hemolin, the mammalian mannose receptor, and inhibitory receptor-ligand interactions.My laboratory is interested in the structure and function of molecules involved in cell surface recognition, particularly those mediating recognition in the immune system, with special attention to the homologs of class I MHC proteins, which function in many ways that are distinct from their immunological role in peptide presentation to T cells.

VI am a biophysicist with an avid interest in understanding how Nature's nanoscale machines work. I got my start studying the remarkable rotary engine that powers bacterial flagella, which is driven by a transmembrane current of protons. I then worked on myosin, the protein responsible for muscle contraction, which is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP. That experience led me to study an even smaller ATP-based mechanoenzyme, kinesin, which transports tiny organelles along microtubules inside cells. My laboratory pioneered the development of instrumentation based on optical traps (laser-based 'optical tweezers') that could resolve the individual steps taken by single kinesin molecules, which measure 8.2 nanometers. Steady improvements in technology eventually led to the detection of the even smaller steps made by single molecules of RNA polymerase as these move base by base along a DNA template, and which measure just 3.4 angstroms. Using optical traps, we can now follow-with great precision-structure formation in individual biological macromolecules, such as folding and unfolding transitions in nascent RNA. Today, the field now known as "single molecule biophysics" is thriving, thanks to the advent of new methods of investigation and the successful partnership of physics and biology.I am a biophysicist with an avid interest in understanding how Nature's nanoscale machines work.

VAs a sociologist, I have studied racial attitudes and relations in the U.S., as well as more general topics within public opinion and political behavior, and social inequality. With regard to racial attitudes my work has emphasized careful empirical mapping and theorization of patterns change in the post World War II period in racial attitudes among black and white Americans. Specifically, my work has advanced a group position theory of racial prejudice to explain how and why key issues become sustained, politicized racial controversies (i.e., school busing for desegregation and affirmative action). One stream of my work in public opinion has analyzed the influence of values of tolerance, individualism, and egalitarianism in how U.S. citizens reason about political rights and social inequality. Another stream has focused specifically on the analyzing the values, political attitudes, and behavior of African Americans. In addition, my work has sought to understand the interplay of housing market dynamics, labor market dynamics, and ethno-racial attitudes in the reproduction or transformation of systematic patterns of group segregation, discrimination and inequality in our urban centers.As a sociologist, I have studied racial attitudes and relations in the U.S., as well as more general topics within public opinion and political behavior, and social inequality.

VAs a demographer I have studied the determinants, consequences, and policy implications of the contemporary global demographic transition. This work has focused on the behavioral, socioeconomic, and programmatic determinants of fertility declines in the developing world. These changes in reproductive behavior have been accelerated by family planning programs that were implemented in many countries in response to concern about the adverse consequences of rapid population growth. An analysis of population projections for the twenty-first century indicates that population momentum is now a more important cause of future growth than high fertility. This finding calls for new and different policy responses. A set of related studies has quantified the contribution of population growth to global warming and to rising demand for food. Recently I have examined the determinants of very low fertility in the industrialized world, where population decline and rapid aging are expected to occur over the next few decades. Widely available fertility statistics were found to contain a "tempo" distortion due to the rising mean age at childbearing. This result implies that women are having higher fertility than conventional statistics suggest. A modest upturn in fertility in high-income countries with low birthrates is therefore possible.As a demographer I have studied the determinants, consequences, and policy implications of the contemporary global demographic transition.

VAs a geneticist I have studied how treatments with mutagens cause mouse tumor cells to acquire new antigens recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes. We developed a general approach to clone genes coding for antigens defined as targets of cytolytic T cell clones. This led us to demonstrate the existence of an immunosurveillance mechanism of the integrity of the mammalian genome, whereby point mutations as well as the expression of new genes generate new antigenic peptides recognized by T cells on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. These approaches were then extended to human tumors. We showed that human tumor cells carry at least two classes of antigens that are strictly tumor-specific. A first class of antigens shared by many tumors is encoded by cancer-germline genes which are not expressed on any normal cell except germline cells, which express the genes but not the antigen as they do not carry MHC molecules. The prototype of this class is the Mage gene family. A second class of tumor-specific antigens results from point mutations which, in many instances, are also oncogenic.As a geneticist I have studied how treatments with mutagens cause mouse tumor cells to acquire new antigens recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes.

VAs a Biochemist and Molecular Biologist I have studied the fundamental mechanisms that allow for the creation of two DNA molecules from a single parental molecule- a process that underlies how "like begets like". I have used two different eukaryote models to further advance our understanding of these processes: vertebrate papilloma viruses of many types and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.  Genes often encode for protein activities that perform more than one function and we have uncovered such pleiotropy for the machinery critical to DNA replication. For the viruses our work showed that a viral encoded protein critical for gene expression (transcription of mRNA) binds site specifically to the viral chromosome and targets the viral encoded DNA replication initiator protein to a DNA site called an origin of DNA replication.  From the early embryos of the fruit fly we purified a complex of proteins homologous to a yeast protein called Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) and showed that this ORC complex also needs other proteins with pleiotropic functions in gene expression to successfully assemble an active DNA replication machine. Unwinding of the double helix is a critical first step in the replication of DNA and our recent work shows that for cellular DNA replication a latent enzyme complex called the MCM complex is recruited to ORC before initiation and other protein factors activate the actual "helicase function".As a Biochemist and Molecular Biologist I have studied the fundamental mechanisms that allow for the creation of two DNA molecules from a single parental molecule- a process that underlies how "like begets like".

VMy laboratory investigates the structure and function of biological systems using many tools and methods, always with a strong physical perspective. Three interconnected themes are being pursued. First, we have a long-standing interest in the mechanism of light-driven long-distance electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centers, one of the fastest known reactions. This is being studied by femtosecond fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, manipulation in electric fields, site-specific mutagenesis and some novel types of Stark spectroscopy we have developed and applied to many types of molecules. Related methods are also being used to probe excited state dynamics and electronic structure in variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP), widely used in cell biology. Second, we are broadly interested in electrostatics in proteins and how electrostatics affects function. Our current work uses probes whose sensitivity to electric fields can be calibrated by Stark spectroscopy. Vibrational Stark experiments are particularly useful as they provide a calibration for mapping electrostatic fields in proteins. Probes have also been developed that can measure the time-dependent solvation of charges at different positions in proteins, a key aspect of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions and catalysis. A third major area of interest involves the use of supported lipid bilayers as mimics for cell surfaces and as tools in biotechnology. A broad vision is to engineer interfaces between hard surfaces and soft materials, ultimately leading to sophisticated biocompatible interfaces that can be used to control, interrogate or organize complex living systems. We have developed methods for partitioning and manipulating the composition and organization of these unique self-assembled systems. Recent work addresses the formation of domains and protein association with these domains, interactions of DNA, proteins and cells with supported bilayers, and the mechanism of vesicle fusion, both to solid supports and mediated by proteins. This work has motivated the development of advanced optical microscopy methods for probing the interface between membranes on solid supports and cell membranes, potentially with nm vertical resolution. A novel type of imaging mass spectrometry is being applied to characterize the lateral organization and composition of bilayers and associated membranes with 50 nm resolution.My laboratory investigates the structure and function of biological systems using many tools and methods, always with a strong physical perspective. Three interconnected themes are being pursued. First, we have a long-standing interest in the mechanism of light-driven long-distance electron transfer in photosynthetic reaction centers, one of the fastest known reactions. This is being studied by femtosecond fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy, manipulation in electric fields, site-specific mutagenesis and some novel types of Stark spectroscopy we have developed and applied to many types of molecules. Related methods are also being used to probe excited state dynamics and electronic structure in variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP), widely used in cell biology.

VMy studies in marine geochemistry focus on ocean trace metal chemistry in relation to biogeochemical cycling, anthropogenic inputs, and as a tool for understanding the geological history of the ocean. I obtained some of the first valid data for several trace metals in the ocean (a field that had been plagued for decades by sample contamination and analytical problems). For the past 25 years, I have been tracking the evolution of the anthropogenic Pb transient in the ocean, from its first perceptible rise in the middle of the 19th century (based on sediment and annually-banded coral records) through the decrease due to the phasing out of leaded gasoline. I have also worked on Pb and other anthropogenic trace metals in Greenland ice cores and estuaries. I have discovered that Fe in the deep southwest Pacific derives from distant hydrothermal vents. I have shown that Cd in some species of benthic foraminifera tracks the Cd content of the bottom water they grow in, and have applied this finding to sediment cores to trace past changes in ocean deepwater chemistry which are influenced by changing ocean circulation patterns and changes in biogeochemical cycling within the ocean, including mechanisms that influence atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. I was the first to observe a predicted response of deep AtlanticOcean chemistry to abrupt climate change during the Younger Dryas event 12,900 years ago.My studies in marine geochemistry focus on ocean trace metal chemistry in relation to biogeochemical cycling, anthropogenic inputs, and as a tool for understanding the geological history of the ocean.

VI work on pathways of innate and adaptive immunity. We found a new system of immune recognition mediated by CD1 molecules that enable T lymphocyte responses to lipid antigens from microbes. We are deciphering the mechanisms that determine the delivery, trafficking, processing, loading, and presentation of the lipid antigens that activate CD1 reactive T cells. These T cell responses mediate host defense by providing adaptive immunity against microbial lipid antigens, much like MHC restricted T cells do for protein antigens. A specialized subset of CD1 reactive NKT cells jump starts multiple inflammation pathways as a distinct arm of innate immunity. We are identifying the lipid antigens that stimulate these CD1 reactive T cells and their role in host defense and immunopathology. We also investigate how inflammation induces pathological responses and end-organ damage. We found that mesenchymal cadherin-11 controls the development of the joint synovium and regulates the behavior of synovial fibroblasts activated by inflammation. We are determining how cadherins regulate fibroblast mediated invasion and degradation of joint cartilage in rheumatoid arthritis, and how they impact chronic inflammation. Thus, cadherins not only mediate tissue morphogenesis in development, but also profoundly impact pathological tissue damage.I work on pathways of innate and adaptive immunity.

VI have used quantum field theory, mainly for applications in statistical physics. I have used the field-theoretic formulation of the renormalization group for critical phenomena (equation of states, corrections to scaling, etc) . I have shown that the low temperature phase, in the case of continuous symmetry breaking, is described by a non-linear sigma model, leading to an expansion of critical exponents in powers of the dimension of space minus two. I have shown that the instanton method may be used to characterize the large order behavior of pertubation theory, which in turn allows one to make precise theoretical estimates. I have applied field theory techniques to condensed matter problems such as the theory of critical wetting, or the study of phase transition from a normal metal to a type II superconductor under a magnetic field. I have been interested in field theories with a large number of colors. This has led to a representation of two-dimensional quantum gravity, random fluctuating surfaces, i.e. bosonic closed string theories, in terms of random matrices. We have shown that the scaling limit of such models is related to integrable hierarchies such as KdV flows. I have worked on the basis for the universality of the correlations of eigenvalues in the local limit for random matrices.I have used quantum field theory, mainly for applications in statistical physics.

VMy mathematical research has been devoted to the study of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations and to a variety of problems in mathematical physics and differential geometry, involving such equations. In the past decade, my students and I have investigated models arising in the Thomas-Fermi theory of atoms and molecules, in the theory of liquid crystals and in superconductors. This includes a detailed mathematical analysis of singularities: line and point defects, Ginzburg-Landau vortices, etc. In the closely related problems of global geometry, blow-up phenomena and the appearance of singularities are associated with critical exponents and lack of compactness in the variational formulation.  I have been able to classify all possible singular behavior in many cases, using new techniques and ideas from various sectors of mathematics: calculus of variations, nonlinear functional analysis, estimates in Sobolev spaces of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations, Fourier analysis and the topology of Sobolev manifolds.My mathematical research has been devoted to the study of solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations and to a variety of problems in mathematical physics and differential geometry, involving such equations.

VAs a geneticist, I am interested in the molecular basis for disease resistance in plants. Mendelian factors in both host and pathogen have long been known to determine, in combinatorial fashion, the outcome of disease inception. In the system I study, a filamentous fungus named Cochliobolus carbonum secretes a cyclic tetrapeptide, HC-toxin, that inhibits the histone deacetylases of its host, maize. This enables the fungus to infect the maize which combats the infection by producing a protective enzyme. The enzyme, HC-toxin reductase, inactivates HC-toxin, thus protecting the transcriptional machinery required for mounting a defense response. More recently, I have started the Torrey Mesa Research Institute to develop a research organization that will elucidate the functional relationships between most of the molecules in an organism. Our first step was to develop the technology needed to assay the genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites of rice. Now we are examining the response of rice to perturbations. We will apply a similar approach to mammals. Our goal is to understand the relationship between the physiology of food plants and the physiology of animals that consume them, including humans.As a geneticist, I am interested in the molecular basis for disease resistance in plants.

VMy research encompasses synthetic and mechanistic organometallic chemistry and catalysis, with emphasis on the invention, synthesis, and study of new late-transition metal catalysts for olefin dimerization and polymerization reactions. Insights gained from extensive fundamental studies of migratory insertion reactions have provided guidelines for design and development of numerous new catalytic systems. Examples include cobalt(III) alkyl complexes for living polymerization of ethylene, rhodium(III) catalysts for selective acrylate dimerizations, and palladium(II) complexes for living, alternating copolymerization of CO and olefins. Most recently my group, using specially crafted ligands, developed highly active palladium and nickel catalysts that polymerize ethylene to new forms of highly branched polyethylene, convert alpha-olefins to polymers with unique microstructures and copolymerize polar and nonpolar olefins. Low-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance studies were used to map out the catalytic cycles. Branching was shown to occur by migration of the metal along the polymer chain in competition with monomer insertion. My laboratory has also investigated the interaction of carbon-hydrogen bonds with transition metal centers and constructed catalysts that incorporate a carbon-hydrogen bond activation step in the catalytic cycle. For example, catalysts have been developed that add C-H bonds of various substrates across carbon-carbon double bonds.My research encompasses synthetic and mechanistic organometallic chemistry and catalysis, with emphasis on the invention, synthesis, and study of new late-transition metal catalysts for olefin dimerization and polymerization reactions.

VI perform research on the application of modeling, analysis, and numerical simulation to the development of fundamental understanding of transport processes and chemical physics in the processing of materials with microstructure. Research is currently underway in several applications that are modern examples of multi-scale modeling. One focus is the fluid mechanics of polymers melts and solutions where the configuration of the polymer molecules affects the rheology of the fluid. Current research is on the development of finite-element-based numerical methods for solving flow problems with constitutive descriptions that are based on either continuum-level descriptions of the state of stress in the fluid and kinetic theory based micro-mechanical models. These methods are used to predict flows, flow instabilities, and the microstructure induced by flow in polymer solutions.I perform research on the application of modeling, analysis, and numerical simulation to the development of fundamental understanding of transport processes and chemical physics in the processing of materials with microstructure.

These methods are used to predict flows, flow instabilities, and the microstructure induced by flow in polymer solutions.I perform research on the application of modeling, analysis, and numerical simulation to the development of fundamental understanding of transport processes and chemical physics in the processing of materials with microstructure.

VMy research has focused on two primary areas of investigation: (1) studies of the processes in the initiation and progression of breast cancer and (2) studies of how cellular receptors regulate the intracellular cytoskeleton. In the first area of research, my laboratory has developed a three-dimensional basement membrane model in which mammary epithelial cells can organize in vivo into structures resembling breast glands. Through this model, we are investigating the mechanisms that regulate normal morphogenesis and how oncogenes and genes associated with breast cancer perturb these processes, leading to events that resemble in vivo initiation and progression of tumors.  In the second area of research, we are focused on a family of cellular proteins, called Vav proteins, that are critical in linking cell surface receptors to the actin cytoskeleton through small GTP binding proteins in the RhoGTPase family. Through studies of mice lacking different members of the Vav family, we have found that Vav proteins are critically involved in our defense against microorganisms. We are also investigating how Vav proteins couple receptors for chemotaxis-inducing factors with the cytoskeleton, as well as defining how Vavs function in coordinating the events involved in regulation of cell adhesion and migration.My research has focused on two primary areas of investigation: (1) studies of the processes in the initiation and progression of breast cancer and (2) studies of how cellular receptors regulate the intracellular cytoskeleton.

VMy research is in the physical chemistry of materials--interfaces, nanocrystals, and nanotubes, especially in relation to optical and electronic properties. In each situation we try to figure out what the electrons are doing. This work can include theoretical modeling, numerical DFT calculations, experimental chemical physics, and synthetic chemistry. We try to understand the size evolution of solid state properties from molecular properties. We also seek to create new materials with nanoscale structure by both kinetic and thermodynamic self-assembly methods. We specialize in Electric Force Microscopy and Confocal Laser Optical Microscopy for observation of single nano-objects. In the last several years, we have worked on carbon nanotubes, transition metal oxide nanocrystals, silicon nanocrystals, and Ag nanocrystals acting as microscopic antennas for local electromagnetic field enhancement.My research is in the physical chemistry of materials--interfaces, nanocrystals, and nanotubes, especially in relation to optical and electronic properties.

VMy research has mainly centered on the field of differential geometry, which applies the techniques of calculus to the study of curved objects in various different contexts. In early developments, it was used by Gauss to understand how the curvature of the Earth affected the accuracy of survey maps and, later, by Einstein in his formulation of general relativity. Today, differential geometry plays an important role in computer graphics, in general relativity, in theoretical high energy physics, and in analysis and topology, having been essential in the recent solution of Poincare's conjecture. My own work has involved the study of the systems of differential equations that naturally arise in geometric contexts and the proof of existence and uniqueness theorems for the solutions of these systems of equations. Notably, I proved the existence of geometries with exotic or exceptional holonomy and showed how they were related to various other geometric constructs of interest in both mathematics and physics. I am particularly interested in problems that have hidden symmetries or degeneracies caused by invariance under groups of diffeomorphisms. Currently, I am interested in the geometry of almost complex structures, nonholonomically constrained variational problems, conservation laws, integrable systems, and Finsler manifolds.My research has mainly centered on the field of differential geometry, which applies the techniques of calculus to the study of curved objects in various different contexts.

VAs a synthetic organic chemist, I am interested in the development of new methods that can be utilized for the efficient construction of molecules of academic or industrial relevance. My work has focused on the use of transition metal catalysts to effect selective carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond formation. In particular, my laboratory has developed a set of bulky, electron-rich biaryl phosphine ligands. These can be utilized as components of palladium catalysts in Suzuki-Miyaura and related carbon-carbon bond-forming coupling reactions. Further, they are constituents of excellent catalysts for the formation of aromatic carbon-nitrogen bonds. These methods have seen considerable use in both medicinal and process chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry. Further, they have been applied in academia in the synthesis of natural products and new materials, as well as in bioorganic chemistry. An additional component of our work is to gain a mechanistic underpinning of the fundamental processes of these synthetically important processes. Information gathered from these mechanistic studies can be utilized to design increasingly efficient and general catalysts as well as being of interest in its own right.As a synthetic organic chemist, I am interested in the development of new methods that can be utilized for the efficient construction of molecules of academic or industrial relevance.

VI am interested in the mechanisms that underlie perception. Mammals perceive thousands of environmental chemicals as having odors or tastes. We identified four different types of receptors that recognize odors, pheromones, and bitter and sweet tastes, respectively, explaining how chemicals are initially detected in peripheral sense organs. We found that 1000 different odor receptors are used combinatorially to detect different odors and encode their identities, much like letters of the alphabet are used to form different words. The odor stimulus is deconstructed into a series of features, each encoded by a different receptor. To learn how these deconstructed features generate perceptions, we examined how odor receptor inputs are organized as signals travel from the nose to the olfactory bulb of the brain and then the olfactory cortex. These studies revealed that signals from different receptors are segregated in both the nose and olfactory bulb. However, different receptor inputs are randomly interspersed in the nose whereas the olfactory bulb has a stereotyped map, identical among individuals, in which information from each receptor is mapped onto two specific sites. In the olfactory cortex, there is again a stereotyped map of receptor inputs, but it is unrelated to the bulb map. Here, different receptor inputs overlap extensively and single neurons receive combinatorial receptor inputs. The stereotyped maps in the bulb and cortex assure that the neural codes for odors remain constant over time, explaining how odor chemicals can elicit memories and generate similar perceptions in different individuals. The integration of different receptor inputs in single cortical neurons is likely to represent an initial step in the reconstruction of the deconstructed features of odor stimuli to generate diverse odor perceptions.I am interested in the mechanisms that underlie perception.

VMy research is on the social demography of the family. This work examines how cohabitation, unmarried childbearing, and divorce have altered the face of family life. Half of all marriages are preceded by cohabitation, half end in divorce, and two-fifths of unmarried births occur in two-parent families. In the process the family lives of children have become increasingly unstable despite the two-decade plateau in the divorce rate. These trends require a rethinking of the meaning of "family" and of the unique effects marriage has on family life. I am also examining family change in Europe and in East Asia in order to better understand the dynamics of these trends.  I am co-director of the National Survey of Families and Households, an ongoing longitudinal study that we designed to be interdisciplinary and holistic in its coverage. These data are a resource for the profession that has had a major impact on the way family sociology is conducted, and the data are being used by hundreds of researchers across the nation and around the world.My research is on the social demography of the family.

VUntil recently biochemists and biophysicists were not accustomed to think of cell processes in mechanical terms, in part, because they lacked the appropriate methods to directly detect and measure the tiny mechanical forces generated in the course of biochemical reactions. During the last 10 years my efforts have been directed toward the development and application of methods of single-molecule manipulation, such as force microscopes, magnetic tweezers, and force-measuring laser tweezers. These methods make it possible not only to measure these tiny forces but also to apply external forces to change the extent and even the fate of biochemical reactions, and to learn about the molecular mechanisms by which chemical energy is converted into mechanical work in these reactions. In part as a result of these efforts it is now becoming apparent that many cellular processes involve mechanical processes and many utilize molecular machines capable of converting part of the free energy of the reaction (binding energy, chemical gradient and ATP hydrolysis) into mechanical work and into the generation of force. I am now using single-molecule approaches to study the mechanical unfolding of proteins and RNA, to study the operation of nucleic-acid-binding molecular motors such as RNA and DNA polymerases, and to characterize the mechanical properties of proteins and nucleic acids to better understand their performance in the cell.Until recently biochemists and biophysicists were not accustomed to think of cell processes in mechanical terms, in part, because they lacked the appropriate methods to directly detect and measure the tiny mechanical forces generated in the course of biochemical reactions.

The objects of my investigative affection have included protozoan and arthropod parasites, but I have always had a particular fondness for helminthes, the parasitic worms. Apart from forays into helminth immunology, bionomics, and cryogenics, my research has been focused on experimental chemotherapy. This has led to laboratory biodiversity, with major projects devoted to schistosome and nematode agents of human disease, and with similar attention lavished on flukes of cattle, tapeworms of sheep, roundworms of ruminants, and heartworm of dogs. Research in an industrial setting, where interdisciplinary collaboration was a way of life, gave me the enormous satisfaction of participating in the process whereby molecules become drugs and move, sometimes, from laboratory bench to field or clinic. Among the new drugs that went on to widespread practical use were thiabendazole, cambendazole, rafoxanide, clorsulon, and ivermectin. Now in an academic setting, I try to share my enthusiasm for parasites with youthful scientists in the classroom and in the research laboratory. Although my allegiance to particular parasites may have been fickle, my involvement in the affairs of Trichinella, the agent of trichinellosis (trichinosis), has been my constant avocation and delight.My life in science has been devoted to the study of parasitic infections.

VI'm probably best described as a geobiologist. In earlier work, I studied the fates of organic carbon, Fe and sulfur in marine sediments. This turned out to be relevant for understanding the long-term evolution of biogeochemical cycles on Earth. Here, I have focused on the history of atmospheric oxygen as well as interactions between biological evolution and the history of Earth surface chemical change. This work requires a 2-prong approach. I work with modern microbes and modern microbial ecosystems to understand how they cycle elements and importantly what clues of their activity they might be left in the geologic record. This is interfaced with geological field work. Here, we collect and analyze ancient sediments from key periods in Earth history to deduce the chemical nature of the environment in which the sediments formed. If lucky, we can also deduce the ecology of the organisms that once lived in the environment. Some key recent findings include: the proposition and later demonstration of middle Precambrian sulfidic marine conditions, the demonstration of late Neoproterozoic marine deep water oxygenation in approximate concert with early evolution of large animals, and the discovery of a new microbial nitrogen metabolism, the ANAMMOX process, in oxygen-free zones of the marine water column.I'm probably best described as a geobiologist.

VMy primary work has involved the biochemical signaling pathways that regulate normal mammalian cell growth and the defects that can cause cell transformation. More than a decade ago, my laboratory discovered a phosphoinositide kinase that was activated by growth factor receptors and by oncoproteins. This enzyme catalyzed an unexpected reaction, the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the D-3 position of the inositol ring, thus leading to the discovery of a new signal transduction pathway. Subsequent research from my laboratory and other laboratories showed that PI 3-kinase activation is critical for oncogene-mediated cell transformation, as well as for insulin-dependent stimulation of glucose uptake and metabolism. This and more recent work on PI 3-kinase as a mechanism of regulated recruitment to cell membranes has led to a better understanding of the importance of this enzyme in development, immunity, and cancers. Another major area of my work has focused on the structural basis for specificity in protein/protein interactions in signal transduction cascades, in particular, on the mechanism by which protein phosphorylation can control the assembly of signaling complexes. Through the work of my laboratory and others, it has been possible to determine structures of protein-peptide complexes and thus explain how specificity in signaling is maintained. These studies have also allowed predictions of intracellular targets of signaling proteins on the basis of primary sequence data banks.My primary work has involved the biochemical signaling pathways that regulate normal mammalian cell growth and the defects that can cause cell transformation.

VOur group is interested in understanding the molecular and cellular elements that regulate the type and intensity of antimicrobial immunity and maintain self-tolerance. We believe that interactions between T cell subsets and other immunological cells are at the core of this process. In recent years we have identified and characterized genes that allow robust T cell activation after TCR engagement. Our studies of the role of T cells in imprinting the type of immune response following viral infection have led to the isolation and characterization of a gene and its secreted product (Eta1/Opn) that enhances Type I immunity through interactions with macrophages and dendritic cells. Studies of the interactions between the immune system and viruses have delineated a molecular link between infection and autoimmune disease based on T cell receptor cross-reactivity. Our current research uses a combination of genetic and cellular approaches to define potential sub-lineages of CD4 and CD8 cells that are genetically programmed to carry out regulatory or effector T cell function.Our group is interested in understanding the molecular and cellular elements that regulate the type and intensity of antimicrobial immunity and maintain self-tolerance.

VThe mysteries surrounding the origin and development of human conceptual understanding have occupied philosophers at least since the time of the ancient Greeks. In the last century these questions began to yield to empirical study. My research illuminates the nature and acquisition of human knowledge on three different time scales: evolutionary, historical, and individual. I have focused on children's and adults' understanding of number, other minds, and the biological and material world. In each case I characterize the existence, content, and if possible, format of innate representations, demonstrate the ways that the innate representations continue to function throughout the life span, and chart the ways humans transcend these initial starting points. Prelinguistic human infants and nonhuman primates share many systems of mental representation, and one focus of my research is relating these to the representations that articulate human languages in order to understand language acquisition, especially the meanings expressed in morphology and the lexicon. Characterizing the learning mechanisms that allow human beings to go beyond innate knowledge informs attempts to enhance the teaching of science and mathematics, another focus of my research.The mysteries surrounding the origin and development of human conceptual understanding have occupied philosophers at least since the time of the ancient Greeks.

VIn early work, I used genetic analysis in yeast to study transcriptional regulation in response to glucose deprivation. I isolated sucrose-nonfermenting (snf) mutants that were unable to express the glucose-repressed SUC2 gene. Analysis of these mutants led us to identify subunits of SNF1 protein kinase and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, which proved to have broad roles in transcriptional control. Our finding that the SNF1 gene encodes a protein kinase catalytic subunit showed that protein phosphorylation is required for release of glucose repression, and we went on to study mechanisms by which SNF1 controls transcription of metabolic genes. We also showed that SNF1 protein kinase is a heterotrimer with alternate noncatalytic subunits, and we characterized interactions among the subunits and their roles in regulating catalytic activity and subcellular localization. We discovered three protein kinases that phosphorylate the catalytic subunit and activate SNF1. SNF1 is highly conserved, and its human ortholog is AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which similarly has a central role in metabolic regulation. The identification of yeast kinases that activate SNF1 allowed us to identify the related human kinase LKB1, a tumor suppressor, as the first activating kinase of AMPK.In early work, I used genetic analysis in yeast to study transcriptional regulation in response to glucose deprivation.

VMy research is on the testing of cosmological models of the Universe using new telescopes and instruments to image the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the fossil radiation from the early Universe. Through detailed measurements of the background radiation, my research group and I have shown that the curvature of the Universe is flat, supporting inflationary models and providing a determination of the total density of the Universe. We find that ordinary matter, the stuff of stars and us, accounts for only about 5 percent of the density. Another roughly 30 percent is composed of dark matter, presumably a yet-to-be-identified particle. Even less is known about the remaining, dominant component: the mysterious dark energy that apparently is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate. I plan to learn more about the nature of dark energy by measuring its affect on the density evolution of the largest bound objects in the Universe: clusters of galaxies. I will inventory the clusters in the distant Universe by surveying large regions of the sky for the small distortions in the background radiation caused by its interaction with hot cluster atmospheres, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.My research is on the testing of cosmological models of the Universe using new telescopes and instruments to image the intensity and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the fossil radiation from the early Universe.

VI have done considerable work on the biological regulation of carbon fixation and phosphorus cycling in lakes. By experimental manipulation of entire lakes, this research has shown how food web structure controls phosphorus allocation and mineralization, carbon fixation, and gas exchange between lakes and the atmosphere. I am currently investigating the roles of carbon fixation by phytoplankton and other plants, as well as inputs of carbon from the surrounding landscape, in aquatic food webs. Other recent studies have centered on the ecology of regime shifts in ecosystems, such as the changes caused by habitat alteration, overharvest or overfertilization, invasion, and extinction. Working with economists, mathematicians, and other ecologists, I am exploring methods to collapse or preserve regimes. The approaches that preserve ecological regimes tend to be ones that main ecological variability within broad thresholds.I have done considerable work on the biological regulation of carbon fixation and phosphorus cycling in lakes.

VMy laboratory has studied several ways in which RNA functions as genetic information and a regulatory molecule. I started my career as a virologist focused on small viruses containing genomes composed of RNA. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identified and dissected both plant and viral functions involved in RNA replication, cell-to-cell and long-distance movement, pathogenicity, and defense. By analyzing a protein required for long-distance movement and virulence, we discovered that plant viruses encode suppressors of RNA silencing, or RNA interference. This provided strong evidence for RNA interference functioning as an adaptive defense response in plants. Subsequently, I examined the biological functions, diversification and genomics of RNA silencing, using primarily the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified several classes of plant small RNA, which all function as molecular guides to confer sequence-specific regulation at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. We showed that different types of small RNA, such as short-interfering RNA and microRNA, are formed through the activities of specialized biogenesis components, and provide unique functions through their association with specialized Argonaute proteins. Additionally, we showed how small RNA-directed silencing pathways function across the Arabidopsis genome, which has helped to unravel the ways in which plant genomes are controlled.My laboratory has studied several ways in which RNA functions as genetic information and a regulatory molecule.

VMy research has focused on how genes control the formation and differentiation of animal body parts and how changes in the way these genes are regulated during embryonic development shape animal diversity. Through detailed studies of the model organism the fruit fly, my laboratory has analyzed how certain types of regulatory proteins, called selector proteins, control the development of body appendages. Our work has revealed that selector proteins control the deployment of many genes by binding to control regions in the DNA sequence surrounding these genes, called cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Advances in understanding the genetic regulation of development of this model animal have provided the foundation for understanding how morphology evolves. Most importantly, the conserved sequences of selector proteins and the modular architecture of gene cis-regulatory regions led me to suggest that changes in CREs play a primary role in the evolution of animal form. In a series of recent studies, we have shown how the gain and loss of various traits, such as a spot on an insect wing, has occurred by the modification of CREs, There is now abundant support for the general idea that morphology largely evolves via changes in DNA regulatory sequences.My research has focused on how genes control the formation and differentiation of animal body parts and how changes in the way these genes are regulated during embryonic development shape animal diversity. Through detailed studies of the model organism the fruit fly, my laboratory has analyzed how certain types of regulatory proteins, called selector proteins, control the development of body appendages. Our work has revealed that selector proteins control the deployment of many genes by binding to control regions in the DNA sequence surrounding these genes, called cis-regulatory elements (CREs).

VThe focus of my laboratory is the identification and therapeutic exploitation of biochemical targets that distinguish malignant and normal cells. Based upon the results of metabolic studies of immunodeficiency diseases in children, my research group developed 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine [2CdA] as a lymphocyte depleting agent. 2CdA is the drug of choice for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, inducing long term remissions in most patients. It is also effective in several other diseases associated with excessive lymphocyte proliferation. My laboratory also discovered the homozygous deletion of an enzyme in purine metabolism, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase [MTAP] in about a quarter of all cancers, and showed that the deletion also encompassed the p16INK4A tumor suppressor gene. Subsequently we developed a cancer treatment that selectively kills the enzyme deficient cancer cells, without harming most normal cells. More recently, my laboratory has identified anomalies in the xpression and function of receptors from the wnt/ frizzled, and Toll-like receptor pathways in human malignancies.The focus of my laboratory is the identification and therapeutic exploitation of biochemical targets that distinguish malignant and normal cells.

VAlthough trained as a chemist, I work at intersection of chemistry, materials science, applied physics, applied mathematics, and mechanical and aerospace engineering. All of my research begins with quantum mechanics, and much of my work is devoted to developing efficient quantum mechanics based computer simulation techniques that accurately predict physical properties and chemical reactivity of molecules and materials, either at the atomic scale or across multiple length scales. We also combine quantum mechanics methods with statistical mechanics (molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, or kinetic Monte Carlo) or solid mechanics (finite element or quasi-continuum) techniques to obtain a holistic view of the molecule or material being interrogated. These methods have been applied to a wide range of important problems, including etching and growth of silicon (used for integrated circuit and solar cell technology), improving thermal barrier coatings for jet engines (used to improve fuel efficiency in airplanes and power plants), and inhibiting steel corrosion (a multibillion dollar per year problem for a vast set of industries). At present, my interests have turned toward materials design for energy applications, including designing novel yet inexpensive materials for efficient solar energy conversion to electricity and fuels, as well as optimization of lightweight metal alloys to improve fuel efficiency in land and air vehicles.Although trained as a chemist, I work at intersection of chemistry, materials science, applied physics, applied mathematics, and mechanical and aerospace engineering.

VMy main research area is space research in Earth sciences.  As a space geodesist, I have used a variety of space techniques to study the solid Earth and its fluid envelopes. My solid Earth research was mainly dedicated to measurements of the Earth gravity field over the oceans using satellite altimetry with applications in marine geophysics (in particular the mechanical and thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere). I have also been involved in precise positioning using space techniques to measure large-scale tectonic motions, vertical crustal motions and motions of the geocenter. Since about a decade, I am working on sea level variations in response to climate variability and climate change, measuring the rate of sea level rise at global and regional scales using tide gauges and high precision altimetry and studying the main climatic causes (ocean thermal expansion, land ice melt, land water storage change). I am also interested in measuring temporal changes of the Earth gravity field using space gravimetry and in applications to ice sheet mass balance and change in total land water storage. In the recent years, I also contributed to develop space hydrology using satellite altimetry on surface waters (rivers, lakes and floodplains) and space gravimetry for studying the water budget at river basin scales, with applications to the continental water cycle.My main research area is space research in Earth sciences.

VI am interested in the mechanisms that direct development of the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates. I have focused our studies on the retina, a relatively simple and well-characterized area of the CNS. My laboratory has used genomics approaches to examine gene expression during murine retinal development. We have further investigated the cellular specificity of expression patterns by performing in situ hybridization for over 1,000 genes with dynamic temporal patterns, and by performing gene profiling on single retinal cells. These studies led to the identification of many excellent candidate genes suspected to be important in retinal development and disease. To understand the function of genes identified in these and other screens we are using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches (e.g., retroviral transduction, electroporation, RNAi, and knock-out mice). In vitro culture systems that mimic retinal development also have been developed and are being used to investigate the role of the environment. We have recently begun to study the mechanisms of the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in murine models of retinitus pigmentosa and macular degeneration. We are also studying how the pattern of photoreceptor distribution is determined early in development.I am interested in the mechanisms that direct development of the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates.

VIn the first part of my career, I did theoretical and phenomenological work in high-energy astrophysics. I studied cosmic ray propagation, and developed an energy-dependent leaky box model based on resonant interactions of cosmic rays with hydromagnetic waves, in relation with interstellar turbulence and the heating of the interstellar medium. With P. O. Lagage, we studied diffusive particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks, and established an upper limit to the energy that cosmic rays can gain from a supernova shock through this mechanism.  Subsequently, I have led the development of the camera on board of the Infrared Space Observatory, and organized the ISOCAM Central programme, which provided new insights into infrared emission from the diffuse interstellar medium and normal galaxies, star formation in molecular clouds, dust formation in supernovae, dust embedded star formation in colliding galaxies, etc. I was the Principal Investigator of the ITGES collaboration, which conducted deep surveys with ISOCAM, with a gain in sensitivity with respect to the previous mission, IRAS, of more than three orders of magnitude. We showed that the dominant contributors to the considerable energy in the Cosmic Infrared Background are Luminous Infrared Galaxies with median redshift 0.8. We continue our studies on galaxy evolution, using space as well as ground-based facilities, and in particular the ESO Very Large Telescope.In the first part of my career, I did theoretical and phenomenological work in high-energy astrophysics.

I studied cosmic ray propagation, and developed an energy-dependent leaky box model based on resonant interactions of cosmic rays with hydromagnetic waves, in relation with interstellar turbulence and the heating of the interstellar medium. With P. O. Lagage, we studied diffusive particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks, and established an upper limit to the energy that cosmic rays can gain from a supernova shock through this mechanism.  Subsequently, I have led the development of the camera on board of the Infrared Space Observatory, and organized the ISOCAM Central programme, which provided new insights into infrared emission from the diffuse interstellar medium and normal galaxies, star formation in molecular clouds, dust formation in supernovae, dust embedded star formation in colliding galaxies, etc. I was the Principal Investigator of the ITGES collaboration, which conducted deep surveys with ISOCAM, with a gain in sensitivity with respect to the previous mission, IRAS, of more than three orders of magnitude. We showed that the dominant contributors to the considerable energy in the Cosmic Infrared Background are Luminous Infrared Galaxies with median redshift 0.8. We continue our studies on galaxy evolution, using space as well as ground-based facilities, and in particular the ESO Very Large Telescope.

VI have been studying many aspects of condensed matter physics with an eye toward understanding strongly interacting many particle systems, their cooperative behavior, phases, phase transitions and dynamics. In "hard" condensed matter (quantum physics) my research has centered on the low temperature properties of correlated electrons, particularly organic conductors and superconductors. Here using temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure to control dimensionality and interactions, we contributed to the discovery of many new ground states (e.g. the "Field induced Spin Density Wave / 3 Dimensional Quantum Hall Effect"), and several new forms of Fermi Surface probes and angular dependent magnetotransport. In the area of soft condensed matter physics our research involves the use of model systems to investigate the fundamental physics of crystallization, quasi-periodicity, frustration, particle packing and long range potential and dynamic interactions. Our experiments pioneered the study of colloids in microgravity with insights into crystal nucleation and growth and the glass transition. We have also used diblock copolymer systems in thin films to study the kinetics of two dimensional pattern formation and annealing. We are able to make atomic force microscopy movies which graphically demonstrate the importance of topological defects in the annealing process. Our technological developments of these films have led to a new field, nanolithography with diblock copolymers.I have been studying many aspects of condensed matter physics with an eye toward understanding strongly interacting many particle systems, their cooperative behavior, phases, phase transitions and dynamics.

VMost of my research have centered on understanding the development and function of nerve cells. Using classical and molecular genetic approaches, my lab has studied the six neurons that sense gentle touch in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate how individual types of nerve cells are generated and how mechanical forces are sensed. We find that the differentiation of the touch receptor neurons is quite complex, involving the combinatorial action of several different factors that either enable or prevent the differentiation of the cells. One of these factors was the first LIM homeodomain transcription factor; these proteins are now known to regulate neuronal differentiation in invertebrates and invertebrates. Molecular understanding of mechanical senses (e.g., touch, hearing, and balance) has lagged behind that of other senses because of the difficulty of obtaining putative transduction molecules and of assaying their function. By studying mutants that cannot respond to touch but have differentiated touch receptor neurons, we identified several proteins that are important for mechanosensation in C. elegans. Recent electrophysiological evidence has demonstrated that a channel complex formed from four of these proteins is needed for the transduction current. The analysis of the touch genes has provided one of the first molecular models for mechanosensation. My lab has also developed several methods, most notably green fluorescent (GFP) protein and more recently reconstituted GFP as biological markers.Most of my research have centered on understanding the development and function of nerve cells.

Another effort of my group is the direct measurement of forces induced by order parameter fluctuation near the superfluid, tricritical, and liquid vapor-critical points. These forces, analogous to the Casimir force induced by the fluctuation of the electromagnetic field, were predicted by Pierre de Gennes and Michael E.

VMy research program investigates the regulation of gene expression using the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in maize. I use this system to investigate mechanisms of gene silencing, which has a fundamental role in development and is a genetic engineering impediment. We study paramutation, the regulation of transposable elements and transgene silencing. Paramutation is a mitotically and meiotically heritable change in gene expression that is induced by allele interactions. My laboratory has shown that the heritable change is accompanied by a ten-fold reduction in transcription, which is associated with chromatin differences. Using a combination of classical genetics, genomics, and molecular methods we mapped the minimal sequences required for paramutation, to 95-102 kbp upstream of the transcription initiation site. We identified multiple genes required for paramutation and showed that these genes are also involved in transposon and transgene silencing. Currently I am using cis- and trans-acting mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying paramutation and transposon and transgene silencing. As heritable changes in chromatin structure are involved in the establishment and maintenance of distinct transcription states, my laboratory is also using functional genomics to investigate chromatin-level control of gene expression in both maize and Arabidopsis.My research program investigates the regulation of gene expression using the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in maize.

Gradually my interest shifts to problems in geometric analysis--using methods in analysis in particular the tool of partial differential equations to study problems in differential geometry. In recent year, the main focus of my research interest is in "conformal geometry", a recent project is to generalize the classical uniformization theorem from compact surfaces to a class of four dimensional spaces according to the sign of some conformally invariant geometric quantities, in particular to recognize the four dimensional sphere. The problem is ultimately related to the problems in conformal field theory in mathematical physics.I am a mathematician, my research interests has evolved over the years--in the early stage of my career, I am interested in problems in classical harmonic analysis studying local and boundary behavior of functions under global constraints.

VAs a hematologist, I have devoted myself to the study of pathogeneses and therapies of hematological malignancies, especially acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In my study, I discovered that arsenic trioxide (As2O3), a traditional Chinese medicine, had a very strong therapeutic effect on APL with high complete remission and disease-free survival rates. Through systematic study on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of As2O3, I found that the compound induces apoptosis or differentiation of APL cells in a dose-dependent manner, and discovered that As2O3 targets PML-RAR , an oncoprotein resulting from APL chromosomal translocation t(15;17) as an essential player in the pathogenesis, and triggers its degradation. More recently, my group demonstrated that induction/maintenance with the combined use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a differentiatin inducer, and As2O3 yields a high quality clinical/molecular remission and a better disease-free survival in newly diagnosed patients with APL, as compared to mono-therapy with ATRA or As2O3. This new finding makes APL the first hematological malignancy that could be possibly cured. In addition to my interest in leukemic study, I have been coordinating the human genome program in China. My own group has contributed to the sequencing and gene discovery of human genome, and complete genomic sequencing and annotation of several pathogens such as leptospira interrogans and Schistosoma japonicum. My group also identified the first nasopharyngeal cancer susceptibility locus and the first gene responsible for atrial fibrillation.As a hematologist, I have devoted myself to the study of pathogeneses and therapies of hematological malignancies, especially acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

VAs an experimental pathologist I study the host-virus interactions that determine the pathogenesis and outcome of viral infections. Using the hepatitis B virus as a model and infected humans, chimpanzees, and transgenic mice as experimental vehicles, my laboratory defined the helper and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses to this virus and established the immunological basis for viral clearance, disease pathogenesis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In collaboration with Brinster and Palmiter my laboratory developed the first transgenic mouse models of a human viral pathogen. We used these models to demonstrate and dissect the immune pathogenesis of viral hepatitis and liver cancer and to discover that virus-specific T cells and cells of the innate immune system secrete antiviral cytokines that can purge viruses from infected cells without killing them, challenging our concept of the host-virus relationship as a simple cytopathic interaction. Recently I have used biochemical, molecular, and genomic approaches to define the viral targets and intracellular signaling pathways that mediate this antiviral activity and to study the cellular and molecular basis for these novel, immune-mediated, antiviral events.As an experimental pathologist I study the host-virus interactions that determine the pathogenesis and outcome of viral infections.

Over the past decade I have focused my work on one particular microorganism, Prochlorococcus, which is a cyanobacterium that numerically dominates oceanic phytoplankton. It is the smallest known photosynthetic cell, has only 2000 genes, and is responsible for a significant fraction of global photosynthesis. My research is aimed at understanding the factors that regulate the distribution and abundance of Prochlorococcus in the sea, and we approach this by studying it at all levels of biological organization from the genome to the ecosystem. As our ability to predict the dynamics of this model organism grows, so will our ability to understand the complex microbial interactions that shape oceanic ecosystems.I am a biological oceanographer interested in the structure and dynamics of marine microbial communities and their role in regulating planetary functions.

VAs a biochemist, I have devoted almost all my career to study intracellular protein degradation. As a graduate student with Avram Hershko in the Technion in Haifa, Israel, and in collaboration with Irwin Rose, we discovered that covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to a substrate protein targets it for degradation by a downstream protease that recognizes only ubiquitinated proteins. This major discovery opened an entire new and important field in biomedicine. I has become apparent that biological regulation by degradation controls numerous basic cellular processes, such as cell division, cellular quality control, differentiation, communication among intracellular organelles and between the cell with its external environment. It led later to the discovery that conjugation of ubiquitin and members of the ubiquitin-like proteins family can serve also numerous non-proteolytic functions. With the many substrates and processes regulated by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, it was just a matter of time to discover that malfunction of the system underlies the pathogenesis of many diseases, malignancies, neurodegeneration, and disorders of the immune and inflammatory systems, among them. This resulted in the development of novel rationale drugs. Current research in the laboratory focuses on deciphering the mechanisms that underlie ubiquitination, the regulation of transcription factors such as MyoD, NF-kB, and p53 by the ubiquitin system, and the involvement of the system in regulating apoptosis. In parallel and independently, many efforts are invested in promoting education of the public in science and technology and using it as a tool to promote peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East.As a biochemist, I have devoted almost all my career to study intracellular protein degradation.

With the many substrates and processes regulated by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, it was just a matter of time to discover that malfunction of the system underlies the pathogenesis of many diseases, malignancies, neurodegeneration, and disorders of the immune and inflammatory systems, among them. This resulted in the development of novel rationale drugs. Current research in the laboratory focuses on deciphering the mechanisms that underlie ubiquitination, the regulation of transcription factors such as MyoD, NF-kB, and p53 by the ubiquitin system, and the involvement of the system in regulating apoptosis. In parallel and independently, many efforts are invested in promoting education of the public in science and technology and using it as a tool to promote peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East.As a biochemist, I have devoted almost all my career to study intracellular protein degradation. As a graduate student with Avram Hershko in the Technion in Haifa, Israel, and in collaboration with Irwin Rose, we discovered that covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to a substrate protein targets it for degradation by a downstream protease that recognizes only ubiquitinated proteins. This major discovery opened an entire new and important field in biomedicine.

VCalcium ions regulate almost all aspects of the life of a cell. Cells of the heart, brain, and muscle are equipped with specialized voltage-sensitive, highly calcium-selective ion channels. Opening of these channels provides the sharp, decisive rise in calcium that initiates rapid contraction in heart and skeletal muscle, as well as the secretion of transmitters in neurons. Other cells, such as those in blood and solid organs, use a distinct set of calcium-permeant channels. These channels control cellular aspects as diverse as cell migration, secretion, and apoptosis. We investigate ways that calcium enters cells via all classes of ion channels. We are interesting in aspects ranging from high-resolution protein structure to the genetics and physiology of these ion channels.Calcium ions regulate almost all aspects of the life of a cell.

VNoel Clark was born in 1940 in Cleveland, Ohio, where he received his B.S. and M.S. physics degrees in physics at John Carroll University. He received his Ph.D. from MIT in 1970 and spent the next seven years in the Harvard liquid crystal group with Peter Pershan and Robert Meyer, first as a research fellow and then as junior faculty. He moved to Boulder in 1977 where he is currently Professor of Physics at the University of Colorado. He has worked in many areas of soft condensed matter/complex fluid physics, mostly liquid crystals and colloids. Research highlights include initiating, while at Harvard, the study of ultrathin freely suspended liquid crystal films and a career-long interest in their properties; discovery, with Sven Lagerwall, of surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystals (fluid ferroelectric domains); observation, with the Boulder team, of macroscopic chiral domains (chiral conglomerate formation) in fluid liquid crystal phases of achiral molecules; observation with Tommaso Bellini of the liquid crystal phases of nanometer length DNA and the proposal that templating by liquid crystal phases was responsible for the appearance of self replicating linear polymers in early life. In 1984 he co-founded Displaytech, Inc., currently the world's leading maker of ferroelectric liquid crystal devices and materials. His work is the most cited among experimentalists who have worked in liquid crystals.Noel Clark was born in 1940 in Cleveland, Ohio, where he received his B.S. and M.S. physics degrees in physics at John Carroll University.

VAs a geographer and demographer my primary research interests are the study of residential mobility, urban segregation and the broader social structure of cities. I have carried out a sustained research program to show how life course events are linked to residential mobility behavior, the ways in which selection and sorting across the urban mosaic creates the neighborhood structures of our cities, and in turn how neighborhoods are linked to the labor market. With colleagues and students my research now focuses on neighborhood inequality and social outcomes, and their impact on the intention to move or stay in the neighborhood. A recent jointly edited book () brings together a group of geographers, economists, planners and demographers and lays out the central issues in, mobility, segregation, housing and neighborhood choice. The research on segregation provided some of the first empirical tests of the Schelling models of choice. Those papers showed that the theoretical tolerance distributions outlined by Schelling could be generated from survey data. Most recently the Schelling model has been translated into an agent based model with survey preferences as the basis for the predicted outcomes.As a geographer and demographer my primary research interests are the study of residential mobility, urban segregation and the broader social structure of cities.

VMy research addresses interactions between human development and Earth's environment. I seek to understand what shapes the long-term, large-scale dynamics of those interactions and how knowledge can be better mobilized to guide them along mutually sustaining trajectories. One thread of my work has explored the processes that determine the vulnerability and resilience of coupled nature-society systems. Another has traced the historical evolution of such systems, with special attention to the interplay among ideas, interests, and institutions in shaping human responses to environmental change. Increasingly, however, I am focusing my research on the question of how society can better utilize science and technology as tools for learning sustainable development. This work has involved the design of indicator systems for informing ecosystem management, the evaluation of alternative approaches to environmental assessment, and analyzing why some institutional arrangements have been more effective than others for mobilizing R&D in support of decision making. These are inherently collaborative endeavors and have involved me in nurturing a variety of international, interdisciplinary research and training programs.My research addresses interactions between human development and Earth's environment.

VI have been interested in how accurate chromosome inheritance is achieved and how errors in this drive tumorigenesis. An initial finding was discovery of the tubulin gene families encoding the major subunits of microtubules and the first mammalian example of control of gene expression through regulated RNA instability. Components required for microtubule nucleation and anchoring during spindle assembly were identified, as well as the events activating and silencing the major cell cycle control mechanism (the mitotic checkpoint) that acts to prevent errors of chromosome segregation when cells divide. Other findings included demonstration that the extreme asymmetry of neurons is achieved with a deformable array of interlinked neurofilaments, microtubules and actin. I identified the first microtubule associated protein, tau, mutation in which was subsequently shown to cause human cognitive disease. A final contribution has been in the mechanism underlying premature death of motor neurons in inherited ALS (or Lou Gehrig's disease). This was shown to require mutant damage to both motor neurons and their neighboring supporting cells, a finding establishing stem cell replacement of non-neuronal cells as a viable therapy. Finally, a gene silencing therapy has been developed that may be broadly applicable to ALS and other major neurodegenerative diseases.I have been interested in how accurate chromosome inheritance is achieved and how errors in this drive tumorigenesis.

VInterests in my laboratory revolve around the function and regulation of protein kinases in signal transduction pathways. A major goal is to identify and understand the regulatory mechanisms and functions of components of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. These protein kinases are important participants in controlling cellular events such as proliferation, differentiation, homeostasis, motility, and cell death. Current work focuses on the following: 1. Mechanisms controlling signaling specificity. Many ligands activate an overlapping array of signaling pathways. We are defining protein-protein interactions and mechanisms of subcellular localization of signal transducers to understand how distinct outputs are generated by different hormones and other agents. 2. Signal transduction mechanisms used by nutrients to regulate the biology of beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. These cells produce and secrete insulin. We are learning how MAPKs and WNKs help to coordinate these processes. 3. Mechanisms of action of the WNK subfamily of protein kinases. These enzymes are causative in certain forms of hypertension. We are determining their normal functions and how they impact the behavior of epithelial cells that can lead to disease. 4. Structure-function relationships in the protein kinase family. In collaboration with Betsy Goldsmith, we use mutagenesis and X-ray crystallography to understand regulatory mechanisms in kinase cascades.Interests in my laboratory revolve around the function and regulation of protein kinases in signal transduction pathways.

VAs a plant molecular geneticist I have studied the mechanisms controlling floral development. Through extensive mutant screens in Antirrhinum (snapdragon) I identified and characterized three classes of key regulatory genes, most of which encode transcription factors. The first class comprises genes that control the switch from shoot to floral meristems and therefore sets the overall architecture of the plant. The second class consists of genes that act in combination to establish the basic plan of the flower as a series of concentric whorls of different organ types. This work, together with parallel studies in Arabidopsis, led to a unified model of flower development, termed the ABC model, which has provided a framework for subsequent studies in the field. The third class of genes controls the dorsoventral asymmetry of the flower. This has allowed the development and evolution of floral asymmetry to be studied at the molecular level for the first time. More recently I have been trying to understand how patterns of gene activity lead to the growth of organs with specific sizes and shapes. This involves a combination of experimental studies and mathematical modeling.As a plant molecular geneticist I have studied the mechanisms controlling floral development.

VI have spent most of my research career studying basic mechanisms of regulation of immune response. In particular, I have been interested in how different classes of both B and T lymphocyte responses to foreign antigens are controlled. In many cases, the class of an immune response will determine whether it protects from and infectious or allergic disease, or causes it.  More recently I have focused on the innate immune system, an evolutionarily ancient system of recognition and response to conserved microbial molecules that provides a rapid "front line" of defense against pathogens. Cells and molecules of this innate response provide many key regulatory signals determining the class of subsequent adaptive T and B lymphocyte responses. I have been particularly interested in manipulating the link between innate and adaptive immunity to treat immunological diseases and to develop more effective vaccines. My current research is focused on preclinical and clinical development of molecules that either stimulate or inhibit specific arms of the innate immune system, with particular interest in developing new therapies for allergic and autoimmune diseases.I have spent most of my research career studying basic mechanisms of regulation of immune response.

VMost of my career has been devoted to studying the role of protein phosphorylation in cell regulation and have contributed to several areas of this field.

VBlood platelets help to arrest bleeding at sites of vascular injury by adhering to damaged blood vessels, aggregating one with another, and facilitating thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation. Platelet abnormalities, therefore, result in excessive bleeding. Platelets also contribute to thrombotic vascular disease since platelet aggregation can close off a blood vessel that is narrowed by atherosclerosis, resulting in a myocardial infarction or stroke.   By studying human genetic disorders of platelet surface receptors, I and others identified the GPIIb/IIIa (IIb 3) integrin receptor as important in platelet aggregation. I then produced monoclonal antibodies that block the binding of ligands to the receptor, and thus prevent platelet aggregation. I helped to develop one of these antibodies into a drug (abciximab; Centocor) that prevents thrombotic complications of coronary angioplasty and stent placement. It is now being evaluated as treatment for stroke.   Recently, I began collaborative studies to understand better the vascular complications of sickle cell disease, including stroke and episodes of severe bone pain. We have identified the V 3 integrin receptor and adherent leukocytes as important in producing blood vessel obstruction by sickle cells. We are now testing new therapeutic interventions to inhibit the interactions between leukocytes, sickle red blood cells, and the blood vessel wall.Blood platelets help to arrest bleeding at sites of vascular injury by adhering to damaged blood vessels, aggregating one with another, and facilitating thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation.

VAs a microbial ecologist, I have studied the metabolism, systematics, evolution, and ecology of marine bacteria and viruses, specifically the Vibrionaceae and Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera pandemics. Vibrio cholerae is autochthonous to the marine and estuarine environment, has an absolute requirement for Na+, and is associated with zooplankton, notably copepods, all of which my laboratory was able to establish. We showed that this bacterium and related vibrios exhibit a starvation response, and also showed that the bacterium is capable of entering a dormant stage. With this information, we developed highly specific gene probes for direct detection of the bacterium in the environment and for monitoring its seasonality. We devised a simple filtration method for use in developing countries to prevent cholera. Research on marine viruses has demonstrated their unexpected abundance in estuaries. My most recent research is focused on the effects of climate on human health, specifically infectious diseases. We are employing interdisciplinary approaches to understand these complex relationships.As a microbial ecologist, I have studied the metabolism, systematics, evolution, and ecology of marine bacteria and viruses, specifically the Vibrionaceae and Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera pandemics.

VAlong with Dr. Nancy Jenkins, my long-term collaborator, we have exploited the power of genetics to model many different human diseases in mice. In our latest research, we showed that it is possible to mobilize Sleeping Beauty (SB), a "cut-and-paste" DNA transposon isolated from salmonoid fish, in mouse somatic cells, at frequencies high enough to induce hematopoietic cancer. Cancer results from SB insertional mutagenesis of cellular proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and the analysis of SB integrations sites from these tumors allowed us to identify a number of genes and signaling pathways important for the induction of hematopoietic cancer. More recently, in collaborative studies, we showed that we can also use SB transposition to model solid cancers in mice, by limiting the sites where SB transposition occurs. This genetic resource, combined with recent advances in cloning and sequencing technology, which now makes it possible to clone and sequence million of SB integrations sites from mouse tumors in a single day, affords an opportunity to analyze the mouse cancer genome in a way not possible before and, perhaps, identify new therapeutic targets for the treatment of human cancer.Along with Dr. Nancy Jenkins, my long-term collaborator, we have exploited the power of genetics to model many different human diseases in mice.

VIn my research I focus on the properties of ultra-cold atomic gases. My group has used laser-cooling and magnetic-trapping techniques to cool samples of rubidium vapor through the transition temperature for Bose Einstein condensation (BEC), well under a microkelvin. The individual atoms in a BEC all share exactly the same quantum wavefunction and their behavior exhibits a coherent nature very analogous to that of photons in a laser beam. BEC is a superfluid and the viscosity and topological properties of the gas can be counter-intuitive. The emphasis in my group has begun to shift towards exploring applications of BEC. In particular, Bose condensates may prove to be exquisitely sensitive probes of gravitational fields, of rotation, and possibly of exotic short-range forces.In my research I focus on the properties of ultra-cold atomic gases.

VMy research focuses on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying establishment and persistence of a bacterial infection. We use as a model Listeria monocytogenes, which is responsible for a food borne disease resulting in gastro-enteritis, meningitidis and materno-fetal infections. We study the bacterium and the host at the cell, tissue and animal level. Our research has led to the identification of a number of virulence factors including ActA, a protein responsible for intracellular actin-based motility and widely used to study actin polymerization. We have dissected the mechanisms allowing bacterial entry into cells, identified the two main bacterial proteins involved, i.e. internalin and InlB and discovered a species-specificity which has led us to generate the first transgenic mice expressing the human receptor. We then deciphered the contribution of internalin and InlB in the crossing of the intestinal and placental barriers. We showed that Listeria manipulate the host epigenetic information by controlling histone modifications through the action of listeriolysin O, a mechanism which down regulates immmunity genes. Using tiling arrays, we described two successive global transcriptional switches which occur during infection, a series of small RNAs -among which two are involved in virulence- and unexpected features such as long non-translated antisense transcripts. We discovered a new role for riboswitches as trans-acting small RNAs. Our research continues to focus on these different aspects and on post-translational modification induced by Listeria in infected cells.My research focuses on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying establishment and persistence of a bacterial infection.

VAs a cell biologist and cardiologist, I have studied signaling mechanisms that are important in cardiovascular biology and disease. Thrombin, a coagulation protease that is generated at sites of vascular injury, is perhaps the most potent activator of blood platelets, the cells that clump together to prevent bleeding from damaged blood vessels. Thrombin and platelets play a central role in thrombosis, the process that causes most heart attacks and strokes. My laboratory initially focused on the question of how a protease like thrombin can act like a hormone to regulate the behavior of platelets and other cells. We found that thrombin and related proteases can trigger cellular responses via a small family of G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs). PARs are in essence peptide receptors that carry their own ligands, which remain cryptic until unmasked by proteolytic cleavage of the receptor. Studies of human platelets and PAR knockout mice suggest that PARs are necessary for activation of platelets by thrombin and important in hemostasis and thrombosis. PAR1 may be a rational target for novel drugs aimed at the prevention or treatment of thrombosis. PARs also mediate responses to proteases in endothelial cells and other cell types that may contribute to inflammation and repair after tissue injury. Thus, the coagulation cascade and PARs together provide a mechanism for sensing vascular damage or leak and orchestrating appropriate cellular responses. In an interesting surprise, PARs also appear to play a role in embryonic development in new blood vessel formation and other processes. A current focus of my laboratory is defining the exact role of PARs and the G protein signaling pathways they activate in this context.As a cell biologist and cardiologist, I have studied signaling mechanisms that are important in cardiovascular biology and disease.

PAR1 may be a rational target for novel drugs aimed at the prevention or treatment of thrombosis. PARs also mediate responses to proteases in endothelial cells and other cell types that may contribute to inflammation and repair after tissue injury. Thus, the coagulation cascade and PARs together provide a mechanism for sensing vascular damage or leak and orchestrating appropriate cellular responses. In an interesting surprise, PARs also appear to play a role in embryonic development in new blood vessel formation and other processes. A current focus of my laboratory is defining the exact role of PARs and the G protein signaling pathways they activate in this context.As a cell biologist and cardiologist, I have studied signaling mechanisms that are important in cardiovascular biology and disease. Thrombin, a coagulation protease that is generated at sites of vascular injury, is perhaps the most potent activator of blood platelets, the cells that clump together to prevent bleeding from damaged blood vessels. Thrombin and platelets play a central role in thrombosis, the process that causes most heart attacks and strokes. My laboratory initially focused on the question of how a protease like thrombin can act like a hormone to regulate the behavior of platelets and other cells. We found that thrombin and related proteases can trigger cellular responses via a small family of G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs). PARs are in essence peptide receptors that carry their own ligands, which remain cryptic until unmasked by proteolytic cleavage of the receptor.

VMy research interests lie in the molecular and cell biology of mammalian zinc metabolism and function, which evolved from an interest in both biochemistry and nutritional sciences. My laboratory has delineated the regulation of zinc metabolism by hormones and cytokines along with those signals provided by the dietary zinc supply. These stimuli also regulate expression of metallothionein, a zinc-trafficking protein, which coordinates cellular zinc distribution. Immunological and polymerase chain reaction-based assays have been developed and are being used to examine metallothionein gene expression in humans for zinc nutritional assessment studies and for correlations with specific diseases. We are also investigating zinc transporter proteins to characterize their molecular regulation and roles in the integrative metabolism of zinc. My laboratory is also identifying zinc-responsive genes to establish the molecular basis of the dietary essentiality of this micronutrient. Using transgenic mice and other experimental models, we are also studying cysteine-rich intestinal protein, a prototype zinc finger protein, to characterize how it exchanges zinc with conjugate zinc-donating partners, including metallothionein.My research interests lie in the molecular and cell biology of mammalian zinc metabolism and function, which evolved from an interest in both biochemistry and nutritional sciences.

VI am interested in many of aspects of nature and how humans interact with these; consequently, my research interests are broad. Most of my research can be classified as "applied" in that it seeks to be user-inspired and embedded in a social process in order to enhance the likelihood of implementation. A smaller amount is driven by my own curiosity about nature; this I term "curiosity research". My applied research focuses on: (i) conservation assessment, planning and implementation, (ii) identifying, valuing and mainstreaming the safeguarding of ecosystem services and (iii) fire ecology of fynbos (mediterranaen scrub) ecosystems. Most of my curiosity research deals with the evolutionary ecology of the Greater Cape Floristic Region (fynbos, succulent karoo and subtropical thicket). Here I have highlighted the role of historical factors (especially climatic stability) in explaining the "uniqueness" of diversity patterns in the flora, both in a regional and a global context.I am interested in many of aspects of nature and how humans interact with these; consequently, my research interests are broad.

VI am a physicist interested both in experiment and in theory, and enjoy working with my colleagues and students. With torsion balances, we have tested Einstein's equivalence principle, searched for new forces weaker than gravity, and measured the Casimir force. With mass-spectrometric methods we measured the lifetimes of the 128Te and 130Te for double-beta decay, the longest ever to be measured, and there from deduced the limits on the Majorana mass of the neutrinos. Theoretically, my focus is on astrophysics and cosmology, especially their interconnections with basic physics. We have investigated how, particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, how they are transported through interstellar and intergalactic space, emit secondary radiations, and give rise to phenomena like cosmic rays, supernova remnants, pulsars and quasars. We calculated the flux of cosmic-ray neutrinos and formulated strategies for the study of neutrino-interactions in underground laboratories. In the context of the hot big bang origin for the universe, we could calculate the present-day number-density of neutrinos and other weekly interacting neutral particles, and thence derived strict bounds on their rest mass - either less than a few eV or greater than a few GeV. The consequences of near saturation of these bounds are dramatic: these particles will constitute 'dark matter' in the universe, which gravitationally dominates over the normal matter in the formation and dynamics of the galaxies, generically forming invisible halos around galactic systems and thus providing an explanation for the virial discrepancy and rotation curves of galactic systems. These considerations stimulated the now vibrant field of astroparticle physics.I am a physicist interested both in experiment and in theory, and enjoy working with my colleagues and students.

VI am a plant biologist and paleontologist interested primarily in the diversity and evolutionary history of plant life. A major component of my work has been the careful comparison of fossil plants with their living relatives to understand how different groups of plants are interrelated and have changed through time. A particular focus has been the study of exquisitely preserved fossil flowers and understanding their relevance for interpreting the diversification of flowering plants, which today are the most diverse of all groups of plants, with more than 300,000 living species. I have also worked on the initial colonization of the land by plants as they made the transition from a purely aquatic to land-based existence. My current interests focus on large-scale patterns in the history and diversity of living plants. Through directing the science programs at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in the United Kingdom I am also increasingly concerned with how plant diversity can best be conserved for the future and how it can be used in sustainable ways for human benefit.I am a plant biologist and paleontologist interested primarily in the diversity and evolutionary history of plant life.

VMy major interest is in antigen processing, defined as the combination of mechanisms that generate the complexes of class I and class II MHC molecules with peptides that are the targets for recognition by T lymphocytes. My colleagues and I have identified a number of proteins that collaborate in these processes. MHC class I peptide binding occurs in the context of a large complex that we have defined in the endoplasmic reticulum consisting of TAP, an ATP-dependent peptide transporter; tapasin, a protein that couples the transporter to assembling class I molecules; and two "house-keeping" chaperones, calreticulin and ERp57. How these accessory molecules combine to facilitate peptide binding is currently being intensively investigated. We have also studied MHC class II peptide binding through the mechanism of class II molecules being delivered into the endocytic pathway by an associated protein, the invariant chain. This has included study of the CLIP, a residual fragment of the invariant chain, and the catalysis actions of a related protein called DM. Recently, we also identified a thiol reductase called GILT, which facilitates the generation of class II-binding peptides from protein antigens rich in disulfide bonds.My major interest is in antigen processing, defined as the combination of mechanisms that generate the complexes of class I and class II MHC molecules with peptides that are the targets for recognition by T lymphocytes.

We have placed particular emphasis on vibrations and how they determine the rate and pathway of a reaction. Using lasers, we have been able to monitor the flow of energy within or between molecules, as well as determine the final quantum states of the products. Ultrafast lasers have allowed us to extend this same process from gases into liquids, where the interactions with the solvent influence the flow of energy and the reactions and, in favorable cases, control the outcome of a reaction using laser excitation of selected vibrations.With the assistance of my graduate students and postdoctoral associates, I have explored chemical reactions in both gases and liquid, with the goal of understanding the motions and configurations of molecules during chemical transformation.

VI am an environmental economist whose research has focused on valuing non-market benefits associated with environmental improvements-primarily health benefits, such as increases in life expectancy associated with reductions in air and water pollution, and reductions risk of chronic illness associated with improvements in air quality. Some of this research has been theoretical-analyzing how the value of reductions in risk of death should vary over the life cycle-and some empirical-attempting to estimate what people will pay for reductions in their risk of dying, and to see how these values vary with a person's age and how far in the future the risk reduction occurs. These estimates are used in cost-benefit analyses of health and safety regulations by the USEPA and other agencies. Another strand of my research has analyzed regulatory decisions issued by the USEPA to infer the value of lives saved implicit in these regulations. In many cases, these values are much greater than what individuals would themselves pay for risk reductions. Other research has focused on inferring the value of environmental amenities from housing prices and from migration decisions. More recently, I have analyzed preferences for environmental and safety improvements in developing countries.I am an environmental economist whose research has focused on valuing non-market benefits associated with environmental improvements-primarily health benefits, such as increases in life expectancy associated with reductions in air and water pollution, and reductions risk of chronic illness associated with improvements in air quality.

VI endeavor to understand the genetic and biochemical bases of pathogenicity of Salmonella typhimurium, S. typhi, S. paratyphi A, and Escherichia coli. Emphasis is on understanding the genetic control over persistence in and transmissibility from the ambient environment, attachment to and persistence on eukaryotic surfaces (colonization), invasion of and persistence and multiplication in tissues, and host specificity. Studies are in progress to understand how genes for virulence properties are regulated in response to ambient environmental stresses and to different compartments in the infected eukaryotic host. Other studies use attenuated Salmonella strains expressing virulence determinants (i.e., protective antigens) from other pathogens as vectors to home to the nasal-, bronchial- and gut-associated lymphoid tissues and induce mucosal, systemic, and cellular immunity to the pathogen whose virulence antigens are expressed by the recombinant vaccine strain. Research to improve these recombinant attenuated Salmonella antigen and DNA vaccine delivery vectors is in progress to either enhance Th1-dependent cellular immune responses or Th2-dependent humoral and mucosal immune responses. Vaccines are being designed with biological containment features to preclude their survival in nature. Various cell types, animals, and humans are used for the analysis of virulence, the immune response, and protective immunity.I endeavor to understand the genetic and biochemical bases of pathogenicity of Salmonella typhimurium, S. typhi, S. paratyphi A, and Escherichia coli.

VMy research concerns the perception of spoken language. Babies are born with the mental equipment to acquire language, but with no specific knowledge of what the environmental language will be like, and languages differ in all aspects of linguistic structure: the repertoire of speech sounds they use, how they construct words, the rules of their grammar, and so on. Because babies can acquire, without specific instruction, any language they hear, it might seem that the mental processes involved in speaking and listening to language should be universal. But, beginning with the discovery that adult listeners use language-specific strategies in segmenting continuous speech into its component words, my research has established that adult language processes differ substantially across languages. The segmentation differences, we discovered, have their source in early infant listening experience, and the construction of an initial vocabulary. Building on this foundation, our research program has gradually uncovered how the universal substrate of language processing abilities with which we are born is gradually shaped by the structure of the mother tongue, leading to adult listening performance which is optimized for the native language (but with the downside that adult listening can then be far from optimal with foreign languages).My research concerns the perception of spoken language.

Building on this foundation, our research program has gradually uncovered how the universal substrate of language processing abilities with which we are born is gradually shaped by the structure of the mother tongue, leading to adult listening performance which is optimized for the native language (but with the downside that adult listening can then be far from optimal with foreign languages).

VI am interested in understanding the plant immune system and in also understanding how pathogens have adapted to circumvent it. We study the function of proteins encoded by "plant disease resistance genes". Most of these fall into a class of proteins that has related members which function in animal innate immunity. They are, in essence, the receptors that "recognize" pathogen encoded molecules from pathogens as diverse in life history as viruses, fungi, bacteria and aphids. The fact that this single class of proteins can condition resistance to all of these pests was the first evidence that plants have a dedicated immune receptor family. Despite their appearance as "receptors", we provided evidence supporting a novel mode of activation for the plant immune system, termed the "Guard Hypothesis". Here, the plant immune receptors do not directly recognize pathogen virulence factors as ligands, but rather recognize the action of those pathogen virulence factors on intracellular host targets. Thus, activation of the plant immune system is akin to that of animal immune systems, where "modified self" can be recognized to trigger an appropriate response. We are now concerned with understanding how pathogen virulence factors suppress plant immune function an dhow both partners evolve and adapt to each other's presence.I am interested in understanding the plant immune system and in also understanding how pathogens have adapted to circumvent it.

VRNA, the blueprint for proteins, is made in all cells by a complex molecular machine, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase through a process called transcription. My research explores the mechanism and regulation of transcription, primarily in bacteria. We determine the three-dimensional structures of RNA polymerase and other associated proteins using X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy. We combine these studies with biophysical, biochemical, and genetic approaches to understand how transcription and, by extension, gene expression are controlled.RNA, the blueprint for proteins, is made in all cells by a complex molecular machine, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase through a process called transcription.

VMy research is in the areas of quantum optics and quantum information. I am especially enthusiastic about proposing experiments that probe subtle aspects of the quantum world. More specifically, I have been interested in the role of the environment on the dynamics of several systems. This has involved work on atomic decay, laser and micromaser dynamics, trapped ions, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and entanglement. Interaction with an environment leads to loss of quantum features, a phenomenon known as decoherence. I am particularly interested in the effect of the environment in connection to the classical limit of quantum mechanics, including chaotic systems, and worked on proposals of experiments on decoherence and for measuring the quantum state of a field in a cavity, which have actually been implemented at Ecole Normale Superieure, in Paris. More recently, I have been involved in the realization of experiments in the quantum optics lab at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, investigating, with twin-photon beams, the detection of entanglement and the relation between local and global dynamics under the action of different kinds of environment.My research is in the areas of quantum optics and quantum information.

VThe overall theme of my research is to combine synthetic chemistry with analytical engineering problem solving to design and create new materials for applications in the physical and life sciences. Two general areas of study currently under investigation are: (i) the assembly of inorganic or organic-inorganic hybrid solids that perform molecular recognition, catalysis and proton/ion conduction, and (ii) the synthesis of new polymers for the delivery of macromolecular therapeutics such as nucleic acids. We investigate generalized concepts of self-assembly between organic and inorganic precursors to learn how to control the assembly of materials with desired structures and functions.  Additionally, we take a systems approach to constructing functional materials and this has provided interesting new solutions to the design and synthesis of intelligent therapeutics, some of which have now reached human clinical trials.The overall theme of my research is to combine synthetic chemistry with analytical engineering problem solving to design and create new materials for applications in the physical and life sciences.

In the latter case I have been investigating the evolution of quantum dots involving surface diffusion, capillarity, and strong anisotropic crystalline properties, and secondly the growth of nano-wires by catalytic crystal growth.

VThe goal of research in my laboratory is the understanding of molecular events underlying biogenesis and traffic of intracellular membranous organelles. Much of my work is focused on the neuronal synapse, where neurotransmitter containing secretory vesicles (synaptic vesicles) mediate fast chemical transmission. The abundance of these vesicles in brain, and the precise physiological effect produced by their secretion, make them a powerful model organelle for studies of fundamental mechanisms in membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, membrane fusion, and membrane budding. Using in vivo and in vitro systems, as well as cell-free approaches, my laboratory has helped elucidate pathways of synaptic vesicle recycling, identified and/or characterized several nerve terminal-enriched proteins that participate in this recycling and established a critical role in synaptic vesicle biogenesis of interactions between cytosolic proteins and phospholipids of the membrane bilayer. In addition to contributing to a better understanding of synaptic transmission and to the general fields of secretion and endocytosis, my studies on synaptic vesicle dynamics have had an impact in the field of neuroimmunology. I have found that some synaptic vesicle-associated proteins are autoantigens in neurological and endocrine disorders and have established the autoimmune origin of Stiff-Man syndrome.The goal of research in my laboratory is the understanding of molecular events underlying biogenesis and traffic of intracellular membranous organelles.

VThe linear chromosomes of eukaryotes pose two fundamental problems. Because the universal DNA replication strategy fails to copy chromosome ends, they require a specialized duplication mechanism. The second problem originates from the DNA damage response. As the continuity of life depends on mechanisms to detect and repair lesions in DNA, cells must have the ability to distinguish their natural chromosome ends from sites of DNA damage. The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes carry specific elements, telomeres, that mediate both the replication and protection of the terminal DNA. My goal is to understand how telomeres work. Our biochemical and cell biological studies on mammalian cells have identified a protein complex, shelterin, that binds telomeres but not other DNA ends. We found that shelterin is required for the normal duplication of chromosome ends and also protects the ends from the DNA damage response. Collaborative work with Dr. Jack Griffith (UNC, Chapel Hill) has revealed that telomeres form a higher order structure (the t-loop) in which the chromosome end is sequestered. We have proposed that t-loops represent an architectural solution to several of the problems of chromosome ends. Insights into the basic biology of telomeres have medical relevance since telomere dysfunction is implicated in aging and cancer.The linear chromosomes of eukaryotes pose two fundamental problems.

Using satellite imagery as a lens to examine changes in the land surface over large areas, one aspect of my work aims to quantify the implications of these changes for climate through carbon and other fluxes to the atmosphere. Observations of the Earth from space have transformed the ability to identify changes in forest cover, urbanization, and other anthropogenic processes and to develop models that capture fluxes of water, energy, and gases between the land and atmosphere. More recently my work has focused in the tropics and has included the relationship between land use change and biodiversity.

I have been interested in understanding such machinery; that is, macromolecular complexes including viruses, enzyme complexes, the cytoskeleton, and the prokaryotic chemosensory apparatus. My underlying assumption is that visualizing the structure of the machinery is an essential part of determining mechanism. That assumption has motivated my efforts to improve the methodology of electron microscopy, a method ideally suited to visualize such machinery. Electron microscopy bridges the resolution gap between high-resolution methods such as x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, on the one hand and lower-resolution methods such as light microscopy on the other.

VMy work focuses on how the environment influences the timing of flowering, the switch from vegetative to reproductive development in plants. Using the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana we have combined genetics and molecular techniques to define the pathways regulating the switch to flowering. We have studied how this transition is promoted by prolonged cold, a process known as vernalization. Our work has revealed that plants 'remember' they have experienced winter through a conserved Polycomb chromatin mechanism. We have also discovered novel functions for RNA processing components in chromatin silencing mechanisms and elaborated co-transcriptional mechanisms linking RNA processing and stability with transcription. We are continuing to dissect the different facets of vernalization with the goal of generating a quantitative model that reveals how the chromatin silencing is induced by low temperature and how individual components of the chromatin silencing network are integrated into a robust whole. We are also examining the evolution of the flowering pathways and defining the molecular variation that has enabled Arabidopsis accessions to adapt to growth in a wide range of climates. Our findings have implications for epigenetic silencing, co-transcriptional regulation and molecular evolution in many organisms.My work focuses on how the environment influences the timing of flowering, the switch from vegetative to reproductive development in plants. Using the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana we have combined genetics and molecular techniques to define the pathways regulating the switch to flowering. We have studied how this transition is promoted by prolonged cold, a process known as vernalization. Our work has revealed that plants 'remember' they have experienced winter through a conserved Polycomb chromatin mechanism.

VMy home is algebraic geometry, a discipline connected to many others; wherever polynomials appear, it can be there to provide a geometric understanding. For instance: diophantine equations (solutions of equations in integers or rationals), identities between integrals with algebraic integrands, algebraic groups. I am fascinated by the multiplicity of cohomology theories algebraic varieties give rise to, and their interrelation. I constructed one: mixed Hodge theory. Thanks to their properties, spaces and maps coming from algebraic geometry are very special. A grandiose theory of Grothendieck ("motives") makes sense of it, modulo conjectures which remain inaccessible. Some of my works give unconditional variants sufficients for some applications.

VMy research has focused on the biosynthesis of the rigid walls that surround the cells of higher plants. Special emphasis was placed on the biosynthesis of cellulose, a major component of the plant cell wall and the world's most abundant organic compound. Cellulose is a polymer comprised of many units of the simple sugar glucose, and, although relatively simple in structure, it has been proven difficult to isolate and characterize the enzymes responsible for its synthesis. My laboratory was the first to isolate and characterize a gene from plants that encodes the catalytic subunit of the cellulose synthase, the enzyme responsible for glucan chain polymerization. We've also contributed to the understanding of the biochemistry of the process, most recently by showing that sterol glucosides can serve as primers for cellulose synthesis and by studying the mode of action of herbicides that inhibit the process. Since 2002, I've taken up a new challenge that uses my scientific talents in a very different way by working for The Rockefeller Foundation's Food Security Program. In this new effort, I help set the Foundation's strategy for the effective use of biotechnology in support of their programs for crop improvement in the developing world.My research has focused on the biosynthesis of the rigid walls that surround the cells of higher plants.

VAs a marine microbiologist, I have focused my research efforts on the behavior of Bacteria (and recently Archaea) in extreme environments, especially deep-sea and polar environments. I have used a combination of modeling and experimental approaches, in the field and laboratory, to explore the limits of microbial life and fundamentals of survival and proliferation under conditions of extreme temperatures, pressures and recently salt concentrations (as in winter sea-ice brines). The belief that what can be measured of microbial behavior in situ best instructs the design of modeling and laboratory experiments continues to guide my research. My laboratory has documented the ecological importance of pressure-adapted bacteria throughout the deep ocean, at both cold and hot (hydrothermal-vent) temperatures, and of cold- and salt-adapted bacteria in the high Arctic. Association with a solid matrix (sediments, particle aggregates, ice), and thus with the strategy of producing extracellular enzymes (to acquire dissolved organic sources of energy) and polysaccharides (for osmo- and cyroprotection), repeatedly emerges as critical to competitive performance under extreme physical conditions. We are currently using Colwellia psychrerythraea strain 34H, the first cold-adapted organism (highly motile in a glycerol solution at -10 degrees C) for which a whole-genome sequence is available, as our model organism for testing the lower temperature and other limits for microbial life on Earth and possibly elsewhere.As a marine microbiologist, I have focused my research efforts on the behavior of Bacteria (and recently Archaea) in extreme environments, especially deep-sea and polar environments.

VMy interest in insect biology has focused on the mechanisms used by insects to regulate seasonal development and reproduction.  Significant portions of the year are unsuitable for continuous development, thus most insects enter periods of dormancy (diapause) to circumvent these inimical periods.  My laboratory has examined the environmental cues used by insects to monitor seasonal changes, the hormonal signals that dictate the seasonal patterns, and more recently, the gene expression patterns that regulate this developmental arrest.  The low temperatures of winter present one of the most formidable challenges that the dormant, overwintering insect confronts.  We have identified important roles for stress proteins (heat shock proteins) in preventing low temperature injury and retarding water loss during diapause.  The model organism we have used for many of our studies is the flesh fly, but associated experiments have examined diapause mechanisms in mosquitoes and agriculturally-important moths.  Recent experiments in Antarctica have begun to explore physiological adaptations that enable a midge to live in this extreme terrestrial environment. Through the years, I have also been engaged in research in Africa that is directed toward disruption of the pregnancy cycle in the tsetse fly, the vector of African sleeping sickness.My interest in insect biology has focused on the mechanisms used by insects to regulate seasonal development and reproduction.

VAs a glacial geologist I study the record of former large ice sheets and mountain-glacier complexes. This record affords insights about the dynamics of such ice masses throughout the Cenozoic and especially during the last few ice-age cycles. I have concentrated my recent research on two major problems. The first concerns the development of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, with particular emphasis on the sensitivity of this sheet to climatic warning. The second problem concerns the origin of the abrupt climate changes that so dominated the last glacial cycle. My contribution to understanding abrupt change involves a Southern Hemisphere perspective. Whether abrupt changes are synchronous in the two polar hemispheres is a key to deciphering their cause. To that end I investigate former mountain snowline changes on the Southern Alps of New Zealand and the Andes of South America.As a glacial geologist I study the record of former large ice sheets and mountain-glacier complexes.

VI am interested in how plant functional traits are affected by environmental drivers and affect ecosystem properties and their derived societal benefits. I have a long-standing interest in broad-scale comparative ecology, including the testing for recurrent patterns of plant trait specialization across floras and ecosystems. In the 1990s I began studying the effects of global change drivers, in particular elevated dioxide and land use change, on terrestrial ecosystems. Using an experimental synthetic-community approach, I provided early empirical evidence that complex interactions and feedbacks involving plants, soil organisms and herbivores with different functional traits can influence the effects of global change on ecosystems. Subsequently I became interested in how biological communities affect ecosystem properties and their derived benefits. I have investigated this using field removal experiments, and also ecosystems shaped by different land use regimes. I have recently contributed to the theory of functional biodiversity and its application to the study and management of real ecosystems in the field. Together with colleagues from different areas of knowledge, I am now working on the development of ecological and social tools to analyze the origin and maintenance of functional diversity, and the links between its components and various ecosystem benefits provided to societies.I am interested in how plant functional traits are affected by environmental drivers and affect ecosystem properties and their derived societal benefits.

VMy research on the social life of monkeys and apes was initially purely observational, following the long-standing Dutch ethological tradition. I would watch the spontaneous behavior of primates for thousands of hours, collecting systematic information on the way they treat each other. In those days, in the 1970s, the main interest of many scholars was aggressive behavior, but soon I discovered that what happens after conflict is at least as important. Chimpanzees, for example, reconcile with a kiss and embrace after a fight. This led to research on conflict-resolution, expressions of empathy, cooperation, and ultimately the foundations of human morality. In pursuing this interest, I have studied many captive populations of primates, from macaques and capuchins to bonobos and chimpanzees, always with a strong comparative component, including parallels with human behavior. Lately, my team has become more experimental in its approach. We explore the same social issues by exposing primates to tightly controlled situations in which we manipulate certain variables. Our main topics of research are cultural learning (learning from others, which may lead to intergroup differences in behavior known as "cultures") and behavioral economics, which addresses social reciprocity, fairness, food-sharing, and the anticipation of benefits.My research on the social life of monkeys and apes was initially purely observational, following the long-standing Dutch ethological tradition.

This led to research on conflict-resolution, expressions of empathy, cooperation, and ultimately the foundations of human morality. In pursuing this interest, I have studied many captive populations of primates, from macaques and capuchins to bonobos and chimpanzees, always with a strong comparative component, including parallels with human behavior. Lately, my team has become more experimental in its approach. We explore the same social issues by exposing primates to tightly controlled situations in which we manipulate certain variables. Our main topics of research are cultural learning (learning from others, which may lead to intergroup differences in behavior known as "cultures") and behavioral economics, which addresses social reciprocity, fairness, food-sharing, and the anticipation of benefits.

VI am interested in the comparative analysis of frog development. We investigate the development of frogs native to Ecuador, instead of working with the model organism, the frog Xenopus laevis. We analyzed the strategies of reproduction, oogenesis and early development of the marsupial frogs, in particular the marsupial frog Gastrotheca riobambae. The reproductive adaptations of the mother and embryos of G. riobambae differ from frogs with aquatic reproduction and resemble the strategies of the birds and mammals, although some features remain frog-like. The developmental strategies of the dendrobatid frog Colostethus machalilla is also used for comparison. The marsupial frogs carry the embryos inside the body of the female and the dedrobatid frog C. machalilla deposits the eggs on the ground, and the father guards the nest until tadpole hatching, when he transports the tadpoles into the water, instead of the aquatic mode of Xenopus reproduction. Development in both of these frogs occurs more slowly than in Xenopus. We consider that slow development provides a new tool to investigate the flow of morphology and molecular events in early frog development. Our recent work concentrates in the analysis of gastrulation. The comparison of development is done using cytological and molecular techniques.I am interested in the comparative analysis of frog development.

VMy research focuses on developing a process-based understanding of landscape form and evolution.  We are seeking fundamental expressions or "laws" that can be used in a conservation of mass equation to explain landscape morphology and dynamics.   My research group has proposed rate laws for soil production from bedrock, transport of soil on hillslopes, and incision into bedrock by rivers and debris flows. This work involves field studies, physical modeling, and the development of theory.  We use digital elevation data to link landscape morphology and process laws, as well as to estimate the spatial variation in the potential for shallow landslides.  My group is now examining high-resolution topographic data from airborne laser altimetry; such data are providing the field with the first opportunity to make these linkages over large areas.  River channels cut valleys, convey sediment, and constitute crucial habitat.  We have studies underway on debris flow channel incision mechanics on Earth and Mars, channel formation by sediment laden flows into still water, floodplain formation, sediment transport in steep channels, and the linkages between land use and channel characteristics important to river life.My research focuses on developing a process-based understanding of landscape form and evolution.

VI developed the 'HP lattice model' of proteins. With it, we have explored the hypothesis that the protein folding code is mainly a binary solvation code.  I have been interested in the puzzle of how small proteins fold so quickly. Using simplified models, I found that fast folding can be explained by a mechanism of zipping and assembly; i.e., local structures form first, and nonlocal structures form later. My former students and I and others are developing foldamers, such as peptoids, as antimicrobials and for other applications. Seeking a simple model that could explain many of the properties of water, we have developed the Mercedez-Benz model, and studied how water interacts with hydrophobic solutes and ions. And, in recent work with Rob Phillips, I am exploring a principle called `Maximum Caliber', for explaining the dynamical noise properties of very small systems in biology and nanotechnology.I developed the 'HP lattice model' of proteins.

VI have always been fascinated by nature, and early in my life I chose to study biology. As an undergraduate, I was trained as a plant ecologist in Mexico. As a graduate student, I developed my interests on the evolutionary ecology of plant-animal interactions and this remains as one of main lines of research interest. In this field I started by studying the evolution of anti-herbivore, defensive mechanisms of plants in British meadows. In particular I did experiments and observations to understand how/why some plants have evolved the cyanogenic capacity (the production of hydrogen cyanide upon damage by herbivores) and the implications of such plant traits for coevolutionary responses of both plants and animals. In Mexico I have been doing studies along those lines in plants from tropical ecosystems. My work in tropical ecology has involved dozens of students. As a researcher in tropical ecology I have become aware of the tremendous anthropogenic impact on tropical rain forest ecosystems and my current lines of research include the study of the patterns of tropical deforestation, its consequences for biodiversity, and the disruption of ecological relationships of plants and animals in deforested and fragmented habitats. Within this field I have popularized the notion of "defaunation" to convey the view that tropical ecosystems are losing their medium/large animals at rates as dramatic as those of deforestation. My current work on conservation biology emphasizes the need of amalgamating the traditional interests of the conservation of taxa with the increasingly needed conservation of ecological processes.I have always been fascinated by nature, and early in my life I chose to study biology.

VOur laboratory is interested in understanding the cellular processes controlled by reversible phosphorylation. A family of protein kinases and phosphatases (PTPases) play key roles in this regulation. Our studies have focused largely on the PTPases. In addition to studying the structure and function of the PTPases, we have been able to show that the bacteria responsible for the plague harbor a virulence factor, which is the most active PTPases ever described. We are extending these studies to understand the molecular mechanisms of additional bacteria virulence factors and their impact on cellular signal transduction pathways. Recently we studied the tumor suppressor gene PTEN that shares sequence identity with the PTPases. Our laboratory was the first to show that PTEN dephosphorylates the lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 activates the protein kinase AKT that plays a critical role in modulating the balance between cell survival and programmed cell death. The loss of the PTEN gene elevates PIP3 levels, leading to constitutive activation by AKT, which stimulates cell survival and in turn leads to oncogenesis. We are also attempting to identify other PTPases, which function in the regulation of phosyphatidylinositol hydrolysis.Our laboratory is interested in understanding the cellular processes controlled by reversible phosphorylation.

VAs a plant biochemist, I have been intrigued for many years by how plants elaborate such a staggering variety of natural products. Recent advances in genomics provide the blueprint for this remarkable ability, but assigning functions to the multitude of genes involved in natural product biosynthesis requires an integrated combination of chemistry, biochemistry, genomics and genetics. Putting these pieces together has introduced me to new disciplines and, more importantly, to interesting new people who bring new perspectives to a problem I could only partly comprehend as a young faculty member starting my career at the University of London. Using the above multidisciplinary approaches, my group has helped decipher the biochemical pathways leading to flavonoids, isoflavonoids, proanthocyanidins and lignin. A second and more recently realized passion has been in the application of basic discoveries in the field of plant secondary metabolism to agricultural enhancement and the dietary prevention of human diseases through metabolic engineering. I am hopeful that work I started more than 20 years ago on the biosynthesis of lignin and flavonoids will soon lead to development of more nutritious forages, dedicated bioenergy crops, and plants or plant derived-products that provide long term protection against chronic disease.As a plant biochemist, I have been intrigued for many years by how plants elaborate such a staggering variety of natural products.

VUnderstanding the genetic basis of morphological evolution is a fundamental challenge for plant evolutionary biologists. How many genes contribute to the evolution of a new trait? What types of genes are involved? Do the alterations in these genes affect protein function or gene expression? Research in my laboratory addresses these and related questions using maize and its wild relatives as a model system. Specifically, my associates and I seek to unravel the genetic events responsible for the morphological evolution (or domestication) of maize from its wild ancestor, teosinte. I became interested in this question because I was fascinated by the fact that maize and teosinte show dramatic morphological differences even though maize was derived from teosinte less than 10,000 years ago. Another area of research in my laboratory is on the evolution of the maize genome. Plant genomes are the end products of long, complex evolutionary histories. My laboratory is trying to understand how such forces as selection, mutation, genetic drift, and polyploidy have shaped the maize genome by studying the patterns of nucleotide variation in maize genes and microsatellites.Understanding the genetic basis of morphological evolution is a fundamental challenge for plant evolutionary biologists.

VMy research interests lie in the area of mathematics bordering geometry, topology, and analysis and having substantial connections with mathematical physics. Much of my early work hinged on the application of the instanton solutions of the Yang-Mills equations--first introduced in particle physics--as tools to solve purely mathematical problems about the topology of four-dimensional manifolds. This has led to novel and wide-ranging results, not obtainable by other methods, that give a glimpse of the special nature of four-dimensional topology and geometry. More recently my work in this direction has focused on the special class of symplectic manifolds. I have shown that certain classical techniques from complex algebraic geometry can be adapted to this setting and am currently pursuing the implications of this for the classification of symplectic manifolds. Another theme running through my research is the study of certain partial differential equations arising in complex differential geometry. In the 1980s I worked on equations related to holomorphic vector bundles and have recently been studying the application of similar ideas to Kahler metrics.My research interests lie in the area of mathematics bordering geometry, topology, and analysis and having substantial connections with mathematical physics.

VUnderstanding patterns and processes of evolution at the cellular and molecular level has been the goal of my work since the middle 1970s, both experimentally and at the level of evolutionary theory. Experimental work has included (1) testing the endosymbiont hypothesis for the origin of plastids from cyanobacteria; (2) comparative studies on cyanobacterial molecular biology and metabolism; (3) development and exploitation of tools for manipulation and mapping of genomes of archaea; (4) reconstructing early events in the phylogeny and genomic evolution of eukaryotes through sequencing representative genes, and (5) documenting and assessing the significance of lateral gene transfer in prokaryotic adaptation and diversification.  Theoretical concerns, explored both computationally and conceptually over the last 30 years, include (1) the "selfish DNA" hypothesis as a general explanation for the presence in many genomes of excess repetitive DNA; (2) the antiquity of spliceosomal introns, and in particular whether these interruptions were present in the earliest genomes; (3) non-adaptationist explanations for molecular and cellular complexity; and (4) practical and philosophical implications of lateral gene transfer for microbial systematics, the ability to reconstruct ancestral genomes, and the significance of the "tree of life." I have recently become interested in and concerned about the impact of changes in the agendas of science funders on the quality of science.Understanding patterns and processes of evolution at the cellular and molecular level has been the goal of my work since the middle 1970s, both experimentally and at the level of evolutionary theory.

Theoretical concerns, explored both computationally and conceptually over the last 30 years, include (1) the "selfish DNA" hypothesis as a general explanation for the presence in many genomes of excess repetitive DNA; (2) the antiquity of spliceosomal introns, and in particular whether these interruptions were present in the earliest genomes; (3) non-adaptationist explanations for molecular and cellular complexity; and (4) practical and philosophical implications of lateral gene transfer for microbial systematics, the ability to reconstruct ancestral genomes, and the significance of the "tree of life."

VI have spent most of my career studying transposition and recombination, two main contributors to genetic variability in plants. Maize species diversity is manifested at all levels, ranging from plant shape to chromosomal structure. My lab recently discovered that the sequence of the same region of the genome can vary by as much as 70% between unrelated individuals. This unprecedented intraspecific variation in genome structure arises from differences in the content of intergenic transposable DNA elements (transposons), some of which most likely influence expression of the adjacent genes. Complementary variation in gene expression between unrelated lines may underlie the vigor seen in their hybrid progeny. The process of meiotic recombination shuffles chromosomal segments that otherwise would be inherited together. We found that recombination in maize is restricted to genes, which comprise a small fraction of the genome, and does not take place in the highly repetitive transposons. This pattern of recombination probably evolved as a mechanism to protect the genome from self-destruction at meiosis, when recombination is required for proper chromosomal disjunction. A few transposons are very active in maize. My lab studies their architecture and interactions, uses them as tools to elucidate gene function, and is engineering them to create a more efficient reverse genetics resource for the community.I have spent most of my career studying transposition and recombination, two main contributors to genetic variability in plants.

VMy research centers on determining the molecular structures of RNA molecules as the basis for understanding their biological function. There are three major areas of focus in my laboratory: catalytic RNA, the function of RNA in the signal recognition particle, and the mechanism of RNA-mediated internal initiation of protein synthesis. I am interested in comparing catalytic strategies used by RNA to those of protein enzymes, focusing on self-splicing introns and the self-cleaving RNA from hepatitis delta virus, a human pathogen. I am also investigating RNA-mediated initiation of protein synthesis, focusing on the internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) of RNA from hepatitis C virus. Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, and biochemical experiments are aimed at understanding the structure and mechanism of the IRES and its amazing ability to hijack the mammalian ribosome and associated translation factors. A third area of focus is the signal recognition particle, which contains a highly conserved RNA required for targeting proteins for export out of cells. Each of these projects seeks to understand the molecular basis for RNA function, using a combination of structural, biophysical, and biochemical approaches.My research centers on determining the molecular structures of RNA molecules as the basis for understanding their biological function.

VI am chemist who is trying to understand the molecules of the human brain. Our targets are the complex, integral membrane proteins found at the synapse, and our goal is to evaluate their structure and function with chemical-scale precision. Our major tool has been unnatural amino acid mutagenesis using the Xenopus oocyte expression system, coupled with electrophysiology. With this tool, we have been able to rationally modify neuroreceptors and ion channels in both very subtle and very dramatic ways and evaluate the impact of the modification on the function of the receptor or channel. A highlight has been the determination of the broad relevance of the cation- Pi interaction to drug-receptor interactions in neurobiology. The cation- Pi interaction is a powerful noncovalent binding force that was developed in our labs and that we have shown to be employed across all molecular sciences, from structural biology to materials science. In molecular neurobiology, we have shown that the cation-Pi interaction plays an important role in the function of receptors that respond to acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and glycine, as well as potassium and sodium channels. The cation-Pi interaction also plays a prominent role in nicotine addiction, provide a key binding interaction between nicotine and specific receptors in the brain.I am chemist who is trying to understand the molecules of the human brain.

VI am interested in all of the processes that occur in interstellar space, including studies of the structure of interstellar shock waves, but much of my attention has been focussed on trying to understand the properties of interstellar dust -- solid particles with sizes ranging from just a few Angstroms to about a micron. What are the shapes, sizes, and compositions of the articles? How do the particles absorb, scatter, and emit photons? How do the dust particles behave under the influence of interstellar radiation and magnetic fields, and collisions with gas atoms, ions, and electrons? What are the effects of the dust on the dynamics of the interstellar medium? These particles of interstellar dust turn out to play an important role in a very wide range of interstellar processes -- absorption, scattering and emission of photons; the formation of molecules; heating of the surrounding gas; and acceleration of the gas when the grains are driven through the gas by radiation pressure. We can't claim to comprehend the formation of galaxies until we understand the workings of interstellar dust. Progress in this field is critically dependent on observational data, but physical models are required to interpret these observations.I am interested in all of the processes that occur in interstellar space, including studies of the structure of interstellar shock waves, but much of my attention has been focussed on trying to understand the properties of interstellar dust -- solid particles with sizes ranging from just a few Angstroms to about a micron.

VChiefdoms are the earliest regional-scale, fundamentally hierarchical societies in human history. They have emerged independently in broadly similar ways in many parts of the world during the past 6,000 or 7,000 years, sometimes leading to political formations of yet larger scale and more hierarchical character, sometimes not. My research centers on the global comparative study of the origins and development of the novel community interaction structures that comprise chiefdoms, as the only convincing route to the articulation and empirical evaluation of models offering understanding of the processes that have repeatedly produced them and of the ways in which varying circumstances constrain those process and lead to remarkably varied expressions of a few central organizing principles. I have emphasized the importance of comparative study of large numbers of cases from widely separated regions and the development of quantitative analytical tools adequate to the recognition of the patterns in archeological data that make possible empirical characterization of prehistoric chiefdoms so that rival models can be evaluated against each other. I have collected archeological data in the field to document the trajectories of early chiefdom development, principally in the Valley of Oaxaca and the Tehuacan Valley of Mexico, the Alto Magdalena of Colombia, and the Chifeng region of Inner Mongolia, Peoples' Republic of China.Chiefdoms are the earliest regional-scale, fundamentally hierarchical societies in human history.

VAs a translational researcher and medical oncologist, I have studied activated tyrosine kinases and their role in signal transduction and cellular transformation and the application of this knowledge to cancer therapies. The BCR-ABL oncogene is our primary model system because of its central role in the pathogenesis of a human disease, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). As ABL tyrosine kinase activity is required for transformation by BCR-ABL, we evaluated a specific inhibitor of the ABL protein tyrosine kinase as a therapeutic agent for CML. This work identified imatinib (Gleevec) as having significant activity in pre-clinical and clinical studies, which led to it becoming the standard therapy for this disease. Additional pre-clinical profiling of this drug identified gastrointestinal stromal tumors as another potential disease for which imatinib is now the standard treatment. Further, our profiling of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in patients with CML and our evaluation of the structural basis of inhibition of ABL by imatinib allowed for the rapid identification of kinase mutations as the major cause of clinical resistance to imatinib. Using this information, we have evaluated several novel ABL inhibitors that are now available for patients with imatinib resistance. In related work, we are performing functional screens to identify other tyrosine kinases that may be therapeutic targets in other leukemias.As a translational researcher and medical oncologist, I have studied activated tyrosine kinases and their role in signal transduction and cellular transformation and the application of this knowledge to cancer therapies.

VAn early interest in oceanography led me to marine organisms, one of which used a circadian clock to control daily cycles of bioluminescence. This biological clock interested me, and to describe its mechanism I became a geneticist, focusing on the simplest eukaryotic circadian system, that of the filamentous fungus Neurospora. We cloned clock genes, carried out screens to identify clock components and clock regulated genes, and studied their regulation. To test the conceptual models that naturally arose, we developed new tools allowing manipulation of clock protein levels, demonstrating that the circadian oscillator comprised a cell-autonomous time-delayed transcriptional negative feedback loop wherein clock genes encoded proteins that fed back to reduce clock gene transcription; the chief conduit of clock output was through transcriptional regulation of clock-controlled genes encoding products that don't impact the feedback loop. Rapid light-induced transcription of a clock gene, mediated by a novel light-activated transcription factor, underlies resetting, and specific post-translational modifications of clock proteins underlies both the long period of the rhythm and temperature compensation. More recently, our work has expanded to include mice and mammalian cells in culture, and also to developing tools for high throughput gene knockouts that we have used for whole genome functional genomics.An early interest in oceanography led me to marine organisms, one of which used a circadian clock to control daily cycles of bioluminescence.

VAs a social anthropologist, I have developed two fundamental lines of study, one being social movements, and the other population movements. My initial interest in political anthropology and social history, which correspond to a first stage of my work, has had a decisive influence on the central thyme of my research since 1982, which is international migration with an interdisciplinary focus. I have collaborated with demographists and sociologists on the Mexican Migration Project, and the Latin American Migration Project. Threw these research projects it has been possible to create a reliable and public data base which supports the principal findings, discussions, and conclusions drawn from them.    My research on Mexican migration has led to: the identification and definition of stages of process; the relevance of social networks; the initiation of discussions on the use and impact of currency; the profile sketch of Mexican migrants at different moments threw the Twentieth Century; the analysis of change and continuity in the origins and destinations of migrants; the comparison of urban and rural migration; the discovery, description, and explanation of the migration phase which started from 1987; the analysis of the migration policies of United States and Mexico threw time.As a social anthropologist, I have developed two fundamental lines of study, one being social movements, and the other population movements.

VMy research in probability theory concerns problems that arise from ecology and genetics. In the case of ecology, this means the study of stochastic spatial models and how their properties differ from the homogeneously mixing situation, which is usually modeled by differential equations. Much of this work has been done in collaboration with Simon Levin at Princeton. In genetics, I have developed mathematical models to study the evolution of microsatellites, impacts of selective sweeps on genetic variation, genome rearrangement, gene duplication and gene regulation. The last topic, which can be thought of abstractly as waiting for some individual to accumulate k prespecified mutations, leads naturally to the study of multistage carcinogenesis and has interested me in the analysis of data generated by cancer genome projects.My research in probability theory concerns problems that arise from ecology and genetics.

VMy research concerns the overlap of economics and economic history, demography, sociology, and psychology: the American baby boom and bust, the worldwide transition from high to low mortality and fertility, the spread of modern economic growth throughout the world, and the effect of these developments on human well-being. Methodologically this work builds especially on the use of history and historical time series and in seeking explanation, attempts to incorporate within the framework of economic theory, concepts employed in other social sciences, such as relative deprivation, natural fertility, and hedonic adaptation. I am now studying changes in subjective well-being over the life cycle, applying the demographer's technique of cohort analysis to social survey data. The aim is to clarify the role in determining well-being of such circumstances as living levels, family life, health, job conditions, and personality, and the reasons for the paradoxical relation between income and subjective well-being. At a point in time there is a positive association between subjective well-being and size of income, but over time there is no improvement in subjective well-being as income increases.My research concerns the overlap of economics and economic history, demography, sociology, and psychology: the American baby boom and bust, the worldwide transition from high to low mortality and fertility, the spread of modern economic growth throughout the world, and the effect of these developments on human well-being.

VSince joining the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the year 2000, my laboratory has largely focused on functional genomic studies of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana and of human cells. We are especially interested in the identification and characterization of components in signal transduction pathways that regulate growth and development. A major focus of my laboratory has been aimed at the development of genome-wide approaches to interrogate gene functions including large collections of sequence-indexed mutations, whole genome tiling microarrays to functionally annotate the transcriptome and methylome and ultra-high throughput DNA sequencing methods to explore the natural genetic variation in genomes. A unifying aim of these studies is the capture of unbiased genome-wide data sets which are a prerequisite to the development of cell-based connectivity maps of the genome and the epigenomes. We have begun applying these approaches to carryout large-scale analysis of gene expression, virus integration and DNA methylation in the human genome in particular during stem cell development. We strongly believe that the application of "omic" technologies will enable systems biology approaches and provide new insights into processes controlling plant and human development.Since joining the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the year 2000, my laboratory has largely focused on functional genomic studies of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana and of human cells.

VMy research has centered on clinical trials in medical oncology, especially testicular cancer. Our group of clinical researchers has found that by combining cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin the cure rate for metastatic testicular cancer increased from 5 percent to 80 percent. We have studied the two-drug combination of cisplatin and etoposide as second-line chemotherapy and have achieved a 25 percent cure rate. A subsequent phase III study has demonstrated that the substitution of VP-16 for vinblastine ameliorates the neuromuscular toxicity and simultaneously improves cure rates. Since then the three-drug combination of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin has remained standard chemotherapy for metastatic testicular cancer. Subsequent phase III studies have demonstrated that in good-risk patients, identical cure rate was obtained with just three courses (nine weeks) compared to four courses of chemotherapy. We have also addressed novel strategies for patients not curable with their initial chemotherapy, including high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem-cell transplant and the introduction of new agents such as paclitaxel and gemcitabine.My research has centered on clinical trials in medical oncology, especially testicular cancer.

VIn my research I apply lasers to the study of equilibrium and dynamic properties of molecules at liquid and solid interfaces. To probe the very thin region that constitutes an interface we use the interface selective techniques of second harmonic and sum frequency generation. My laboratory has succeeded in developing new methods to develop the absolute orientation of molecules at liquid interfaces to obtain the energetics of adsorption of neutral and charged molecules to the interface to study chemical equilibria and pH at interfaces that we find are markedly different from their bulk values, and to develop a polarity scale for liquid interfaces. Using second harmonic as the probe method has enabled us to observe dynamics at interfaces of excited state cis-trans isomerization, intermolecular energy transfer, solvation dynamics, and rotational molecular motions, which generally differ significantly from their bulk counterparts. We have recently shown that second harmonic spectroscopy can be used to selectively probe the surfaces of centrosymmetric microscopic particles of submicron to micron diameters. Among the surfaces of microscopic particles studied so far are polymer beads in aqueous solution, oil droplet/aqueous emulsions, semiconductor colloids, naturally occurring clay particles, and phospholipid liposomes.In my research I apply lasers to the study of equilibrium and dynamic properties of molecules at liquid and solid interfaces.

VSymplectic geometry serves as a geometric language of classical and quantum mechanics. I was lucky to witness the birth, and participate in the first steps of symplectic topology, a branch of symplectic geometry designed to answer qualitative problems in mechanics, such as the existence of periodic orbits. A tightly related topic of my research is contact geometry and topology, inspired by problems in geometric optics and non-holonomic mechanics.  Problems in symplectic topology led me to the theory of functions of several complex variables, where I was able to find a complete topological characterization of affine complex manifolds. One of the most important techniques, the theory of pseudo-holomorphic curves, was introduced into symplectic topology by M. Gromov. Gromov-Witten theory combines Gromov's theory with a physics inspired algebraic formalism of E. Witten. Together with H. Hofer  and A. Givental, I recently began to develop an enhanced version of the Gromov-Witten theory, called symplectic field theory (SFT). The SFT has already found many applications and we hope that many more are yet to come, particularly in such seemingly unrelated areas as the theory of completely integrable systems and low-dimensional topology.Symplectic geometry serves as a geometric language of classical and quantum mechanics.

Through investigations of how CKIs are regulated, we discovered a modular pathway called the SCF through which proteins are marked for destruction. The SCF has a replaceable adaptor called an F-box protein that works like a socket wrench. When a particular F-box protein is in the SCF it recognizes one set of proteins to destroy, when another is present a different set is recognized. We have also worked to develop genetic cloning technologies to facilitate scientific progress. I believe that new technology drives science and generally has a much larger impact than individual basic science discoveries.I also study how the cell cycle is regulated and discovered a family of Cdk inhibitors, CKIs, which organisms use to control cell proliferation during development and to prevent cancer.

VMy research focuses on human reproductive ecology, or the interaction of the human reproductive system with ecological, behavioral, and constitutional factors.  My group was at the forefront of the development of noninvasive methods for monitoring gonadal steroid profiles in saliva rather than blood or urine, allowing us to follow changes in gonadal function over extended periods of time under natural field conditions.  Using these techniques we have demonstrated the responsiveness of female gonadal function to changes in energy intake and expenditure that follow from specific subsistence ecologies in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America.  We have also demonstrated the impact of these changes in gonadal function on female fecundity and birth seasonality.  We have studies age-related changes in gonadal function in both men and women in a variety of populations, demonstrating the impact of ecology on this aspect of reproductive aging and its relationship to changes in body composition and other aspects of somatic aging.  Recently we have demonstrated linkages between insulin dynamics and ovarian function during the postpartum period in lactating women, proposing a specific mechanism that coordinates the resumption of ovarian cycling with maternal energetic status.  In addition to these studies of the relationship of metabolism and reproductive function we have also conducted many studies of human behavioral endocrinology using salivary steroid measurements.  Among our contributions in this area has been the demonstration of differences in male testosterone levels associated with differences in marital and parental status.  We have also used our techniques and paradigms to contribute to an understanding of the relationship between energetics, and especially exercise, to breast and other steroid-related cancers.My research focuses on human reproductive ecology, or the interaction of the human reproductive system with ecological, behavioral, and constitutional factors.  My group was at the forefront of the development of noninvasive methods for monitoring gonadal steroid profiles in saliva rather than blood or urine, allowing us to follow changes in gonadal function over extended periods of time under natural field conditions.  Using these techniques we have demonstrated the responsiveness of female gonadal function to changes in energy intake and expenditure that follow from specific subsistence ecologies in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America.  We have also demonstrated the impact of these changes in gonadal function on female fecundity and birth seasonality.  We have studies age-related changes in gonadal function in both men and women in a variety of populations, demonstrating the impact of ecology on this aspect of reproductive aging and its relationship to changes in body composition and other aspects of somatic aging.  Recently we have demonstrated linkages between insulin dynamics and ovarian function during the postpartum period in lactating women, proposing a specific mechanism that coordinates the resumption of ovarian cycling with maternal energetic status.  In addition to these studies of the relationship of metabolism and reproductive function we have also conducted many studies of human behavioral endocrinology using salivary steroid measurements.

VMost of my research focuses on the physics and dynamics of the tropical atmosphere and upper ocean. Among the problems that have interested me is the control of atmospheric water vapor by wet convection in the Tropics; this is crucial to understanding climate as water vapor is the strongest feedback in the climate system. The environmental factors that control the vertical air velocity in convective storms are not well understood; these velocities, in turn, determined how much condensed phase water is lofted and thus how effective convection is in moistening the atmosphere. These factors are simply not accounted for in any form in the current generation of global climate models. The physics of tropical cyclones continue to command my attention, especially as they bear on the response of these storms to changing climate. My research also suggests that global tropical cyclone activity is responsible for much of the turbulent mixing of the upper tropical oceans; this in turn is widely though to be the main driver of the ocean's thermohaline circulation. For this reason, tropical cyclones may play a critical role in climate dynamics.Most of my research focuses on the physics and dynamics of the tropical atmosphere and upper ocean.

VAs a cell biologist and biochemist, my research has focused on uncovering the molecular mechanisms responsible for the biogenesis of specialized compartments, called organelles, which are present inside all cells. These organelles perform key biochemical functions that keep cells alive. My laboratory has used a single-cell yeast organism as a model system to discover and isolate the complex machinery as well as a special class of signaling lipids, phosphoinositides, that sort and deliver proteins and enzymes to lysosomes, organelles that degrade and recycle cellular proteins. This sorting machinery directs the packaging of proteins into small membrane-enclosed carriers called vesicles. One set of machines we have discovered, the ESCRT complexes, turn off signals received by specific growth factor receptors at the cell's surface by sorting the activated receptors into vesicles. These vesicles are then delivered to the lysosome where the receptors are inactivated and degraded. Defects in the ESCRT complexes result in prolonged signaling by the growth factor receptors, which ultimately can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumor formation. The ESCRT complexes also have been found to play an essential role in the budding and release of the HIV virus from infected cells.As a cell biologist and biochemist, my research has focused on uncovering the molecular mechanisms responsible for the biogenesis of specialized compartments, called organelles, which are present inside all cells.

Elementary steps of the reaction dynamics are investigated by the use of ultrafast laser techniques. Studies on the mechanisms of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions are performed with clean single crystal surfaces as model systems. Coupling of (nonlinear) reaction kinetics with transport process, such as surface diffusion of adsorbed species or migration of ions in an electrolyte, may give rise to spatio-temporal pattern formation, as studied both experimentally and theoretically. Structuring of electrode surfaces down to the nanometer scale is achieved by application of short voltage pulses.My research concentrates on chemical processes occurring at the interface of solids and gases or liquids (electrolytes).

VI am interested in the regulation of blood clotting, especially the role of the blood vessel proteins in controlling clot formation. Tight regulation of the clotting process is essential to stopping blood loss at wound sites and preventing occlusive blood clots (thrombi) from forming. Biochemical and genetic approaches allowed us to identify two proteins on the endothelial blood vessel lining, thrombomodulin and the endothelial cell protein C receptor, that are critical to controlling blood clotting. Thrombomodulin binds thrombin and prevents it from clotting fibrinogen and activating platelets. It also switches the macromolecular specificity of thrombin so that it activates a plasma zymogen, protein C. Activated protein C then stops further thrombin generation by proteolytically inactivating two key coagulation proteins, factors Va and VIIIa. Activated protein C has additional anti-inflammatory properties. The endothelial cell protein C receptor augments protein C activation and appears to be critical for cellular signaling by activated protein C. I am particularly interested in how this system responds to acute inflammatory challenges, and I am working to identify the receptors involved. I am also creating genetically modified mice to explore the mechanisms by which this system modulates vascular injury in a variety of disease processes, including auto-immunity.I am interested in the regulation of blood clotting, especially the role of the blood vessel proteins in controlling clot formation.

VAs in all organisms, plant development is genetically regulated. However, because plants do not move, their development is also remarkably responsive to the environment. I am interested in the role of plant hormones in both of these aspects of development. Auxin was the first plant hormone to be discovered and has been implicated in virtually every stage of plant growth and development. My laboratory has used the genetically tractable plant Arabidopsis thaliana to identify auxin response pathways. Our work demonstrated that auxin response depends on the rapid degradation of transcriptional repressors called the Aux/IAA proteins. Repressor degradation requires a ubiquitin protein ligase or E3 called SCFTIR1. The function of E3s is to bind protein substrates and promote their ubiquitination and degradation. Recent results indicate that SCFTIR1 acts as an auxin receptor. Auxin binds to the SCF and stabilizes its interaction with the Aux/IAA substrates, thus promoting their degradation. This is both a novel mechanism of hormone perception and E3 regulation. The lab is now turning its attention to the complex transcriptional networks that mediate auxin growth responses. Our ultimate goal is to understand the systems that mediate development at the level of the organism.As in all organisms, plant development is genetically regulated.

I have studied two viruses: rotaviruses, the major cause of diarrhea in children and animals worldwide, and noroviruses that are responsible for almost all outbreaks of nonbacterial gastroenteritis and important causes of disease in humans and animals of all age groups.  I have discovered a new mechanism of pathogenesis for rotaviruses involving a novel enterotoxin that affects cellular calcium homeostasis and regulates viral replication.  In addition, susceptibility to Norwalk virus infection has been found to be related to an individual's genetically determined histoblood group antigens.  Finally, I have used recombinant virus-like particles as probes of virus structure and function and as candidate vaccines for both viruses.As a molecular virologist with an interest in digestive diseases, I use viruses that infect gastrointestinal cells to understand viral and host factors that affect pathogenesis.

VMy research has focused on the mechanisms by which agonists, hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors control cell functions. This involves studies of the cell surface receptors for these agonists, the G proteins, and other proteins that couple to these receptors, and the enzymes that are activated by these proteins and other signals from the receptors. The particular enzymes that are the focus of my work are phospholipases, which hydrolyze membrane phospholipids to produce signaling molecules within the cell. One type is phospholipase C, which controls many cellular functions through regulation of calcium ions and the activation of a phosphorylating enzyme, protein kinase C. Another enzyme I am studying is phospholipase D, which is highly regulated in vivo and in vitro by complex mechanisms involving many cellular factors. Present work is directed towards unraveling the mechanisms of catalysis of this enzyme and its regulation and defining its cellular functions. Some of the factors controlling phospholipase D and the cell cytoskeleton are members of the rho family of small G proteins.

Most of my work has been devoted to understanding the factors regulating photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in contemporary marine organisms, especially phytoplankton and corals. My biophysical approach to photosynthesis led to the development of novel instrumentation which facilitated an understanding of photophysiology in the ocean on spatial scales from millimeters to thousands of kilometers. This work has served as a basis for understanding the global carbon cycle. Over the past decade, I have extended my research back in geological time in an attempt to understand how basic biogeochemical cycles are coupled to abiotic processes, such as tectonics and photochemistry, and how the chemistry of Earth has been influenced over the past 4 billion years.I am a biologist and oceanographer interested in the evolution of biogeochemical cycles.

I showed how six proteins of the complement system distinguished between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell surfaces by their differing carbohydrate composition. I then demonstrated that this ancient system that evolved in invertebrates could mark an antigen so that it could be recognized 10,000-fold more effectively by the "modern" system of an acquired immunity that first appeared with vertebrates. It is hoped this complement system function can be used to develop better vaccines. Most recently, my laboratory has begun to look at immunological memory, which is the ability of the acquired immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively to antigens that it has responded to previously. We are looking at the possibility that memory lymphocytes, which mediate this phenomenon, have a stem cell-like capacity for self-renewal because they are actively suppressed from terminally differentiating to effector lymphocytes.I study the complement system, a part of innate immunity that consists of a group of serum proteins and cellular receptors that mediate anti-microbial defense before the development of an acquired immune response.

VMy main research interests are the biology of angiogenesis and the identification of its regulators. In 1989 we reported the isolation and cDNA cloning of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and proposed that this molecule plays a unique role in the regulation of angiogenesis. My laboratory subsequently focused on the investigation of the molecular and biological properties of VEGF. In 1993 we reported that inhibition of VEGF suppresses tumor growth in vivo. These findings represented the first direct evidence that inhibition of angiogenesis may block tumor growth. These studies also led to the development of a humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) as a cancer therapy. Bevacizumab has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer, in combination with chemotherapy. Also, we investigated the role of VEGF in intraocular neovascular disorders. These studies resulted in the clinical development of a humanized anti-VEGF Fab (ranibizumab), which was recently approved by the FDA for the therapy of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. We are also investigating mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis alternative to VEGF. A recent line of research in our laboratory is the regulation of organ-specific angiogenesis.My main research interests are the biology of angiogenesis and the identification of its regulators.

VHuman impacts on the biosphere have become dominant features of the environment, fundamentally altering processes ranging from community structure to the cycles of carbon, nutrients, water, and energy. These impacts present vast challenges for understanding and management, but they also present unusual opportunities for investigations, using the human influences as probes for the mechanisms that underlie ecosystem processes. My research builds on these opportunities, linking studies from the plant to the global scale. Much of my work has focused on principles for extending ecological and physiological knowledge at the scale of the individual leaf or plant upward to the scale of the ecosystem or the globe. I have used these principles, especially concerning the control of plant growth by light, nutrients, and water, to describe the carbon cycle of the land and oceans, the way they have changed in the past, and the ways they are likely to change in the future. I test these theoretical results against observations, using manipulations to help formulate strategies that are relevant to the real world.Human impacts on the biosphere have become dominant features of the environment, fundamentally altering processes ranging from community structure to the cycles of carbon, nutrients, water, and energy.

VMy interests have centered on developing technologies to analyze the function of proteins. In particular, my laboratory has exploited features of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to establish simple genetic assays. The most widely applied of these assays, the two-hybrid system, uses the modular nature of transcription factors to detect interactions between proteins. A related three-hybrid system, developed in collaboration with Marvin Wickens at the University of Wisconsin, detects RNA-protein interactions. Recently we extended these strategies to design functional screens that encompass an entire genome's worth of proteins. We developed a protein array format in which each predicted protein of an organism is expressed in a form that allows it to be easily assayed. The array format has been used to detect many interactions among S. cerevisiae proteins. It has also been adapted, in collaboration with Eric Phizicky and Elizabeth Grayhack at the University of Rochester, to a biochemical genomics approach. In this approach, proteins expressed with purification tags are purified in pools, the pools are assayed for a biochemical activity, and positive pools are deconvoluted to identify the single protein responsible for an activity. My laboratory has also been using yeast to analyze proteins implicated in human diseases.My interests have centered on developing technologies to analyze the function of proteins.

VDuring the past decade, I have conducted the world's most successful search for relatively nearby supernovae (SNe) using my robotic telescope at Lick Observatory. My research on SNe (a) showed that many core-collapse SNe result from massive stars with partially or highly stripped envelopes, (b) helped establish the Type IIn subclass characterized by ejecta interacting with circumstellar gas, (c) observationally identified the progenitors of some SNe, (d) revealed that many SNe are quite aspherical, and (e) showed that Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) exhibit considerable heterogeneity. This last point was crucial to the development of methods to calibrate SNe Ia for accurate distance determinations. I was a key member of two teams that used high-redshift SNe Ia to discover the accelerating expansion of the Universe, driven by mysterious "dark energy."  My early work showed that the nuclei of most bright, nearby galaxies exhibit activity physically similar to that of quasars, driven by gas accretion onto a supermassive black hole (BH). I contributed to the discovery of the fundamental relationship between central BH mass and galaxy bulge luminosity (and velocity dispersion). In about six X-ray binary stars, I provided compelling dynamical evidence for a stellar-mass BH. Recently, my robotic telescope made some of the earliest measurements of the optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts.During the past decade, I have conducted the world's most successful search for relatively nearby supernovae (SNe) using my robotic telescope at Lick Observatory.

VMy research is centered on obtaining a molecular level understanding of reactions that are known, or have the potential, to occur in the atmosphere.  This detailed understanding of both the kinetics and mechanisms is needed in order to accurately parameterize the chemistry in computer kinetics models on local to regional and global scales.  My research has focused in two areas: (1) reactions of airborne sea salt particles; and (2) reactions of oxides of nitrogen in thin water films on surfaces.  In the first case, we have shown in laboratory studies that the chloride and bromide ions found in sea salt particles can be converted in photochemically active gases via reaction with trace gases found in the atmosphere. These gases serve as sources of highly reactive chlorine and bromine atoms that alter the chemistry of marine areas.  A particularly important finding was that some reactions actually occur at the air-water interface of the sea salt particles, rather than inside the bulk of the particle.  In the second case, we have shown that when NO2 reacts in thin water films on laboratory reactors (which also occurs on the surfaces of buildings, vegetation etc. in the atmosphere), the reaction generates not only gaseous nitrous acid, but also nitric acid on the surface that is largely undissociated and complexed to water at lower relative humidities.  This finding is quite unexpected, and its implications for atmospheric chemistry are currently being explored.My research is centered on obtaining a molecular level understanding of reactions that are known, or have the potential, to occur in the atmosphere.

VOur lab studies the mechanisms by which cells and organisms respond to genetic change. The genetic landscape faced by a living cell is constantly changing. Developmental transitions, environmental shifts, and pathogenic invasions lend a dynamic character to both the genome and its activity pattern. We study a variety of natural mechanisms that are utilized by cells adapting to genetic change. These include mechanisms activated during normal development and systems for detecting and responding to foreign or unwanted genetic activity. At the root of these studies are questions of how a cell can distinguish "self" versus "nonself" and "wanted" versus "unwanted" gene expression. In particular, we are interested in the roles of gene silencing processes in viral pathogenesis and tumor progression in invertebrate and mammalian systems.Our lab studies the mechanisms by which cells and organisms respond to genetic change.

VI have studied the mechanisms that regulate gene imprinting in plants, which causes unequal expression of maternal-derived and paternal-derived alleles and is required for plant reproduction. Plant imprinted genes are expressed in the endosperm, a placenta-like tissue that supports the growth and development of the embryo. The endosperm tissue develops from a fertilized maternal central cell and is the primary source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy for humans and domesticated animals. My laboratory discovered that DNA demethylation in the central cell underlies gene imprinting in Arabidopsis. Maternal alleles in the central cell are demethylated by the base excision DNA repair pathway. A DNA glycosylase, DME, initiates DNA demethylation by excising 5-methylcytosine, which is replaced with cytosine by DNA polymerase. Because DNA demethylation occurs before fertilization the central cell and not in sperm, imprinted alleles are epigenetically marked depending on their parent-of-origin; maternal alleles are demethylated and transcriptionally active, whereas paternal alleles are methylated and silenced. DNA demethylation in the central cell activates expression of maternal Polycomb group proteins that, in turn, imprint and silence additional genes by histone methylation. Thus, multiple epigenetic mechanisms in the central cell program gene imprinting in the endosperm. More recently, I have been studying the epigenetic regulation of imprinting at the genome-wide level and find that DNA demethylation extensively reconfigures the endosperm methylation landscape.I have studied the mechanisms that regulate gene imprinting in plants, which causes unequal expression of maternal-derived and paternal-derived alleles and is required for plant reproduction.

VI am a theoretician who studies a broad-range of plasma and energetic particle phenomena in the atmosphere of the Sun and the heliosphere, the region of space carved out by the expansion of the solar atmosphere, the solar wind. In this field there have been a number of exciting observations for which new theories needed to be developed. In 1974, I proposed that the newly discovered anomalous cosmic rays, highly overabundant in helium, oxygen, nitrogen and neon, are interstellar atoms that are ionized in the solar wind, and then accelerated by four orders of magnitude in the outer heliosphere. This theory, confirmed by subsequent observations, has influenced our current understanding that the heliosphere is a dynamic and interesting astrophysical location. In 1978, I introduced a plasma-heating model that accounted for the newly observed Helium-3 rich solar flares, in which this isotope is greatly enhanced. In 1996, I developed a new model for the configuration of the magnetic field in the heliopshere to explain the unexpected transport of energetic particles in solar latitude. This model, in which the solar magnetic field undergoes systematic motions, has led to my recent research on the evolution of the solar magnetic field during the solar cycle, the acceleration of the solar wind, and the acceleration of energetic particles in the solar wind.I am a theoretician who studies a broad-range of plasma and energetic particle phenomena in the atmosphere of the Sun and the heliosphere, the region of space carved out by the expansion of the solar atmosphere, the solar wind.

VMy research is centered on the function of eukaryotic genes and the consequences of their mutation on human and animal biology. My initial work established the discontinuous structure of the beta-globin gene and defined mutated forms of these genes in human patients with thalassemia. My laboratory pursued early studies using transfection into animal cells to determine the consequences of structural and regulatory mutations in globin genes. Our cosmid libraries made it possible to study more complex gene families, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We elucidated the molecular organization of the multigene family and determined the molecular basis of MHC polymorphism, which is intergenic transfer of genetic information. We turned then to ways the immune function could be studied in genetically modified animals. Applying transgenesis and gene targeting, we made insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response. Our studies have focused on cell fate decisions made between different T lymphocyte populations and have identified transcription factors responsible for these decisions. We have elucidated the function of caspases in the apoptotic process, which has led to the identification of several pathways of cell death in the immune and central nervous systems. Using genetically manipulated animal models, my laboratory has addressed the underlying mechanisms of autoimmune diseases. We have found that inflammatory responses impact strongly on the development of autoimmune disease and that regulatory mechanisms prevent autoimmunity under normal circumstances.My research is centered on the function of eukaryotic genes and the consequences of their mutation on human and animal biology.

VMy research focuses on developing an understanding of condensed phase dynamics with applications to chemistry, biophysics and condensed matter physics. To this end, my laboratory combines ultrafast spectroscopy, analytical theory and simulation. The primary steps of photosynthesis - light harvesting, and electron transfer - are topics of particular interest. We have discovered many of the design principles used to optimize and regulate photosynthetic light harvesting, including most recently the role of quantum coherence in enhancing efficiency. We have also characterized the timescales and molecular mechanism by which water and other highly polar liquids accommodate to changes in electronic structure of solute, and shown that chemically reactive motion in solution is often free, ballistic motion (rather than diffusive) over chemically significant length scales and for chemically significant timescales. New nanoscale materials may have electronic structures that are described neither by infinite semiconductor approaches or molecular approaches. Single-walled carbon nanotubes are one such example and my laboratory showed that an excitonic description is required, determined the exciton binding energy, and has recently shown that electronic coherence is extraordinarily long-lived - even at room temperature - in these systems. Our work often depends on the development of new non-linear optical techniques and examples include fluorescence interferometry, new classes of photon echo spectroscopy and two-dimensional electronic and Raman spectroscopy.My research focuses on developing an understanding of condensed phase dynamics with applications to chemistry, biophysics and condensed matter physics.

VEarly in my scientific career I became interested in the kinetic processes that lead to the change in identity of molecular quantum states, processes that almost always involve the transfer of energy between molecules. Using infrared laser techniques, my laboratory has studied three of the four important vibrational energy transfer processes in chemistry: (1) the mechanism by which energy, initially localized in one vibrational mode of a molecule, is transferred to another mode in the same molecule by a collision; (2) the process by which a molecular collision converts translational energy into vibrational energy; and (3) the removal of vibrational excitation from molecules that contain sufficient energy to rupture a chemical bond. This work has focused both on the mechanism by which these processes take place and on the quantitative rates for these events. Lately my laboratory has begun to use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate self-assembled molecular films physisorbed at the interface between a liquid and a solid. Special emphasis has been placed on the two-dimensional self-assembly of films with chiral properties. This scanning probe work has now been expanded to include the study of surface and interfacial chemical processes of importance in environmental, materials, and nano science.Early in my scientific career I became interested in the kinetic processes that lead to the change in identity of molecular quantum states, processes that almost always involve the transfer of energy between molecules.

VIn my career in information theory and digital communications, my research has been intimately intertwined with my practical industrial interests.  My earliest work was on convolutional coding, particularly for digital space communications, which led directly to a number of fundamental papers on the theory of such codes.  Subsequently, at Codex Corporation, which became a subsidiary of Motorola, we designed a number of generations of commercially successful high-speed telephone-line modems, which both influenced and were influenced by advances in the theory of bandwidth-efficient digital communications.  Most recently, I have been trying to understand the latest capacity-approaching codes as codes on graphs, with connections to earlier interests in system theory, as well as to statistical physics.  There are few engineering fields in which theory and practice are so closely related.In my career in information theory and digital communications, my research has been intimately intertwined with my practical industrial interests.

VAs a marine geophysicist and earthquake seismologist, I am interested in the physical properties of the Earth's tectonic plates, the nature of convection in the upper mantle, and the processes that form new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges.  Using arrays of seismometers on the seafloor and on land, I study the seismic velocity structure and anisotropy of the lithosphere and asthenosphere as a means of revealing variations in temperature, composition and the flow pattern associated with convection and the aging of the plates.  In the oceans, I have concentrated particularly on mapping out variations in crustal thickness and the structure of the underlying mantle to try to understand the pattern of melt generation and migration that supplies the magma that forms new crust.  Current projects include a study of a transform fault system on the East Pacific Rise spreading center and a seismic tomography study of California and the adjacent Basin and Range province.As a marine geophysicist and earthquake seismologist, I am interested in the physical properties of the Earth's tectonic plates, the nature of convection in the upper mantle, and the processes that form new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges.

VOur lab is interested in the interplay between nutritional status, immune defense and the neuroendocrine system. Single element deficiencies in zinc or multi-component deficiencies in protein-calories cause a rapid decline in antibody and cell mediated responses. We have shown that such deficiencies activate the neuroendocrine stress axis causing chronic production of glucocorticoids which rapidly reduce lymphopoiesis by accelerating apoptosis among pre T and pre B cells. The resulting decline in the numbers of peripheral lymphocytes impairs host defense. These changes impact malnourished children as well as those with chronic diseases where suboptimal nutriture compromises immune defense. We recently discovered a compensatory mechanism whereby the elevated glucocorticoids promote myelopoiesis. Thus, the phagocytic cells that are the first line of defense remain plentiful with retention of key functions thereby providing interim protection. Currently we are examining the dysregulation of the immune system created by obesity using the morbidly obese undergoing gastric bypass surgery and the overfed mouse as models for study. Our goal is to better understand the neuroendocrine-metabolic changes in obesity that lead to higher rates of infection, increased pneumonia, and poor wound healing.Our lab is interested in the interplay between nutritional status, immune defense and the neuroendocrine system.

VOriginally trained as a physicist, I developed an interest in methods to investigate biological structures with the transmission electron microscope. Using the novel technique of cryo-EM single-particle reconstruction which my group pioneered, I'm studying the mechanism of protein synthesis in bacteria and eukaryotes in collaborations with leading groups in ribosome biochemistry. In appropriate buffer, ribosomes complexed in vitro with mRNA, tRNAs and protein factors are functionally active, and can be stalled in defined states by the use of antibiotics or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs. Electron micrographs of such complexes embedded in vitreous ice, taken with low dose, are processed to obtain three-dimensional density maps at a resolution ranging between 8 and 12 angstroms. In this way, the binding positions of initiation, elongation, and release factors on the ribosome have been revealed. Fitting of X-ray structures into these maps shows evidence of conformational changes during translation, indicating that the interaction between the ribosome and its ligands is highly dynamic. Important processes that cryo-EM has helped to elucidate include the way viral RNA (IRES) enters the ribosome, and the mechanism of protein export.Originally trained as a physicist, I developed an interest in methods to investigate biological structures with the transmission electron microscope.

VOur goal is to understand the organization, function and expression of the molecules present in the surface coat of Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan agent of Chagas disease. The surface of this parasite is composed of members of two large families; mucins that are involved in protection and cell invasion, and trans-sialidases that incorporate sialic acid from host glycoconjugates to the parasite mucins. The core proteins of mucins are highly diverse in stages of the parasite in mammals but very similar to each other in the insect parasite stages, suggesting their functioning in immune evasion. Characterization of the primary and 3-dimensional structures of the trans-sialidase allowed demonstration of the function of its different domains and its mechanism of action. Lactose derivatives were shown to be inhibitors of its biological activity preventing parasite infection and the pathology caused by trans-sialidase in cells of the immune system. Coordinate expression of mucins and trans-sialidases in different parasite stages is achieved essentially through posttranscriptional mechanisms involving ribonucleoprotein complexes formation in the 3'untranslated region of the transcripts. More recently our group was involved in the modulation of mRNA expression in the hippocampus of mammals subjected to chronic stress. Studies on M6a, a surface neuronal glycoprotein, suggest the involvement of synaptic plasticity in the response to chronic stress.Our goal is to understand the organization, function and expression of the molecules present in the surface coat of Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan agent of Chagas disease.

VAs an epidemiologist I am involved in population- and family-based studies to identify the environmental and genetic determinants of cancer. Through computer-generated mapping of U.S. cancer mortality rates at the county level, my group uncovered and then investigated high-risk populations for particular tumors, which provided new insights into lifestyle and other environmental risk factors such as smokeless tobacco in oral cancer and asbestos and arsenical exposures in lung cancer. I have defined and investigated genetic susceptibility states for familial constellations of cancer, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome (with Frederick P. Li), and malformation-cancer syndromes, such as aniridia-Wilms's tumor (with Robert W. Miller). More recently, I have developed strategies that combine epidemiologic and molecular approaches to dissect the role of common susceptibility genes and environmental exposures, along with their interactive effects in the origins and progression of cancer. We hope to enlarge our understanding of cancer causation and inform new clinical and public health approaches aimed at cancer prevention by incorporating the emerging technologies of human genomics into robust population- and family-based designs.As an epidemiologist I am involved in population- and family-based studies to identify the environmental and genetic determinants of cancer.

VI perform research at the interface of chemistry, materials science, and biology and am concerned with the design, preparation, and study of synthetic macromolecules and nanometer scale molecular assemblies with controlled size, shape, and functionality. These include dendrimers and related polymers that perform functions or operate as devices, either as single molecules or as cooperative assemblies. For example, my coworkers and I prepare globular macromolecules, approximately the size of a small protein that function as antennae performing the light harvesting and energy transfer functions that constitute the early steps of photosynthesis. Other molecules, designed to act as nanoscale reactors powered by free energy, are capable of driving mass transfer in and out of their inner cavity where transition state catalysis takes place. Functional polymers are also invaluable to perform molecular recognition and separation function. To illustrate, we have developed new monolithic polymer media that offer unmatched versatility in the performance of tasks as varied as mixers, valves, or pumps for microfluidics, supports for chiral separations, or media for the very fast analysis of large proteomes. In the field of polymer therapeutics, dendritic molecules show great promise as efficient carriers for targeted drug delivery and gene therapy.I perform research at the interface of chemistry, materials science, and biology and am concerned with the design, preparation, and study of synthetic macromolecules and nanometer scale molecular assemblies with controlled size, shape, and functionality.

VMy research is primarily focused on observational cosmology. I have been very active in measuring the current expansion rate of the universe, or the Hubble constant, making use of large optical telescopes, both on the ground, as well as the Hubble Space Telescope. I was a co-principal investigator of the Hubble key project to measure the Hubble constant. This project centered on the discovery and use of Cepheid variable stars and their application to the extragalactic distance scale. Recently, my interests have turned toward using supernovae as probes of the past expansion rate of the universe. We have begun a new, long-term Carnegie supernova project with the goal of elucidating the nature of dark energy in the universe. I have also had a long-standing interest in the evolution of galaxies, particularly the study of the nearby universe and the stellar populations of galaxies.My research is primarily focused on observational cosmology.

VMy laboratory studies the mechanisms by which genes contribute to differences in food intake and body weight. In the absence of the hormone leptin, humans and other mammals become massively obese. Such individuals also manifest a dramatic increase in food intake and develop many other abnormalities that are corrected by injections of leptin. We are investigating the mechanisms by which leptin reduces weight in this and other settings. We are also exploring the ways that changes of the blood levels of this single molecule can alter a complex behavior, namely how much an individual eats. Other efforts are aimed at establishing the genetic basis of obesity amongst the residents of Kosrae, a Pacific island with a high prevalence of this condition.My laboratory studies the mechanisms by which genes contribute to differences in food intake and body weight.

VMy research focuses on the cell and developmental regulatory mechanisms that drive differentiation. How does the developmental program modify not only gene expression, but also fundamental aspects of cell behavior such as cytoskeletal assembly and cell cycle progression, to build tissues, organs and embryos? My recent research has focused on how adult stem cells both self-renew and produce specialized differentiated progeny. By studying a model adult stem cell lineage in vivo, the Drosophila male germ line, we learned how the microenvironment of the niche instructs cells to maintain stem cell identity and how stem cells orient toward their attachment to the niche to program asymmetric cell division. We are currently trying to decipher how the proliferation of transit amplifying cells is controlled and how cells in stem cell lineages are programmed to stop dividing and turn on terminal differentiation. We are also studying a key downstream target of the switch from proliferation to differentiation, the gene regulatory mechanisms that turn on cell type specific transcription programs for terminal differentiation.My research focuses on the cell and developmental regulatory mechanisms that drive differentiation.

VTo study the carbon cycle I put together a simple global model of seasonal carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and land biosphere and used it in an atmospheric tracer/circulation model to quantify the contribution of different ecosystems to the seasonal cycle of carbon dioxide at the remote marine-observing sites. In synthesizing the distributions of fossil-fuel carbon dioxide emission with the available atmospheric and oceanic carbon observations, it was found that a principal ocean sink was incompatible with the north-south gradient of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Matching both the global carbon budget and the hemispheric carbon dioxide gradient demanded a land sink in middle latitudes in the northern hemisphere. I have also studied the cycles of other trace species: methane from saturated soils, dust from dry soils, and more recently iron in the upper ocean. The fine dust is both radiatively important and a source of iron to support marine productivity in the remote ocean. More recently I have progressed toward a comprehensive climate-biogeochemistry model by coupling interactive land and carbon cycles into the National Center for Atmospheric Research community climate system model. The goal is to investigate the co-evolution of climate and to trace past and future gases.To study the carbon cycle I put together a simple global model of seasonal carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and land biosphere and used it in an atmospheric tracer/circulation model to quantify the contribution of different ecosystems to the seasonal cycle of carbon dioxide at the remote marine-observing sites.

VMy research has explored two of the evolutionary processes that have generated the extraordinary diversity of organisms: speciation and ecological divergence. My group has undertaken ecological, population genetic, and phylogenetic analyses of herbivorous insects and their host plants, which together account for nearly half the described species of organisms. Herbivorous insects exemplify ecological specialization and diversification, and coevolutionary responses of plants and insects to each other are postulated to have fostered diversification. My group was among the first to describe host-associated genetic variation in insect populations, and to use genetic variation to test for physiological tradeoffs that might account for ecological (i.e., host-plant) specialization. We have challenged claims for the prevalence of sympatric speciation by host-plant shifts, and were among the first to use coalescent analysis to test the hypothesis of founder-effect speciation in insects. I helped to clarify the meanings of "coevolution," and showed that despite frequent phylogenetic "conservatism" of insects' host associations, simultaneous divergence of plants and insects is unusual. We advanced the hypothesis that genetic changes in host preference may precede physiological adaptations, and have provided evidence that limitations on genetic variation may bias or constrain the avenues of adaptation, and thus influence phylogenetic patterns of ecological associations between plants and insects.My research has explored two of the evolutionary processes that have generated the extraordinary diversity of organisms: speciation and ecological divergence.

VThe central thrust of my physics research is to test the most fundamental symmetries of nature using low energy methods. A single electron, suspended in our apparatus for months at a time and cooled to 100 mK, is used to measure the electron magnetic moment to 3 parts in 10^{13} -- an accuracy 15 times higher than realized in earlier experiments. This measurement and QED theory determines the fine structure constant to 4 parts in 10^{10} -- about 20 times more accurately than any rival method. A single suspended antiproton was used to show that the proton and its antimatter counterpart have the same charge-to-mass ratio (but with opposite sign) to about 1 part in 10^{10}. Our antimatter studies developed the methods to produce and study antihydrogen atoms. We hope to eventually compare to hydrogen atoms using extremely precise laser spectroscopy.The central thrust of my physics research is to test the most fundamental symmetries of nature using low energy methods.

VI am fascinated by the phenomena of cooperation and altruism in animals and by the ability of animals to maintain a fine balance between cooperation and conflict. To facilitate a combination of theoretical and empirical investigations of these phenomena I have chosen the primitively eusocial tropical wasp Ropalidia marginata that occurs abundantly in southern India. Among the many advantages of this species as a model system, perhaps the most important is that these wasps can live either a solitary life or can organize themselves into societies of reasonable complexity. Hence they make it possible to meaningfully compare and contrast the costs and benefits of social and solitary life. Over 25 years of my research, much of it pursued in collaboration with a number of very gifted students and collaborators, has uncovered many novel features of the social organisation of these wasps such as behavioural caste differentiation and pre-imaginal caste bias. I have also developed and empirically tested a hierarchy of demographic, inclusive fitness models, that provide a powerful mechanism for the evolution of social life. Perhaps our most significant contribution has been to demonstrate the inadequacy of focussing on genetic relatedness alone and to emphasize the need to also study ecology, physiology and demography for a fuller understanding of the evolution of insect societies.I am fascinated by the phenomena of cooperation and altruism in animals and by the ability of animals to maintain a fine balance between cooperation and conflict.

VRecently I have focused the majority of my efforts at the interface of the fields of neurobiology and stem cell biology. These studies began with our discovery that FGF-2 could be used to isolate and propagate neural stem cells from the adult hippocampus. We went on to demonstrate that the isolated adult stem cells could be transplanted back to the adult brain, where they could differentiate into mature neurons in specific brain regions. These regions were found to be the same regions in which the adult brain harbors endogenous cells that give rise to neurons throughout life. My colleagues and I then demonstrated that the stem cells persist in the dentate gyrus, giving rise to new neurons throughout life, and that the rate at which new neurons are born and subsequently survive and integrate into the brain is regulated by environment and experience (for example, enrichment and exercise). Subsequently, we showed that this process of neurogenesis occurs in humans. We have been actively identifying mechanisms that regulate and control neurogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo, and most importantly, have characterized several critical elements in the cellular and molecular niche of the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus that controls neurogenesis. This line of investigation was highlighted by the observation that adult hippocampal astrocytes induce adult hippocampus stem cells to become neurons. In a separate set of experiments combining retroviral gene targeting, confocal microscopy and single unit patch recording, we demonstrate that the neurons born in the adult brain are functional. We continue to work on the molecular mechanisms and environmental stimuli that control and regulate adult neurogenesis, as well as begin to address functional role for neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain.Recently I have focused the majority of my efforts at the interface of the fields of neurobiology and stem cell biology.

VMy research pursues a psychophysical approach to screening for memory malfunction in genetically manipulated mice. The purpose is to make possible a genetic attack on the problem of the physical (cellular and molecular) basis of memory by developing behavioral screening methods that distinguish between genetic defects in memory per se and genetic defects in the many processes that affect the extent and how memory is manifest in behavior. Memory is the mechanism(s) that carry information forward in time within nervous systems. My behavioral screens look for distortions and increased noise in simple quantitative memories like interval duration, distance, and number. It is psychophysical in character in that it tests memory for the same simple quantity repeatedly (hundreds of times) and processes the results with the kind of elaborate statistical analysis employed in psychophysical work on sensory systems. As in sensory psychophysics, the goal is to extract from behavioral data quantitative properties of the underlying mechanisms. The experimental research grows out of my theoretical research on problem-specific (modular) information-processing approaches to learning and memory.My research pursues a psychophysical approach to screening for memory malfunction in genetically manipulated mice.

VMy scholarly interest, as that of a linguist and culture historian, is concentrated mainly on the study of theoretical problems pertaining to Typological and Comparative Historical Linguistics, with a special emphasis on Caucasian, Indo-European, Semitic & Ancient Oriental Languages. New methodological principles of combining comparative language reconstruction with linguistic typology and language universals allowed us to propose a new model of the South Caucasian (Kartvelian) Proto-Language, which appears to be isomorphic to the Proto-Indo-European (as far as the reconstructed system of sonants and the apophony is concerned). The same method of linguistic reconstruction, taking into account the evidence of language typology and linguistic universals as a verification criterion for proposed reconstructed models of a Proto-Language, brought us to postulating a typologically plausible linguistic model of Proto-Indo-European, which appears to be totally different from that adopted in traditional Indo-European Comparative Historical Linguistics. This concerns, in the first place, the consonantal system of Proto-Indo-European. The traditional and classical threefold system of Proto-Indo-European stops has been given a phonetic reinterpretation, in which the traditional plain voiced stops are viewed as "glottalized". Such reinterpretation of the system has been styled in Indo-European Linguistics "Glottalic Theory" and compared as to its consequences for the whole of Indo-European to the "Laryngeal Theory" and considered as a new "paradigm" in Indo-European comparative historical linguistics.My scholarly interest, as that of a linguist and culture historian, is concentrated mainly on the study of theoretical problems pertaining to Typological and Comparative Historical Linguistics, with a special emphasis on Caucasian, Indo-European, Semitic & Ancient Oriental Languages.

VMy research has applied genetic and molecular strategies in Drosophila (fruitflies) to study two different areas of broad biological interest. We investigated a complex, naturally occuring genetic system in which an unususal mutant chromosome is transmitted at the expense of its normal partner to 100% of the offspring, in complete violation of Mendelian principles. The selfish behavior of this chromosome bears importantly on questions ranging from control of chromosome behavior to evolutionary mechanisms in natural populations. We identified the genes responsible for this phenomenon and discovered that the underlying defect involves a disruption of nuclear transport. My second area of investigation is neurogenetics where we have studied electrical signaling in the nervous system at the molecular level by isolating and characterizing mutations that specifically perturb nerve cell function and development. These studies have led to the identification of many key proteins, such as ion channels and components of the synaptic release machinery, involved in generation and transmission of nerve impulses. More recently, we have investigated molecular mechanisms that mediate synaptic growth and plasticity and that maintain normal neuronal viability. Discovery of the Drosophila genes enabled identification of the human counterparts, a number of which have now been linked to neurological and related disorders.My research has applied genetic and molecular strategies in Drosophila (fruitflies) to study two different areas of broad biological interest.

VI am a physical oceanographer with a background in applied mathematics and fluid dynamics. My research emphasis has mostly been on theoretical studies of small-scale processes such as waves, tides, turbulent dispersion and mixing, air-sea interaction, and the dynamics of flows in straits. Some highlights have been (i) discovery of the conservation of wave action, or energy divided by intrinsic frequency, rather than energy, (ii) explaining the world's highest tides in the Bay of Fundy in terms of resonance at 13.3 hours of the Fundy/Maine system, (iii) providing simple models for the ubiquitous internal waves in the ocean, (iv) unraveling some of the hydraulics of the exchange flow through the Strait of Gibraltar, (v) using the Mediterranean and Red Sea as test basins for learning about air-sea fluxes, (vi) finding simple ways of understanding the complicated fluid dynamics of turbulent, rotating, stratified motions near the sloping sides of ocean basins. I have also contributed to assessments of the oceanic disposal of radioactive and other wastes, and to issues of ocean energy, such as iceberg trajectory prediction for the Canadian offshore oil industry and deriving fundamental limits to tidal power as well as evaluating its environmental impact.I am a physical oceanographer with a background in applied mathematics and fluid dynamics.

VI study perception and perceptual neuroscience, with an emphasis on vision in humans and non-human primates. My early years were directed at understanding the relationship between the retinal physiology of light and dark adaptation and the behavioral detection and discrimination performance of humans. This was followed by a series of studies directed at understanding the role of optical and retinal factors in limiting human spatial and color vision. These studies pioneered the application of (Bayesian) ideal observer theory to domains beyond simple photon detection and intensity discrimination. More recently the lab has been focused on spatial and contrast coding in the primate visual cortex, on natural tasks and natural scene statistics, and on the mathematics of how to perform perceptual tasks optimally. For example, we derived the theory for how to move the eyes optimally when searching for targets in natural texture and are using that theory to analyze human performance and eye movement statistics. For another example, we measured the statistical properties of contours in natural scenes, derived the theory of how to optimally use those properties to detect and interpolate contours in natural images and are using the theory to analyze human contour detection and interpolation performance.I study perception and perceptual neuroscience, with an emphasis on vision in humans and non-human primates.

VMy research interests are in experimental astrophysics. Our research group has been studying the physical processes and the evolution of active galaxies, particularly their central regions. One key issue is whether these galaxies are powered either by accretion onto massive black holes or by star formation and how these processes might be related. In the nucleus of the Milky Way galaxy we were able to show from near-infrared imaging observations of the motions of individual stars in the central few light days that there must be a million-solar-mass, central black hole. A key goal of our future research program is to study with high-resolution techniques the properties and evolution of star and black hole formation in the early Universe. To pursue our key research goals our group has been developing novel instrumentation, mainly in the infrared and submillimeter range, for large ground-based, airborne, and space telescopes.My research interests are in experimental astrophysics.

VWorking in the field of Astronomy, I have focused on the development and application of high spatial resolution infrared imaging techniques to the questions of the origin and early life of stars and planets, and the distribution and nature of matter at the center of our galaxy. From my group's measurements of stars orbiting the center of our Galaxy, we have demonstrated the existence of a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, with a mass of four million times that of our Sun. Our current experiments in this area are aimed at understanding how the black hole gains mass from its surroundings and what we can learn by analogy about the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central black holes. In our work on young stars, we have discovered that most, if not all, star shortly after birth have companion stars and that in most cases the binary star separations that are smaller than the size of our solar system. Our work suggests that planetary systems such as our own are not the norm and raises many questions. For example, how do stars end up as multiples when they are young? What influence do the companion stars have on the formation of planets?Working in the field of Astronomy, I have focused on the development and application of high spatial resolution infrared imaging techniques to the questions of the origin and early life of stars and planets, and the distribution and nature of matter at the center of our galaxy.

VI am a philosopher with a specialty in ethical theory. I have worked most intensively in metaethics, the study of the meaning of ethical statements and the nature of ethical judgments. During the early part of my career, I also worked in the theory of social choice, most prominently, on the impossibility of designing a non-trivial system of voting that is proof against strategic manipulation. Equivalently, no social mechanism can be designed to guarantee that no matter what people's preferences are, everyone will have a dominant strategy. The mathematical theory of social choice bears on economics, politics, and ethical theory, and I have been interested in how the findings of the theory might have normative upshots. My central research in recent decades has been on the nature of normative claims. These include claims of right and wrong, and of rationality in action and belief. Among other things, my question has been what is at issue in debates in decision theory, game theory, and statistics over what beliefs and acts are rational. My current work explores the possibility that the concept of meaning and the concept of what a person is thinking are themselves normative concepts, tied conceptually to how it is rational to think.I am a philosopher with a specialty in ethical theory.

VI study the cortical mechanisms of visual perception, including the role of visual cortex in analyzing visual images and in perceptual learning. My lab has found that primary visual cortex performs a high-level analysis of the visual scene, mediating contour integration and surface segmentation. We have shown how the functional properties of visual cortex are subject to learning, and how, with training, the cortex encodes information about complex stimulus configurations. To study the mechanisms of cortical information processing, we have focused on cortical circuitry. This led to our discovery of long range horizontal connections in cortex, and their role in integrating the visual image, as well as in cortical plasticity. We study the influence of experience in remodeling cortical circuits, including perceptual learning and functional recovery following central nervous system damage. We are also investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in this remodeling. Another emphasis of our work is the role of higher order influences in early sensory processing. We have shown that the cortex continually changes its functional role according to the influence of attention, expectation and perceptual task. This suggests that the properties of any cortical area, even in adults, are dynamic, being subject to experience and to top-down influences.I study the cortical mechanisms of visual perception, including the role of visual cortex in analyzing visual images and in perceptual learning.

VI am interested in understanding the components of the blood-clotting system and how disturbances in their function lead to human bleeding and blood-clotting disorders. I have studied the molecular basis of von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder, and identified modifier genes that control the severity of VWD. In our lab we also have defined mutations in ADAMTS13, an enzyme that processes von Willebrand factor, as the cause of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Purpura. We are also searching for genetic modifiers of thrombotic diseases, including the common human mutation Factor V Leiden.  Studies of the bleeding disease combined deficiency of factors V and VIII by the conducted in our lab identified mutations in two genes that define a novel pathway for the transport of a select subset of proteins from the ER to the Golgi.  Finally, we study the plasminogen activation (PA) system, the central mechanism by which blood clots are broken down (fibrinolysis). Genetically engineered mice are being used to explore the role of the PA system in a variety of disease processes including pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis and bacterial infection.I am interested in understanding the components of the blood-clotting system and how disturbances in their function lead to human bleeding and blood-clotting disorders.

VI am a theoretical condensed matter physicist with broad interests in quantum many-body problems, low-dimensional and mesoscopic systems and quantum computation. I am currently interested in nanomechanical systems, cold atomic gases, quantum optics and quantum computation. Most recently I have been working closely with Yale experimentalists Rob Schoelkopf and Michel Devoret developing 'circuit QED' a new paradigm of quantum optics and cavity QED for superconducting electrical circuits. Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is the study of photons trapped in a resonant cavity and interacting with atoms. In 'circuit QED' the resonant optical cavity is replaced by an ultra-small on-chip electrical circuit which acts as a microwave resonator and the atom is replaced by a Cooper pair box qubit (quantum bit). The Cooper pair box consists of two micron-scale superconducting islands connected by a Josephson tunnel junction. Each superconducting island holds tens to hundreds of billions of pairs of electrons and yet quantum excitations in which only a single additional pair of electrons tunnel through the junction from one island to the other can be readily detected. In addition to being a fundamental probe of QED in a new ultra-strong-coupling regime, this architecture holds promise for quantum computation.I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist with broad interests in quantum many-body problems, low-dimensional and mesoscopic systems and quantum computation.

VMy laboratory explores the structure and function of large photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes called phycobilisomes. A general feature of such complexes is the presence of numerous "antenna pigments" that absorb light and transfer the excitation energy from pigment to pigment by radiationless energy transfer processes with an overall efficiency greater than 95 percent to a special chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll in the reaction center for subsequent conversion to electron flow. Phycobilisomes are the principal light harvesters in cyanobacteria and red algae. These intricate complexes, of 6 to 8 million daltons, are made up entirely of proteins, with 500 to 700 covalently attached linear tetrapyrroles (bilins) that absorb visible light over a wide spectral range. Phycobilisomes are the largest light-harvesting complexes known that can be isolated in intact form. Our work showed that the differences in the absorbance properties of the individual bilins and the details of their spatial arrangement in the phycobilisome lead to a highly directional pathway for energy transfer toward the reaction center irrespective of where in the phycobilisome the photon is absorbed. With respect to the rate-determining steps in energy transfer, phycobilisomes function as if they were arrays of no more than a half-dozen pigment molecules.My laboratory explores the structure and function of large photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes called phycobilisomes.

VMy research interests lie at the intersection of human environmental impact, economic development, and international security and policy, with a focus on freshwater resources. Water is key to a wide range of scientific, ecological, social, and political issues. Of particular interest to me are: the impacts of climate changes on water resources, and associated issues related to adaptation and water management; the connections between freshwater and violent conflicts at local and international levels; and the serious challenges associated with the failure to meet basic human needs for water and water services for vast numbers of people. Linking all of these issues together, I'm interested in the concept of the "soft path" for water -- an approach to water management, planning, and use that acknowledges the entire range of technological, environmental, social, economic, and political factors associated the freshwater problem. Other research interests include improving our understanding of water use, the links between water and food, the health issues associated with freshwater use, and the broad issue of the integrity of science. On this last issue, new threats to the scientific process and the ways in which science is used in policymaking require new thinking and new analysis.My research interests lie at the intersection of human environmental impact, economic development, and international security and policy, with a focus on freshwater resources.

VI am a linguist and psycholinguist. One of my main interests concerns the architecture and semantic content of the mental lexicon, i.e., the psychological representation of the forms and meanings of words. My second major interest is in how children acquire both the lexicon and the syntactic structure of the native tongue. As one indication of the astonishing nature of this learning feat by infants, it is striking that from about the age of 18 months to the fifth birthday, children acquire about 15,000 words. That means about one new word per waking hour every day, a rate that hardly lessens in the succeeding decade of life. I have been particularly interested in studying populations that are deprived by tragedies of nature from exposure to normal language input (e.g., blind and isolated deaf children who acquire language normally despite the distortions in the referential and structural information they receive). The robustness of this learning to input variation suggests significant biological preparedness for language in the human infant.I am a linguist and psycholinguist.

VAs an immunologist, I have used biochemical and genetic approaches to elucidate the molecular pathways that regulate CD4 T helper cell development and activation. The complex regulatory pathways governing Thelper1/Thelper2 (TH1/TH2) responses are critical for both the development of protective immunity and for the pathophysiologic immune responses underlying autoimmune, allergic, infectious, and neoplastic disease. This developmental event is regulated by the IL-4 and IFN-gamma cytokines. During the last ten years, I have studied the transcriptional pathways that control this important immune checkpoint to define the genetic bases of both IL-4 and IFN-gamma expression in T cells. My group identified the proto-oncogene c-maf as the transcription factor responsible for TH2-specific IL-4 expression and, subsequently, isolated a second novel protein, NIP45, that together with c-maf and the NFAT family of transcription factors controls IL-4 gene expression and TH2 differentiation. Subsequently, my group discovered the first TH1-specific transcription factor, T-bet, and demonstrated that this single factor is a master-regulator of both IFN-gamma gene expression and the TH1 phenotype. Most recently I have expanded my interest in lineage commitment in lymphocytes to the B cell with the discovery of the transcription factor XBP-1 that controls plasma cell differentiation.As an immunologist, I have used biochemical and genetic approaches to elucidate the molecular pathways that regulate CD4 T helper cell development and activation.

VDr. Goff and his colleagues are analyzing the replication of the mammalian retroviruses, including the murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), to define the functions of each of the viral gene products and to identify host proteins with which the viruses interact. Dr. Goff's laboratory has used in vitro mutagenesis to identify portions of the viral proteins required for each step in the virus life cycle. These mutational studies have addressed the functions of the virion structural proteins (encoded by the Gag gene), as well as reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). A major area of study in the laboratory is the use of somatic cell genetics and the two-hybrid system to identify host proteins involved in virus replication. Current efforts are focussing on the characterization of several novel host proteins that interact with the Gag, Pol, and Env gene products of the virus. Several of these proteins are important for efficient virus replication and serve to promote various steps in the life cycle. Others have been found to inhibit or restrict virus replication and thus serve as components of the innate immune system. Recent work has helped define the machinery responsible for silencing retroviral transcription in embryonic stem cells.Dr. Goff and his colleagues are analyzing the replication of the mammalian retroviruses, including the murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), to define the functions of each of the viral gene products and to identify host proteins with which the viruses interact.

VMy laboratory investigates the molecular processes controlling development of specialized cells in higher plants, specifically (1) organization of genes in the genome; (2) mechanisms that control the regulation of plant gene expression; (3) genes that control the differentiation of specific plant cell types; and (4) events that cause an undifferentiated cell to take on a specialized state. My laboratory has uncovered a gene, designated at TA29, that is required for pollen grain production. In collaboration with others we used the TA29 gene transcriptional control region to genetically engineer a system for male-fertility control in crop plants. This system is able to generate male-sterile plants and restore their fertility and allows development of new canola varieties with increased yield.   We are now using the scarlet runner bean as a genomics engine to uncover genes that are important for embryo and seed development. We have been micro-dissecting giant bean embryos into distinct regions and using EST sequencing and reverse genetic approaches in Arabidopsis to uncover genes that are important for controlling embryo development shortly after fertilization. The long-term goal is to identify all the genes required to make a seed.My laboratory investigates the molecular processes controlling development of specialized cells in higher plants, specifically (1) organization of genes in the genome; (2) mechanisms that control the regulation of plant gene expression; (3) genes that control the differentiation of specific plant cell types; and (4) events that cause an undifferentiated cell to take on a specialized state.

We have been micro-dissecting giant bean embryos into distinct regions and using EST sequencing and reverse genetic approaches in Arabidopsis to uncover genes that are important for controlling embryo development shortly after fertilization. The long-term goal is to identify all the genes required to make a seed.My laboratory investigates the molecular processes controlling development of specialized cells in higher plants, specifically (1) organization of genes in the genome; (2) mechanisms that control the regulation of plant gene expression; (3) genes that control the differentiation of specific plant cell types; and (4) events that cause an undifferentiated cell to take on a specialized state. My laboratory has uncovered a gene, designated at TA29, that is required for pollen grain production. In collaboration with others we used the TA29 gene transcriptional control region to genetically engineer a system for male-fertility control in crop plants. This system is able to generate male-sterile plants and restore their fertility and allows development of new canola varieties with increased yield.

VAs an economic historian and an economist I interpret "the present through the lens of the past." I mainly explore the origins of issues of current concern, such as the causes of increased female labor force participation, the impact of technological change on the wage structure, and the role of education in ameliorating inequality. I have also written on slavery, emancipation, the post-bellum southern economy, the family, war's economic impact, immigration, New Deal policies, and a host of topics concerning women. Much of my research in the past decade has concerned the rise of mass education in the United States from the nineteenth century and its impact on economic growth and inequality. I have continued researching various aspects of women's changing role and my most recent explorations have concerned the impact of "the pill" on women's career and marriage decisions, women's surnames after marriage as a social indicator, why women are now the majority of undergraduates, and the career and family tradeoffs faced by college women across the past century. I am just now embarking on a study of the family and career "transitions" of men and women who graduated from selective colleges from the late 1960s to the present.As an economic historian and an economist I interpret "the present through the lens of the past."

VAs an experimental condensed matter physicist most of my research has involved the investigation of superconductivity, primarily in the configuration of thin films, with emphasis on the study of fluctuation phenomena and the effects of disorder and dimensional constraints. The highlights of this research include the experimental determination of the pair field susceptibility of superconductors and the discovery of propagating order parameter collective modes in superconductors, the quantitative investigation of the Kosterllitz-Thouless-Berezinskii transition in two-dimensional superconductors, and the exploration of the disorder-, magnetic field-, and charge tuned- superconductor-insulator transitions in two dimensional systems. I also have worked on artificial superconducting structures fabricated using electron beam lithography, investigating the properties of fractal superconducting networks. Very recently I studied the discrete energy levels of nanometer scale metal clusters using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Together with students and postdocs, I developed molecular beam epitaxy techniques for growing superconducting and magnetic oxides using ozone as a source of oxygen. This technique has been used to prepare heterostructures combining magnetic and superconducting oxides, which have been used to study spin injection phenomena. I also performed some of the first quantitative studies of the density of states of high temperature superconductors using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.As an experimental condensed matter physicist most of my research has involved the investigation of superconductivity, primarily in the configuration of thin films, with emphasis on the study of fluctuation phenomena and the effects of disorder and dimensional constraints.

Some examples of research themes I have tackled are: how to incorporate randomness into the model and the design of efficiently verifiable mathematical proofs and use them to achieve secure communication protocols and a classification of the complexity of approximation problems; how to meaningfully relax the classical requirements made of a combinatorial testing algorithm to allow for error and gain feasibility in return.  Currently I am interested in understanding the minimal requirements on the limits of efficient of computation, that will allow for secure communication.As a theoretical computer scientist, I am motivated by real world challenges on the one hand and the beauty of mathematics and abstraction on the other.

VAs a geographer my research focuses on the nature of geographic information and fundamental problems of measurement, description, and analysis of phenomena on the surface of Earth. Geography is an ancient discipline, but the study of geographic information has been reinvigorated by the advent of remote-sensing satellites, geographic information systems, and the ability to measure location directly through the Global Positioning System. Much of my recent research has been on the problem of uncertainty in geographic information: its measurement, modeling, and visualization. The problem of uncertainty has emerged as a major issue because it is impossible to capture the full complexity of Earth's surface in a digital representation and impossible to measure location perfectly. I use spatial statistical models to understand the impacts of uncertainty on the widespread applications of geographic information. My research also includes digital libraries and problems associated with search, retrieval, and use of geographic information over the Internet; the potential for novel kinds of fieldwork enabled by fully mobile, wirelessly connected, and even wearable information technology; and the role of geographic information technologies in science and policy making.As a geographer my research focuses on the nature of geographic information and fundamental problems of measurement, description, and analysis of phenomena on the surface of Earth.

VMy major focus has been to determine how extracellular and intracellular signals are integrated to regulate gene expression. The cAMP regulated enhancer (CRE), initially identified in my laboratory, is now recognized as a critical control element in the regulation of many cellular and viral genes. Signals transduced by the CRE depend upon the transcription factor CREB, which is activated through cAMP, calcium, and growth factor pathways. CREB phosphorylation through these pathways leads to the recruitment of the CREB binding protein (CBP), which was also identified in my laboratory. CBP, the first example of a transcriptional coactivator in metazoans, interacts with a large number of transcription factors in addition to CREB. Consequently, alterations in CBP expression have profound effects on cell growth and differentiation.My major focus has been to determine how extracellular and intracellular signals are integrated to regulate gene expression.

VMy students and I are defining the properties of gut stem cells and how their daughters differentiate to form various cell types that line the mouse stomach and intestine. We use germ-free normal and genetically manipulated mice, colonized with the bacterial species that reside at various locations along the mouse and human gut, to study the molecular foundations of symbiotic and commensal host-microbial relationships. The results indicate that our microbial partners play an important role in shaping postnatal gut development and adult physiology. By determining how colonization of the gut influences both bacterial and host gene expression we are identifying the strategies that these indigenous microbes have developed to manipulate gut epithelial, immune, and neuronal cell populations. Knowledge of these strategies offers new ways for enhancing health and understanding the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. We also study N-myristoyltransferase (Nmt), a eukaryotic enzyme that adds a rare cellular fatty acid (myristate) to proteins involved in diverse and essential cellular processes. Survival of several human pathogens depends on N-myristoylation of their proteins, making their Nmts attractive therapeutic targets.My students and I are defining the properties of gut stem cells and how their daughters differentiate to form various cell types that line the mouse stomach and intestine.

Currently I am examining the role of introgressive hybridization in fueling genetic variation during early stages of adaptive radiations. The system being used for this study is the radiation of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands, where fourteen species have been derived from a common ancestor in the last two to three million years.I am interested in the process of speciation in nature.

VPeter Grant, together with his wife Rosemary, has been studying Darwin's finches on the Galapagos islands since 1973. The fieldwork is designed to understand the causes of an adaptive radiation. It combines analyses of archipelago-wide patterns of evolution with detailed investigations of population level processes of evolution on two islands, Genovesa and Daphne. The work is a blend of ecology, behavior and genetics. They have collaborated with investigators to estimate phylogenetic relations among the species of finches and their relatives on the continent and in the Caribbean, and to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of beaks that vary so conspicuously among the species. The work has been published in three books, most recently (2007) in "How and Why Species Multiply". Peter Grant is the Class of 1877 Professor of Zoology in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University Department. He trained at Cambridge University and the University of British Columbia. Before joining Princeton in 1986 he taught at McGill University and the University of Michigan.

VAs a computational biologist I develop mathematical, statistical, and computer methods for analyzing the genomes of humans and other organisms. My coworkers and I have written a number of software packages that have been widely used to make physical and genetic maps, to process and assemble DNA sequencing data, and to identify genes and other biological features in genome sequences. Our current interests center on the problem of identifying the complete "parts list," the set of all proteins encoded in the genome.

VAs a microbiologist I have been interested in the social behavior of bacteria. A primary focus has been on the coordination of activities in groups of bacteria. A main focus of my work has been on cell-to-cell communication and a phenomenon that is known as quorum sensing. Many bacteria use chemical signals as cues to coordinate activities of individuals in groups. This allows population density dependent differential gene expression, and it can function in the development of specialized sessile communities known as biofilms. Signaling plays a critical role in the development of chronic and persistent bacterial infections. Investigators in my laboratory have determined the structures of several signal molecules, elucidated the mechanism of signal synthesis, and studied how the signals activate gene expression. Our current research examines the role of cell-to-cell signaling in bacterial virulence, and the basic mechanisms of the signaling process. Our work is currently focused on the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and how this bacterium adapts phenotypically and genetically for persistence in the lungs of people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis. We are also interested in self vs non-self discrimination in bacteria.As a microbiologist I have been interested in the social behavior of bacteria.

VOur interactions with the outside world trigger changes at neuronal synapses that are critical for brain development and higher cognitive function. Our research has focused on the identification of a genetic program that is activated by neuronal activity, the signal transduction mechanisms that carry the activity-dependent signal from the membrane to the nucleus, and the identification of regulators of this experience-dependent process that affect synapse development and plasticity. We are particularly interested in activity-dependent processes whose dysfunction can lead to the development of human diseases of cognition such as autism and mental retardation.Using global screening techniques to identify proteins whose activity is regulated by stimuli such as membrane depolarization and calcium influx in neurons, we have identified a number of genes that regulate processes such as dendritic arborization, spine development, protein interactions, local control of protein translation at the synapse by micro-RNAs, and the relative number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Many disorders of cognition are correlated with changes in the number of synapses or an imbalance between excitation and inhibition in the nervous system. Thus, understanding the activity-dependent mechanisms that govern synaptic development may reveal how the deregulation of this process leads to neurological diseases.Our interactions with the outside world trigger changes at neuronal synapses that are critical for brain development and higher cognitive function.

VAs an experimental condensed matter physicist, I study quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level in materials that are "strongly correlated electron systems". In particular, I primarily investigate the mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity by planar tunneling and point-contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectroscopies. These measurements are used to map out the electronic structure of high-temperature, heavy-fermion, and other unconventional superconductors. In high-temperature superconductivity, my work on atomic substitutions, thin-film growth, and planar tunneling demonstrated the existence of Andreev bound states and various symmetry breakings, including time-reversal. My recent work using PCAR in heavy-fermion superconductors has revealed exciting competition between phases, including superconducting and antiferromagnetic, and that theories beyond those existing are needed to describe the Andreev process at the heavy fermion superconducting interface.As an experimental condensed matter physicist, I study quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level in materials that are "strongly correlated electron systems".

VThe primary focus of my work is computational mathematics, especially the solution of the partial differential equations of classical physics: i.e. the equations governing electrostatics, heat conduction, fluid flow, anmd wave propagation. Much of my group's effort is concerned with the development of fast and adaptive algorithms for these equations as they arise in specific problems in materials science, biology, physics and chemistry. The first such algorithm was the fast multipole method (FMM), developed during the 1980s in collaboration with V. Rokhlin. The FMM is most easily understood, perhaps, in the case of particle simulations. It reduces the cost of computing all pairwise (electrostatic or gravitational) interactions in a system of N particles from O(N2) to O(N) or O(N logN) operations. For systems with one million particles, one thousand-fold speedups are typically achieved, making previously intractable calculations feasible. By recasting the partial differential equations of classical physics as integral equations, we have developed variants of the FMM that allow for the solution of the Poisson, linearized Poisson-Boltzmann, Helmholtz, and Maxwell equations in nearly optimal time in complex geometry. They are now widely used in chip design, computational chemistry, and high frequency electromagnetic scattering.The primary focus of my work is computational mathematics, especially the solution of the partial differential equations of classical physics: i.e. the equations governing electrostatics, heat conduction, fluid flow, anmd wave propagation.

VTelomeres and telomerase: basic mechanisms and clinical applications Dr. Greider's research is focused on the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome stability and segregation. Cancer cells are characterized by chromosomes instability and rearrangments. Telomerase, the enzyme necessary to maintain telomere length, is expressed in human tumor cells but not found in many normal human tissues and is required for long term growth of many tumor cells. Telomerase may be an excellent target for new anti-cancer therapies. Biochemical studies are underway in the lab to understand the detailed mechanism of this unusual DNA polymerase. To understand the role of telomeres and chromosome stability, the Greider lab has been studying a telomerase knockout mouse. When telomeres become too short, cells die. This induced cells death is exactly what one would hope from a telomerase inhibitor. Studies are now underway to understand the pathway that signals cell death when telomeres become short. To fully understand the pathways by which cells respond to short telomeres they are also characterizing the growth arrest and chromosomal changes that occur in yeast when telomeres become short. These basic studies of the consequences of telomere dysfunction provide a fundamental understanding of telomere biology necessary to evaluate how best to target telomerase cancer chemotherapy.Telomeres and telomerase: basic mechanisms and clinical applications Dr. Greider's research is focused on the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome stability and segregation.

VDiane Griffin's laboratory is interested in the pathogenesis of viral infections and has studied the determinants of outcome and the host responses to infection. They have examined disease caused by acute infection with two different types of RNA viruses: encephalomyelitis due to a mosquito-borne alphavirus and the rash disease measles. To understand viral encephalitis they have used a mouse model to determine how virus infects and damages neurons and how the host immune response controls virus replication without damaging cells. Noncytolytic clearance by antibody and T cells results in long-term persistence of viral RNA in the nervous system. Measles virus infection causes death primarily by increasing susceptibility to other infections. Recovery is accompanied by lifelong immunity to re-infection. Using a rhesus macaque model,they have shown that virus clearance continues for months after apparent recovery. Virus persistence probably leads to both immune suppression and development of long-term immunity to measles. Clearance is dependent on both the virus-specific cellular immune response and antibody.Diane Griffin's laboratory is interested in the pathogenesis of viral infections and has studied the determinants of outcome and the host responses to infection.

These points are the classes of divisors supported on points of complex multiplication, and our formula constitutes a modern chapter in the history of that subject.

VI am a field geologist interested in the evolution of Earth's surficial environments and biosphere. My research addresses the chemical development of the early oceans and atmosphere, the environmental context of early animal evolution, and the geologic factors that regulate sedimentary basins. I have worked on establishing the basic geologic framework of a number of sedimentary basins and orogenic belts in northwest Canada, northern Siberia, southern Africa, and the western United States. These field-mapping studies are the starting point for more topical laboratory studies involving geochemical, paleontological, and geochronological techniques. Currently my research is focused on the reconstruction of environmental conditions associated with the Cambrian radiation of animals. Work in Oman, Namibia, and Siberia suggests that radiation of Cambrian animals may have coincided with extinction of Precambrian animals, brought on by an episode of global ocean anoxia. Other research involves simulation of stromatolite morphogenesis and the evaluation of the role of microorganisms in stromatolite growth.I am a field geologist interested in the evolution of Earth's surficial environments and biosphere.

VMy laboratory investigates the relationships among chromatin structure, transcriptional activators, and the regulation of gene expression during cellular differentiation. Using the human and mouse beta-globin loci as models, our work suggests a multi-step model for gene activation, involving alterations in the nuclear location of the loci and transactivators, followed by high-level transcription of the beta-globin genes. In addition, our analysis of enhancer function suggests that these elements antagonize gene silencing by establishing and/or maintaining domains permissive for transcription, as well as preventing localization of a gene near heterochromatin.My laboratory investigates the relationships among chromatin structure, transcriptional activators, and the regulation of gene expression during cellular differentiation.

VGenes function in the context of chromosomes in living cells and I have studied how chromosomal structures regulate gene activity in the model eukaryotic organism, baker's yeast. DNA in a eukaryotic cell is folded around molecular spools or nucleosomes that are composed of histone proteins. By depleting histones in yeast cells my lab showed that histones repress gene activity in living cells. How then are genes activated when histones are present? We found that certain amino acids that are sites of acetylation, a post-translational modification of histones, are required for gene expression. Therefore, histone acetylation sites regulate the repressive role of the nucleosome. My lab also found that histones help organize large silent chromosomal regions, termed heterochromatin, by serving as binding sites for heterochromatin-specific protein regulators. This enabled a better understanding of the mechanism by which heterochromatin proteins spread along the chromosome and how histone deacetylation regulates that spreading. A major goal in our laboratory now is to determine how histones and their post-translational modifications interact with other factors to regulate gene activity, DNA replication and heterochromatin structure. These results then help us design experiments to study how histone modifications help regulate human cell differentiation.Genes function in the context of chromosomes in living cells and I have studied how chromosomal structures regulate gene activity in the model eukaryotic organism, baker's yeast.

VAs a molecular endocrinologist I have studied mechanisms of steroid hormone action. My laboratory purified the first nuclear receptor (the glucocorticoid receptor GR) to homogeneity. We defined the three-domain structure of GR, laying the basis for much of our current understanding of nuclear receptor structure. In collaboration with Keith Yamamoto my laboratory found specific binding of GR to the glucocorticoid responsive MMTV genome. The specific DNA binding sites for GR turned out to functionally represent glucocorticoid response elements, a novel concept at the time. Continued collaboration with Yamamoto led to the first (partial) cloning of a nuclear receptor (GR), based on antibodies developed in my laboratory. In collaboration with structural biochemists I solved the 3-D structure of the GR DNA-binding domain (DBD), which turned out to be representative of all other nuclear receptor DBDs. Structural work on the ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor ER alpha revealed the molecular mechanism of estrogen antagonism. More recently my interest in estrogen signaling has deepened, following the discovery in my laboratory of ER beta. This receptor has important functions in reproduction, the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, and hematopoiesis.As a molecular endocrinologist I have studied mechanisms of steroid hormone action.

VAs an economic anthropologist, my career of research centers on the interface between the economic life of populations and the formal sector institutions - states, urban administrations, banks and markets - of western capitalism, primarily in Africa. Starting in Nigeria in the late 1960s and later in Cameroon, one line of enquiry focuses on agricultural production for rapidly expanding urban and international markets, with particular attention to the gender division of resource control, labor and income, and to the place of governance in economic life (regulation, taxation). I have studied both agro-ecological and socio-political change over the twentieth century, and followed my first research site over forty years, extending to comparative study and use of remote sensing. This work culminates in a depiction of an indigenous West African mode of growth. From 1980 I developed a second strand of research on price, value and monetary practices in West Africa and beyond, using ethnography, archives, museum collections and sources in the humanities. This work has resulted in a series of publications focused on a) empirically-based theory of persistent interfaces in the monetary world, b) empirical documentation of the experience of monetary turbulence, and c) cultures of monetarism since its ascendancy from the 1980s.As an economic anthropologist, my career of research centers on the interface between the economic life of populations and the formal sector institutions - states, urban administrations, banks and markets - of western capitalism, primarily in Africa.

VI study spin effects in nuclear processes and in fundamental interactions. The development of ion sources producing polarized protons and deuterons found a wide range of applications by my group, such as spin effects in nucleon-nucleon scattering, effects of the deuteron D-state in nuclear interactions and new methods of angular momentum assignments. Other applications of polarized beams that I pursued with collaborators at ETZZurich were studies of symmetry violations: parity violation in hadronic interactions and a search for time-reversal violation in the beta decay of polarized nuclei. More recently my group developed gas targets of pure, spin-polarized hydrogen and deuterium atoms. These targets are rather dilute and were not practical until the advent of very intense circulating beams in storage rings, into which the targets are inserted. We were able to show that atoms produced by an atomic-beam method can be confined to a target tube for several milliseconds, thus increasing the target thickness by about a factor of 100 compared to use of the free atomic jet. These storage cell targets turned out to be highly effective for experiments in proton and electron storage rings, which we carry out at other laboratories with collaborators from many institutions.I study spin effects in nuclear processes and in fundamental interactions.

VAs a laser scientist I am exploring nonlinear interactions between coherent light and matter. My early work in laser spectroscopy includes the invention of the first practical narrowband tunable dye laser, the development of now commonly used techniques for Doppler-free laser spectroscopy, and the first proposal for laser cooling of atomic gases. My focus has long been precision spectroscopy of the simple hydrogen atom that permits unique confrontations between experiment and fundamental theory. This work has yielded accurate values of the Rydberg constant, the Lamb shift of the hydrogen ground state, and the charge radii of proton and deuteron. After recent dramatic advances these experiments appear now poised to reveal possible slow changes of fundamental constants or even differences between matter and antimatter. More recently, my coworkers and I have been exploring atomic lattices bound by light. We are creating and manipulating coherent matter waves with microfabricated "atom chips" and we have pioneered a revolutionary simple technique for measuring the frequency of light with ultrashort pulses.As a laser scientist I am exploring nonlinear interactions between coherent light and matter.

VAs a geographer, my particular interest has been in mapping how shocks are transmitted through spatial systems. My earliest work was on diffusion waves in the spatial economy, extending the pioneering work of the Lund geographer, Torsten Hagerstrand, through modelling multiple or recurring waves rather than single events. Emphasis was on adapting deterministic and probalistic wave models to include spatial or regional elements so as to allow place-specific projections (using both conventional and multidimensional mapping methods). From 1970 this work was focussed on analysis of epidemiological data, tracking the wave behaviour of contagious diseases passing through spatially-distributed human populations. In this context, extensive use have been made of worldwide records of island epidemics since 1850 with special emphasis on the unique historical disease records of Iceland in the North Atlantic and the Fijian island group in the South Pacific. Results have been reported in a series of research monographs and in map format in three major epidemiological atlases. The specific research has provided a broad platform for more extensive studies in which the role of locational analysis and regional science have been explored as part of a wider geographical synthesis.As a geographer, my particular interest has been in mapping how shocks are transmitted through spatial systems.

VOur research group has used genetics to study development in plants. We cloned the first developmental gene in plants, knotted1 (kn1), which led to a molecular tool to study the meristem. We showed that kn1 is expressed throughout the meristem, but not in the cells that will initiate the leaf, thus marking the transition from indeterminate to determinate fates. When kn1 is misexpressed in the leaf and in other plants, dramatically new morphologies ensue. Some of the direct targets of this homeobox transcription factor are genes that produce or regulate plant hormones. Our interest in the meristem has also led to studies of the flower-bearing structures in plants, the inflorescence. By positionally cloning maize mutants, we have identified a number of genes that regulate the degree of branching in maize. Most of the genes encode transcription factors that function in defined groups of cells in the inflorescence, but some of them encode microRNAs. More recently, we are starting to look at the interplay of natural diversity in maize with mutant alleles, thus identifying additional genes that play minor but significant roles in development.Our research group has used genetics to study development in plants.

VI have developed technologies for isolation and structural characterization of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), which have resulted in establishment of many new GSLs, particularly the extended globo-series and extended and/or branched lacto-series structures (including A1, A2, B, H, Forssman, and I/i antigens), and their changes associated with ontogenic development and oncogenic transformation. Along this line of studies, I and my colleagues established structures of many tumor-associated antigens expressed in experimental tumors and human cancers, which provide the basis for diagnosis and vaccine development. Some of the tumor-associated GSL antigens are adhesion molecules and promote tumor metastasis. As an initial step in providing a genetic basis of glycosylation, we cloned genes for blood group A and B transferases and elucidated the structures of ABO alleles. We found that GSLs, particularly gangliosides, are modulators of signal transduction through interaction with tyrosine kinases, and identified GSLs themselves as adhesion molecules when clustered in GSL microdomains organized with signal transducer molecules. Thus, cell adhesion based on GSL-to-GSL or GSL-to-ligand interaction at the microdomain causes activation of Src family kinases and small G-proteins, and simultaneously modulates cellular phenotype.I have developed technologies for isolation and structural characterization of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), which have resulted in establishment of many new GSLs, particularly the extended globo-series and extended and/or branched lacto-series structures (including A1, A2, B, H, Forssman, and I/i antigens), and their changes associated with ontogenic development and oncogenic transformation.

VI and co-workers have studied behavior in Drosophila from the perspective of genetically defined tissue substrates of the animal's actions, as well as how mutationally identified genes point to the cellular and molecular mechanisms subserving, on the one hand, reproductive behavior and, on the other, biological rhythmicity. Our courtship studies have included identifying portions of the central nervous system that must be genetically male or female in order that sex-specific behaviors occur; analysis of a key gene whose actions within these CNS regions are responsible for essentially all components of male-specific behavior; discovering that elements of Drosophila courtship involve learning and memory (followed by genetic analysis of these conditioned behaviors); performing the first foray into reverse-neurogenetics in this model system; neuro-molecular analysis of a putative "master regulator" of sexual differentiation in the CNS; and identification of genes encoding ion-channel proteins that regulate the fly's ability to generate courtship song sounds. Our discovery that a salient feature of singing behavior is rhythmic provided the entree into our broader-ranging investigations of biological rhythmicity. These studies have included (co)identification of the first "clock gene" isolated in any organism; uncovering how the products of this gene act to form a central component of the circadian-pacemaker mechanism; extending this chronogenetic story by mutationally and molecularly identifying an appreciable proportion of the other genes in Drosophila that function either "within" the clock, mediate daily clock-resetting environmental inputs to the system, or send outputs from central pacemaking into regulation of the animal's overt biological rhythms.I and co-workers have studied behavior in Drosophila from the perspective of genetically defined tissue substrates of the animal's actions, as well as how mutationally identified genes point to the cellular and molecular mechanisms subserving, on the one hand, reproductive behavior and, on the other, biological rhythmicity.

These studies have included (co)identification of the first "clock gene" isolated in any organism; uncovering how the products of this gene act to form a central component of the circadian-pacemaker mechanism; extending this chronogenetic story by mutationally and molecularly identifying an appreciable proportion of the other genes in Drosophila that function either "within" the clock, mediate daily clock-resetting environmental inputs to the system, or send outputs from central pacemaking into regulation of the animal's overt biological rhythms.I and co-workers have studied behavior in Drosophila from the perspective of genetically defined tissue substrates of the animal's actions, as well as how mutationally identified genes point to the cellular and molecular mechanisms subserving, on the one hand, reproductive behavior and, on the other, biological rhythmicity.

VMy research spans a variety of topics in applied microeconomics. My work tries to stay in close contact with facts and data about modern economies, almost exclusively the U.S. economy. Throughout my career, I've been interested in an improved understanding of recessions. Most of my research on this topic has focused on the labor market. The most important feature of a recession is a dramatic rise in unemployment. From the start, I have thought about unemployment in a dynamic setting-for the great majority of workers, unemployment lasts only a few months, but there are always some people unemployed. My recent work has shown that, in today's economy, unemployment does not rise in a recession because of a bulge of layoffs. Instead, it rises because job-seekers take much longer to find new jobs. My work on this topic examines the incentives facing employers and workers to invest in job-creating activities. I have a related interest in the stock market, where values are even more puzzlingly volatile than is the rate of unemployment. I have shown that variations in stock-market returns are vastly larger than variations in the returns to the underlying activities of companies listed in the market.     A third interest is in tax policy. I've designed and promoted a tax simplification plan that starts from the principle of the value-added tax-the backbone of European consumption taxation-but creates a progressive version that excuses the poor from any burden of the tax.My research spans a variety of topics in applied microeconomics.

VAs a geographer I have concentrated on the relationship between people and the urban built environment in two detailed studies. The first, on people's everyday travel-activity patterns, examined the way that different groups make use of the city and showed how urban spatial structure configures household travel. This study reconceptualized travel as being rooted in spatially and temporally complex activity patterns. The second, on gender and urban labor markets, focused on occupational segregation, geographic opportunity structures, and connections between work and home. This study identified the spatial processes by which individuals, households, and firms--through their daily rounds of interactions--create and maintain labor market inequalities. It also developed the concept of geographic rootedness and demonstrated its importance by documenting how conditions of fixed location shape human capital formation and the emergence of segmented labor markets. My current work is proceeding along two lines: One seeks to understand how gender, geographic opportunity structures, and geographic rootedness affect entrepreneurship in cities. The other seeks to understand the emergence of sustainable versus unsustainable practices in urban areas.As a geographer I have concentrated on the relationship between people and the urban built environment in two detailed studies.

VMy research centers on the role of timing in the healthy and diseased human brain. We follow brain's activation sequences with millisecond accuracy using nonivasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) that my colleagues and I have been developing over two decades. In addition to addressing timing during sensory and cognitive processing, often combined with behavioral measures, we have clarified the functional role of several brain rhythms, most recently the oscillatory drive from the motor cortex to the muscles. The latest studies, some of them in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), tackle the brain basis of acute and chronic pain. With a background in clinical neurophysiology, I have attempted to develop new tools for functional preoperative evaluation. My colleagues and I have also elucidated the neuronal origin of numerous electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, with the aim to promote their reliable clinical use. Presently, I am interested in shared motor and sensory representations between individuals: what happens in our brains when we see other persons acting and feeling? My dream would be to study brain basis of social interaction in real-time.My research centers on the role of timing in the healthy and diseased human brain.

VResearch projects in my group concern, first, the study of the statistical or dynamical basis of chemical reactions in liquids on the femtosecond time scale and the dynamics and properties of electrons on surfaces and at interfaces. Using femtosecond two-photon photoemissions, I can excite electrons from a metal substrate into states associated with an adjacent interface. Photoemission of the interfacial electrons with a second femtosecond pulse allows me to follow the electron dynamics in real time. These methods enable me to study the dynamics of electrons interacting with condensed matter in 2-D and determine how the properties change as the system evolves into a 3-D structure.  In the second area I use femtosecond infrared, ultraviolet, and visible spectroscopic methods to investigate the dynamics of complex chemical reactions in solution. The most basic reactions in solution share certain reaction processes, which include dissociation, recombination, solvent caging, molecular morphology changes, and system-solvent interaction. These molecular events occur on ultrafast (10-13-10-10 s) timescales. In many instances the theoretical basis for the experiments and observations must also be developed. My graduate students thus can obtain their Ph.D. with a strong background in both theory and experiment.Research projects in my group concern, first, the study of the statistical or dynamical basis of chemical reactions in liquids on the femtosecond time scale and the dynamics and properties of electrons on surfaces and at interfaces.

VAs a microbiologist I have studied mechanisms used by bacteria to degrade environmental pollutants and to sense and respond to environmental signals. My laboratory elucidated the main metabolic pathway used to biodegrade compounds with benzene rings in the absence of oxygen. We also established that bacteria can sense and swim towards a wide range of environmental pollutants including benzene, toluene, naphthalene, trichloroethylene and the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. This ability to behaviorally respond to pollutants is a key component enhancing their biodegradation. These results led me to investigate the Wsp signal transduction system in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We showed that this system regulates biofilm formation by modulating intracellular levels of cyclic diguanylate (c-diGMP) and thus identified c-diGMP as an attractive target for developing new drugs to combat chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients. More recently I have worked on developing a metabolically versatile phototrophic bacterium named Rhodopseudomonas palustris, as a model organism for the production of hydrogen gas as a non-polluting energy source. This work involves understanding how bacteria integrate diverse environmental signals and diverse metabolic modules to perform a function that may be useful to humans.As a microbiologist I have studied mechanisms used by bacteria to degrade environmental pollutants and to sense and respond to environmental signals.

VMy research lies at the interface of mathematics, computer science, and molecular biology-developing new computational methods to explore the molecular evolution and functional elements of the human genome. This research direction has been made possible through my collaboration on the Human Genome Project, during which my team posted to the Internet the first publicly available assembly of the human genome sequence. We developed this into an interactive web browser for multiple genome sequences (www.genome.ucsc.edu), which is used extensively in basic and biomedical research, including my own. My recent research focuses on broadly exploring the functional elements of the human genome, primarily by using high-throughput genomics data for interspecies comparisons and then testing the resulting findings experimentally. This research sheds light on the possible functionality of what was once considered to be "junk" DNA, of genomic elements that have been conserved with remarkable fidelity throughout evolution, and of genomic regions that have undergone rapid evolution in the human lineage. One such rapidly evolving genome sequence identified in my laboratory seems to play a role in the development of the human cerebral cortex, a region of the brain that has expanded dramatically in relation to our predecessors. One of my aims is to build realistic and information-rich mathematical models that reflect the full spectrum of events in mammalian molecular evolution. To this end, I have begun to computationally reconstruct the genome of the ancestor common to placental mammals.My research lies at the interface of mathematics, computer science, and molecular biology-developing new computational methods to explore the molecular evolution and functional elements of the human genome.

VAs an ethnographer I have studied age and sex variation in food acquisition and distribution among hunter-gatherers. These observations, combined with the fossil and archaeological record and comparative data on other primates, direct my questions about what happened in human evolution. Aspects of human foraging strategies are consistent with simple caloric rate maximization models and also challenge ideas about nuclear families as basic units of economic cooperation. In my studies, men's hunting serves goals other than family provisioning. Risk of failure can be high and meat of a successful capture is distributed widely outside the hunter's family. The hunter earns less nutritional gain for his own family than if he had targeted other resources. Reputation benefits may help explain why hunters work to provide more public than private goods.  Age variation in human foraging behavior highlights the late maturity and slow senescence of our species. Observations of older women provisioning grandchildren suggest that our unusual longevity evolved when an ancestral ecology promoted use of foods difficult for youngsters to handle. More vigorous aging females could then increase their daughters' fertility by helping feed grandchildren. Since maturation and aging rates are correlated across the mammals, this line of reasoning makes our longevity the foundation for the age structure of human populations. It motivates my developing interest in cross-species differences in the physiology of aging.As an ethnographer I have studied age and sex variation in food acquisition and distribution among hunter-gatherers.

VPrincipally, I map the large-scale distribution of matter in the local universe and investigate the interplay between the evolutionary histories of spiral galaxies and their environment. I participated in the early use of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) telescope for extragalactic atomic hydrogen line spectroscopy and exploited that technique to map the detailed structure and extent of the Pisces-Perseus supercluster. The neutral hydrogen content was used to demonstrate the stripping of interstellar gas by the hot intracluster medium in rich clusters. Even isolated galaxies show evidence for ongoing evolution, such as counter-rotating gas and stellar disks. My recent efforts have exploited a combination of radio and optical datasets to determine distances to galaxies in the local universe by redshift-independent means, thereby allowing measurement of departures from smooth Hubble expansion. Derivation of the peculiar velocity field allows the reconstruction of the underlying density field. These studies have shown that, in the local universe, light does trace mass and that the dipole anisotropy seen in the cosmic microwave background is induced by galaxies within about 6,000 kilometers per second, the local convergence depth.Principally, I map the large-scale distribution of matter in the local universe and investigate the interplay between the evolutionary histories of spiral galaxies and their environment.

VMy colleagues and I have done pioneering research in the area of highly conducting organic solids with emphasis on the class of materials known as semiconducting and metallic polymers. My research interests have focused on the development of the fundamental physics and chemistry that determine the electronic and optical properties of semiconducting and metallic polymers with the goal of making these novel materials available for applications in technology. I was a founder of UNIAX Corporation in 1990 and am now chief scientist. UNIAX, acquired in 1990 by DuPont, is focusing on bringing polymer displays into commercial products. More recently, I have initiated studies of conjugated polyelectrolytes and the use of such conjugated polyelectrolytes in the area of biosensors, that is, water-soluble semiconducting, luminescent polymers (and oligomers) covalently bonded to biospecific ligands as the active materials.My colleagues and I have done pioneering research in the area of highly conducting organic solids with emphasis on the class of materials known as semiconducting and metallic polymers.

VI have studied the dynamics of the Earth's climate, with particular interests in the planetary-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation, climate sensitivity, and various aspects of geophysical turbulence. As a theorist, I have primarily developed and studied idealized dynamical systems that help us understand some of the basic features of our climate, such as the size of the Hadley circulation in the tropics, the poleward energy transport by the macroturbulence of the midlatitude atmosphere, the organization of midlatitude cyclones into wave packets, the deviations from zonal (east-west) symmetry of the climate on large scales caused by orography and land-ocean thermal contrasts, and the efficiency of the atmosphere when viewed as a heat engine. In recent years I have also been active as part of a team developing new comprehensive climate simulation models, primarily for global warming studies, an experience that has reinforced in my own mind the importance of spanning the gap between idealized theory and high-end simulations through a hierarchy of climate models of increasing complexity.I have studied the dynamics of the Earth's climate, with particular interests in the planetary-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation, climate sensitivity, and various aspects of geophysical turbulence.

VMy research interests have largely been driven by a desire to understand the connections between classical and quantum mechanics, and by the applications of those relationships as intuitive and computational tools.  Chemistry is a lively area for such connections, and understanding chemical processes such as molecular spectroscopy and tunneling has been aided by the ''semiclassical'' studies we have undertaken. The subject of classical chaos and its implications for quantum systems is a major theme, as is scattering theory in classical and quantum mechanics, and cold atoms and molecules. Semiconductor electron wave investigations and ocean wave physics are also strong interests; these also derive significant insight from classical-quantum (ray-wave) correspondence. Decoherence is often the agent of classical behavior of quantum systems, and this too is now a significant part of our efforts.My research interests have largely been driven by a desire to understand the connections between classical and quantum mechanics, and by the applications of those relationships as intuitive and computational tools.

VAs a seismologist, I have been attempting to understand seismograms.  Although seismographs have been around for 100 years, they have only recently been able to record Great Earthquakes locally and globally broadband (.001 Hz to 20 Hz).  My students and I have been attempting to model these motions in terms of faulting complexity (source excitation) and wave-propagational features (path effects). A window of data from 30 degrees to 85 degrees (teleseismic) samples the relatively simple mid-mantle, which allows a clear view of earthquake properties. We have developed earthquake modeling tools that includes the wave-field interaction with the Earth's surface along the faults and allows determination of faulting parameters from such data.  We have also developed methods of modeling the strong motion shaking and static offset field (InSAR and GPS) locally, with models compatible with teleseismic results.  Using these detailed source descriptions, we can concentrate on modeling waveforms in terms of propagational complexity and sample regions that produce the more interesting tomographic images in the earth.  In some regions of the lowermost mantle beneath historic subduction zones, we discovered sharp horizontal boundaries which appears to agree with a recently discovered perovskite to post-perovskite phase change; while in other regions, we find vertical boundaries (thermal-chemical plumes) and in some places ultra-low-velocity zones (melts).As a seismologist, I have been attempting to understand seismograms.

VMy research explores the behavior of materials over a broad range of conditions from ambient to ultrahigh pressures. This work applies new experimental techniques for investigating materials to >300 GPa (3 million atmospheres) and from millikelvin to >5000 K, together with theoretical methods, to a variety of problems in Earth and planetary science, chemistry and physics, materials science and technology, and most recently biology. Current interests include understanding hydrogen at megabar pressures, a longstanding problem in physical science; transformations in Earth and planetary materials at high pressures and temperatures and their implications for the interiors of the Earth and other planets; observations of new transformations in molecular systems and novel high-pressure molecular compounds; the creation of new materials under pressure, including superconductors, magnetic structures, and superhard materials; the novel behavior of glasses and amorphous solids under pressure; and pressure effects on biomolecules and biological systems. Finally, I am involved in the continued development of new high-pressure techniques, including opposed-anvil methods, micro-optical techniques, synchrotron diffraction and spectroscopy, neutron scattering, and transport methods.My research explores the behavior of materials over a broad range of conditions from ambient to ultrahigh pressures.

VMy research interests are in computer architecture, specifically the design of high-performance computing systems. In the earlier part of my career I investigated instruction set architecture and contributed to the design of RISC architectures, as well as the underlying compilers to make effective use of such architectures. Since the late 1980s my research has focused on multiprocessor architectures and the accompanying software systems. Much of my attention has been addressed to the challenge of scaling shared-memory computing models to larger processor counts. I have also done work on comparisons of alternative architectural models and the programming approaches for these models. In high-performance computing systems the hardware and software are highly interdependent, and one cannot adequately evaluate architecture or a software system without a detailed understanding of the other. Thus, my interests have naturally included all aspects of the architecture (e.g., memory model, latency tolerance, synchronization support) as well as the programming systems for parallel computers, including programming models, programming languages, and compilers.My research interests are in computer architecture, specifically the design of high-performance computing systems.

VAs a theoretical astrophysicist, I have studied the formation and evolution of galaxies and the nature of the matter lying between galaxies known as the intergalactic medium (IGM). In particular, using numerical simulations, I demonstrated that the pattern of absorption features in the spectra of distant quasars know as the Lyman-alpha forest is produced by diffuse gas in the IGM lying in filamentary structures sometimes referred to as the Cosmic Web. These results show that the Lyman-alpha forest maps onto density fluctuations along sightlines to quasars, making it possible to measure the growth of cosmic structure with time, providing tests for theories of the matter evolution of the Universe, and enabling measurements of basic cosmological parameters. By employing simulations on smaller scales, I have shown that collisions between gas-rich galaxies drive inflows of gas into the centers of merger remnants. These dense, massive concentrations of gas fuel episodes of rapid star formation (starbursts), explaining the nature of peculiar, infrared-luminous galaxies and providing the raw material to grow supermassive black holes in galaxy centers. The energy produced by the growth of these black holes can account for the luminosities and lifetimes of quasars, the most energetic sources in the Universe. Moreover, the relics of this process, central collections of stars and inactive black holes, explain the structure and properties of elliptical galaxies, demonstrating that galaxy mergers are a key ingredient in shaping galaxies.As a theoretical astrophysicist, I have studied the formation and evolution of galaxies and the nature of the matter lying between galaxies known as the intergalactic medium (IGM).

VAs a plant biologist, I have studied the molecular mechanisms that allow plants, as sessile organisms, to cope with a continuously changing environment. The molecular responses to light, as a source of energy and a developmental signal, and nutrient availability are two fundamental processes that we have studied. To facilitate these studies we first had to develop gene transfer technology to produce transgenic plants. Using the natural gene transfer system of the soil bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we were able to generate a reproducible system to introduce genes into plants cells that could be regenerated into mature plants.  Using this system, we were able to identify DNA regulatory elements that allow plants to turn on genes in response to light stimuli and the protein sequence present in many of the corresponding gene products that allow their entry into the chloroplast, where they participate in the process of photosynthesis. More recently, my laboratory has shown that the release of organic acids into the soil plays an important role in making plants capable of utilizing insoluble nutrient forms. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms that allow plants to sense nutrient availability and the genes involved in changing the architecture of the root system to allow plants the exploration of novel soil domains to facilitate nutrient acquisition.As a plant biologist, I have studied the molecular mechanisms that allow plants, as sessile organisms, to cope with a continuously changing environment.

VI have been interested in the problem of how proteins are degraded in cells in a selective and regulated fashion. By the use of biochemical approaches, it was found in my laboratory that proteins are marked for degradation by attachment to a small protein, called ubiquitin. We have furthermore discribed several enzymes which catalyze biochemical reactions of the ubiquitin system for protein degradation. The most important of these are ubiquitin-protein ligases, or E3 enzymes, which recognize specific features in certain proteins and target them for degradation at the right time. More recently, I am investigating the roles of several ubiquitin-protein ligases in the control of cell division. Recent work in many laboratories has shown that ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is involved in many basic biological processes, such as the control of cell proliferation, signal transduction, development, the immune response and the inflammatory response.I have been interested in the problem of how proteins are degraded in cells in a selective and regulated fashion.

VThe main emphasis of the research of Karl Hess is on the theory and simulation of electronic transport in semiconductors and semiconductor devices and, more generally on numerical simulation and computational electronics. He has discovered real space transfer of hot electrons and has developed, with his graduate students, the full band Monte Carlo method which represents currently the most accurate simulation method for nonlinear electronic transport in semiconductors and semiconductor devices. He also has introduced modern semiconductor laser diode simulation and developed the simulator MINILASE, again together with his graduate students. Some of his research has been dedicated to the simulation of hot electron degradation and the reliability of CMOS devices (after his co-discovery, with J. Lyding, of the increase of transistor and chip lifetime by deuterium anneal) and to the reliability of thin oxides in semiconductor technology. Among his major recent research interests are electronic structure of and electronic transport in semiconductor nanostructures, particularly carbon nanotubes, and the conductance of biological ion channels.

Karl Hess is also increasingly interested in Quantum Information and Quantum Computing and how the theorems of the foundations of physic, particularly the theorem of Bell, relate to these areas.The main emphasis of the research of Karl Hess is on the theory and simulation of electronic transport in semiconductors and semiconductor devices and, more generally on numerical simulation and computational electronics. He has discovered real space transfer of hot electrons and has developed, with his graduate students, the full band Monte Carlo method which represents currently the most accurate simulation method for nonlinear electronic transport in semiconductors and semiconductor devices. He also has introduced modern semiconductor laser diode simulation and developed the simulator MINILASE, again together with his graduate students. Some of his research has been dedicated to the simulation of hot electron degradation and the reliability of CMOS devices (after his co-discovery, with J. Lyding, of the increase of transistor and chip lifetime by deuterium anneal) and to the reliability of thin oxides in semiconductor technology.

VThe research in my laboratory combines anatomical, behavioral, chemical-ecological, developmental, molecular, and neurophysiological approaches in a multidisciplinary approach to problems of the behavioral roles, functional organization, information-processing mechanisms, and postembryonic development of the olfactory system in insects. The main goal of this work is to discover fundamental principles and mechanisms common to many or all nervous systems through studies of the experimentally favorable nervous systems of insects. At the same time, we seek to understand olfactory mechanisms that underlie beneficial and harmful behaviors of insects that impact human health and welfare. Areas of principal interest currently include processing of olfactory information in intra- and interglomerular neural circuits in the primary olfactory center in the brain; sensory control of insect-host interactions, including feeding, mating, and oviposition behaviors; chemical ecology and behavioral aspects of insect-hostplant interactions; chemosensory influences on host-oriented behavior of disease-vector insects; functional organization of neurosecretory systems; and hybrid insect-MEMS systems.The research in my laboratory combines anatomical, behavioral, chemical-ecological, developmental, molecular, and neurophysiological approaches in a multidisciplinary approach to problems of the behavioral roles, functional organization, information-processing mechanisms, and postembryonic development of the olfactory system in insects.

VAs a mathematician I have been interested in partial differential equations, dynamical systems and symplectic geometry. A central object in symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics is the symplectic diffeomorphism group. Symplectic structures have a very persuasive occurrence in the equations of physics, but also arise in the study of the structure of three-dimensional and four-dimensional spaces. About twenty years ago I introduced a new infinite-dimensional geometry, meanwhile called 'Hofer Geometry', which by now is the standard tool for approaching a broad range of questions in Hamiltonian dynamics and symplectic geometry. Jointly with Y. Eliashberg and V. Givental we developed a theory of symplectic invariants called 'Symplectic Field Theory'. It has relations to string theory, low-dimensional topology, and Hamiltonian dynamics. The details of symplectic field theory are still being worked out, and require the development of new tools in nonlinear analysis, which is being done jointly with K. Wysocki and E.

VI received my Ph.D. doing physical chemistry, spent a postdoctoral year learning some biochemistry, and have wandered between the two poles ever since, with the 'centroid' in Bioinorganic Chemistry. One major component of our work has been the development of electron-nuclear double resonance into a precise and incisive tool for the study of metalloenzyme active sites. Our recent studies of catalytic intermediates that form during the activation of dioxygen by heme enzymes (eg. P450; heme oxygenase) and during the reduction of dinitrogen by nitrogenase have been exceptionally informative. In the latter case, although a complicated kinetic scheme has been in hand for almost thirty years, my collaborators and I have only recently made the first connection between a 'black box' in a kinetic scheme and a characterizable trapped intermediate. A second thread to our research has been the study of inter-protein electron transfer. Here we have come to recognize that the transfer of an electron across a dynamic protein-protein interface almost invariably is controlled not by the ET process itself, but by the dynamics of conformational conversion at the interface.  In the 'background', I've managed to study molecular metals and to collaborate in developing the chemistry of porphyrazine macrocycles for materials and biomedical applications.I received my Ph.D. doing physical chemistry, spent a postdoctoral year learning some biochemistry, and have wandered between the two poles ever since, with the 'centroid' in Bioinorganic Chemistry.

VMy research interests have centered on development and antimicrobial defenses of insects. In the area of development I have studied with my coworkers the biochemistry and functions of the steroid molting hormone ecdysone and have in particular evidenced the transfer of maternal ecdysteroids to the embryo for the control of early developmental processes, such as cuticulogenesis. The major part of my scientific career was devoted to the molecular and cellular anlysis of antimicrobial defenses in grasshoppers and, more recently in the fruitfly Drosophila. With my associates and students we have identified the receptors which recognize bacterial and fungal infections and we have deciphered the intracytoplasmic signaling cascades which lead to the expression of immune responsive genes, many of which encode potent antimicrobial peptides which we have characterized. A highlight of these studies was the discovery of the immune function of the transmembrane receptor Toll, initially known for its role in early embryonic development of the fly. This paved the way to the subsequent discoveries by other groups of mammalian homologues of Toll (the Toll-like receptors), and to the demonstration of their roles as sentinels of innate immunity. Overall, our studies have established Drosophila as the best-known model of innate immunity per se (i.e. in the absence of adaptive immunity), and have strikingly revealed a high degree of conservation of the various players of innate defenses between insects and mammals, pointing to a common ancestry.My research interests have centered on development and antimicrobial defenses of insects.

VThe research in my group combines computational biophysics and bioinformatics with the goal of understanding the structural, physical and chemical basis of a wide range of biological phenomena. Our work includes fundamental theoretical research, the development of software tools, and applications to problems of biological importance. For some time we have been developing methods that allow us to calculate the forces that drive fundamental biological processes. Electrostatic potentials and free energies are obtained from numerical solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation calculated with the DelPhi and GRASP programs developed in our lab. These terms are then integrated into a methodology where other forces are obtained from standard molecular mechanics methods, yielding a complete expression for conformational and binding free energies of almost any system of interest. The methodology is under constant development and refinement, often driven by new applications. Areas of current interest include protein structure prediction and understanding the structural origins of specificity in protein-protein, protein-membrane and protein-DNA interactions. Specific applications of our methods include the study of specificity determinants in cadherins that play a central role in cell-cell interactions, the recognition by transcription factors of different DNA sequences, and the structural origins of protein targeting to specific biological membranes.The research in my group combines computational biophysics and bioinformatics with the goal of understanding the structural, physical and chemical basis of a wide range of biological phenomena.

VI have studied several aspects of lymphocyte development under normal and aberrant conditions. My laboratory has demonstrated that immunoglobulin class switching is mediated by a region-specific recombination, accompanied by looping-out deletion of immunoglobulin constant-region genes from chromosomes. We have also cloned cDNA for IL-4 and IL-5 cytokines that regulate class switching.   More recently we identified a putative RNA-editing enzyme, AID (activation induced cytidine deaminase), which regulates not only class switch recombination but also somatic hypermutation. This unexpected finding suggests that the two apparently different genetic alteration systems in the immunoglobulin gene locus may be regulated by yet another alteration mechanism of genetic information. Another line of studies led us to isolate the PD-1 receptor that delivers negative signaling upon interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. PD-1 deficiency causes autoimmune symptoms such as systemic lupus erythematosus in C57/BL mice and dilated cardiomyopathy in BALB/c mice, indicating that PD-1 plays important roles in immune tolerance. We have identified the suppressor of Hairless gene in Drosophila and its mammalian homologue RBP-J, which has been shown to be the direct signaling target of the Notch receptor and to regulate lineage commitment and differentiation of varieties of cells, including lymphocytes.I have studied several aspects of lymphocyte development under normal and aberrant conditions.

Underlying research areas include large random graphs, high dimensional data, dimension reduction, random walks, learning theory, compressed sensing and clustering. An important area in these activities is the use of random algorithms which with high probability will give the correct answer.

As a faculty member I identified genes that play important roles in the growth, host range, and disease-causing properties of mouse leukemia viruses. Most recently my lab has identified genes essential for early vertebrate development: we first developed a method of insertional mutagenesis for the zebrafish then used it to identify about 25% of the embryonic essential genes of the fish.

VMy group has been studying molecular machines known as chaperonins, which provide kinetic assistance to protein folding in the cell. We originally identified this role when a genetic screen in baker's yeast turned up a mutant unable to fold newly-imported mitochondrial proteins to their native forms. An essential gene was affected, encoding heat shock protein 60, the subunit of a homo-tetradecameric 840 kDa double ring assembly. A closely related assembly present in the bacterial cytoplasm (GroEL), and a second less related class, in archaebacteria (thermosome) and in the eukaryotic cytosol (CCT), were observed to carry out similar actions, all requiring ATP. Structure and mechanism studies carried out with GroEL and its cooperating single ring, lid-like component, GroES, indicate that GroEL first binds non-native proteins in the central cavity of an open ring through hydrophobic contacts formed between such surfaces specifically exposed in non-native proteins and hydrophobic surfaces lining the chaperonin cavity. Polypeptide is then released into an encapsulated and now hydrophilic chamber formed by the binding of ATP and the cochaperonin GroES to the same ring as polypeptide. Folding in this privileged environment ends with ATP hydrolysis, which releases the ligands. Polypeptide molecules that have failed to reach native form become rapidly rebound to an open GroEL ring. Cycles of binding and ATP/GroES-driven folding thus ensure efficiency of this final step in the transfer of information from DNA to active protein.My group has been studying molecular machines known as chaperonins, which provide kinetic assistance to protein folding in the cell.

VMy research aim has been, and continues to be, to develop the fundamental understanding of atmospheric circulation systems on time scales from hours to years, narrowing the gap between what can be described by theory and what occurs in the real atmosphere. Through my contacts with those involved in making predictions, I do my best to make sure that this development of understanding enables improvements in the forecasting of weather and climate variability, and in the confidence of projections of climate change. One broad topic of interest is the structure and growth of middle-latitude cyclones, their organization into storm tracks, and their role in climate variability. I also look for basic mechanisms that lead to, for example, some seasons in the middle latitudes being dominated by anomalous anticyclones or in other seasons the absence of the normal dry anticyclonic summer of the Mediterranean. Many such studies involve consideration of conservative properties and the basic fluid mechanics of processes such as wave-like connections between events occurring on widely spaced regions of the Earth.My research aim has been, and continues to be, to develop the fundamental understanding of atmospheric circulation systems on time scales from hours to years, narrowing the gap between what can be described by theory and what occurs in the real atmosphere.

VTrained as an interdisciplinary social psychologist, I have worked in sociology and social epidemiology to understand the impact of broader social structures and processes on individuals' attitudes, behavior, and well-being, and especially on their health. My and my colleagues' research has helped to demonstrate: first the adverse effects on health of occupational and other forms of stress; then how social relationships and supports can buffer or mitigate these deleterious health effects of stress and promote health more generally; and finally how stress, social relationships and supports, and a broad range of other social, psychological and behavioral factors help us to understand and explain socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in health and the ways health changes over the adult life course. This has contributed to increasing recognition that reducing these social disparities in health is a major goal of public health research and policy and critical to improving overall population health. My current research and writing also seek to improve population health and reduce health disparities by increasing policy-relevant evidence and understanding that population health and health disparities are heavily a function of social, economic, psychological and behavioral factors as well as biomedical ones, and hence of social and economic policies as well as health policies.Trained as an interdisciplinary social psychologist, I have worked in sociology and social epidemiology to understand the impact of broader social structures and processes on individuals' attitudes, behavior, and well-being, and especially on their health.

VMy main interest is social change. I have written on change and variation in social mobility, work life, education, politics, fertility, and religion in the USA as well as social mobility and education in Europe. In that research I have documented the ways in which demographic changes contribute to social change. Demographic changes are important because they explain how society changes even when the individuals that make up society do the same things they always have. The paradox is resolved by noting that the people entering the population through birth and immigration are different from the ones who leave through death or emigration. In this way demographic replacement contributes to social change even when individual people do not change. In doing this work I have also contributed to the technical literature on how to apply statistical methods to social science data. My current projects include a book on major social and cultural trends of the 20th century and research on the social consequences of growing economic inequality in the United States.My main interest is social change.

VA long-term interest has been developing and utilizing techniques that allow forming and transferring patterns at the nanoscale to study and understand electronic and optical behavior that pertains uniquely to nanometer length scales. Strategic integration of heterogeneous materials necessitates control and engineering of interfaces and of bandgaps. These techniques have allowed the observation of electronic conduction in the ballistic regime, and interesting interplays of superconducting and semiconducting transport. More recently, I have focused on structures that confine and modulate light at length scales on the order of a wavelength. Such structures (also called 'cavities' or optical resonators) can provide constraints and capabilities for the optical behavior of the material (semiconductors) beyond its 'natural' optical behavior, so that we can filter and guide light with exceptional precision, alter emission lifetimes, and ultimately, create new, mixed states of light-and-matter. Going beyond semiconductors, "nanophotonic" structures in metals also provide opportunities for novel optical behavior. Finally, in order to find new ways to combine and control heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale, I have begun to explore biotemplating techniques. The structures amenable to biotemplating and their resulting properties will be quite different from those precisely fabricated from precision "top-down" techniques, and one goal is to understand the best integration of the two-different approaches, and what new systems may be formed.A long-term interest has been developing and utilizing techniques that allow forming and transferring patterns at the nanoscale to study and understand electronic and optical behavior that pertains uniquely to nanometer length scales.

VI have been interested in the mechanisms that modulate the communication between neurons in the brain. Neurons communicate with each other at specialized areas, called synapses, where signals are sent and received between neurons. At synapses, active neurons release neurotransmitters that travel across the narrow gap between the neurons and bind to specific receptor molecules on the neighboring neuron. The precise dynamic regulation of the efficiency of synaptic transmission is fundamental for learning, memory, motor control and sensory processing as well as synapse formation and neuronal development. The major research interest of my laboratory has been investigating the molecular mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission in the brain. The approach I have taken has been to study the structure, function and regulation of the neurotransmitter receptors in the nervous system. These receptors mediate synaptic transmission and are a central convergence point for signal transduction at synapses. Modulation of these receptors is a powerful mechanism for the regulation of synaptic transmission. Our studies on these receptors have examined the role of protein phosphorylation in the regulation of their function and the mechanisms underlying the membrane trafficking and synaptic targeting of the receptors. These studies have demonstrated that regulation of receptor function is a major mechanism for the regulation of synaptic transmission in the brain and are an important determinant of animal behavior.I have been interested in the mechanisms that modulate the communication between neurons in the brain.

VI have developed the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) method in the early 1979s, which laid the foundation of the current HRTEM. Nowadays the method is widely used in characterizing local structures of materials, in particular, in exploring structures of nano-crystals, clusters, individual molecules, and atoms, Using HRTEM I have discovered "carbon nanotube" (CNT) in 1991. It has a cylindrical form of up to a few graphene layers with diameter of less than 2-3 nm and length of up to millimeter. Because of its nano-meter sized structure, the carbon nanotube shows unique physical, chemical and mechanical properties different from bulk graphite. Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) become semiconducting dependent on their chirality, so that they can be used to make electronic devices. As-grown SWCNTs are a mixture of semiconducting and metallic tubes but they have been separated applying chemical processes of detergent. Thin films of SWCNTs can be used for thin-film transistors and flexible-transparent-conductive films. Large specific surface areas of SWCNTs are an ideal molecular sieve and adsorbent. These properties are of interest in super-capacitor electrode and drug carriers for drug delivery system. Another use of SWCNTs is a specimen support for HRTEM observation that can provide an ideal noise-less supporter particularly for individual molecules and atoms.I have developed the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) method in the early 1979s, which laid the foundation of the current HRTEM.

VWithin the realms of condensed-matter and statistical physics my specialization areas have been mesoscopic physics and disordered systems. The former is concerned with how the behavior of systems whose size is in-between microscopic and macroscopic, crosses over between these two regimes. My interest in the latter has recently been centered on disordered many-electron systems. Mesoscopic systems can be handled and addressed by usual macroscopic methods, but their behavior may still be dominated by the unusual effects of quantum mechanics. Among the interesting new effects found in mesoscopics, there are: the quantization of various conductances, Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in the conductance of mesoscopic rings and "persistent currents" flowing without dissipation in the normal (non superconducting) resistive state. My research is also concerned with fluctuations and noise. Regarding disordered electronic systems, of great interest to me is the possible spontaneous formation of inhomogeneous granular-type structures in systems with even very small disorder. A similar effect exists, for example, in magnetic systems, which I found earlier, with the late S.-k Ma. In more heavily disordered systems such as electron glasses, I am considering the slow relaxation and conductance phenomena.Within the realms of condensed-matter and statistical physics my specialization areas have been mesoscopic physics and disordered systems.

In more heavily disordered systems such as electron glasses, I am considering the slow relaxation and conductance phenomena.Within the realms of condensed-matter and statistical physics my specialization areas have been mesoscopic physics and disordered systems. The former is concerned with how the behavior of systems whose size is in-between microscopic and macroscopic, crosses over between these two regimes. My interest in the latter has recently been centered on disordered many-electron systems. Mesoscopic systems can be handled and addressed by usual macroscopic methods, but their behavior may still be dominated by the unusual effects of quantum mechanics. Among the interesting new effects found in mesoscopics, there are: the quantization of various conductances, Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in the conductance of mesoscopic rings and "persistent currents" flowing without dissipation in the normal (non superconducting) resistive state. My research is also concerned with fluctuations and noise.

VMy laboratory concentrates on the application of molecular genetics to the development of industrial biocatalysts. New recombinant strains are being constructed to produce liquid fuels such as ethanol and other chemicals from renewable lignocellulosic plant residues. Large-scale production of these chemicals by bio-refineries could reduce world dependence on petroleum, improve the environment, create new domestic industries, and increase employment in many countries. We have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for bulk chemicals by exchanging fermentation pathways between microorganisms. Our initial efforts successfully replaced the native mixed acid fermentation pathways in several Gram-negative bacteria with a yeast-like pathway consisting of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis. The resulting strains produce higher ethanol yields than conventional yeasts and efficiently ferment both hexose and pentose sugars. Further studies have developed biocatalysts that also secrete hydrolases to assist in the depolymerization of carbohydrates such as cellulose. Continuing research efforts are expanding the range of renewable chemicals that can be produced from biomass, increasing the diversity of engineered biocatalysts and decreasing the complexity of future bio-refineries.My laboratory concentrates on the application of molecular genetics to the development of industrial biocatalysts.

VMy research has been devoted to understanding two processes that are critical for disease promoted by many bacterial pathogens: entry and growth within host cells. The main approach of my team has been to develop genetic and biochemical strateigies that allow analysis of the pathogen and its host cells. Investigation of an intestinal pathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, allowed identification of a single protein called invasin that is sufficient to allow entry into host cells. Detailed analyses of this protein by my laboratory resulted in the identification of the biochemical parameters critical for tricking target cell internalization of the pathogen. My laboratory also studies Legionella pneumophila, a bacterium that causes pneumonia by replicating within a membrane-bound compartment in macrophages, cells that normally kill invading microorganisms. Our laboratory has identified a bacterial machine that transfers proteins into host cells and is critical for formation of the replication compartment. The transferred proteins manipulate the movement of membranes and interfere with host cell death pathways. My most recent research efforts are directed toward developing strategies that solve functional redundancy in pathogens. This is a particularly vexing problem in which pathogens use multiple, apparently equally efficient, strategies to perform a single task.My research has been devoted to understanding two processes that are critical for disease promoted by many bacterial pathogens: entry and growth within host cells.

VJacob Israelachvili's research interests are in the general area of intermolecular and inter-surface forces in complex fluid systems. He uses the Surface Forces Apparatus for directly measuring the forces between surfaces in liquids and vapors, and for studying other interfacial phenomena, providing information at the molecular level not always available by other techniques. His current research is primarily experimental, and involves measurements of the interactions between various surfaces separated by various liquids and liquid mixtures, surfactants and polymers, and the interactions of biomembranes and biological macromolecules. Not only static (i.e., equilibrium) but also dynamic forces are being looked at, such as the micro-viscosity of thin films, molecular relaxation processes at surfaces, friction and lubrication, cavitation and wear. In particular, Professor Israelachvili is currently studying the very short-range (e.g., adhesion) forces between surfaces in controlled vapors and liquids, and the relation between adhesion, friction, and the conformations of molecules trapped between surfaces.   Another area of activity is the development of new experimental techniques, especially for studying dynamic and time-dependent interactions, the frictional forces between moving (e.g., shearing) surfaces, the rheology of thin films, and any resulting surface deformations (including damage and wear). New attachments are also being developed for measuring very weak forces that take a long time to equilibrate, high speed and very fast processes (including transient effects), and opto-electronic and chemical processes at interfaces and thin surface films. New techniques for using different surface materials such as polymers, silica, metal oxide layers, etc., are also in progress.  The aim of these studies is to gain insight into the fundamental interactions in complex colloidal, material and biological systems that also have technological applications, for example, in developing new types of soft structured (bio)materials, adaptable materials, and new complex fluid (e.g., lubricant) systems.Jacob Israelachvili's research interests are in the general area of intermolecular and inter-surface forces in complex fluid systems.

VIn the brain, numerous neurons form an elaborate circuit that displays subtle functions. How this can happen has been the central theme of my research throughout the past 50 years. Since we discovered the exclusively inhibitory action of Purkinje cells in 1964, the sole output neurons of the cerebellum, the cerebellum has been the main area of my work. In the 1979's, we analyzed the mechanism of adaptive control of the vestibulo-ocular reflex by Purkinje cells. This was followed by the discovery of long-term depression LTD as the major cellular mechanism of adaptation, in 1982. Since then, I have been engaged in investigation of cellular and molecular mechanisms of LTD, using cerebellar slices or cultured Purkinje cells. Major targets have been protein kinase G and its substrate, protein phosphatase 2A, cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha and other proteins. In recent years, it has been hypothesized that the cerebellum helps the control of movements by providing an internal model of a motor apparatus. This view receives strong support from computational modeling and experimental neuroscience. My thought is centered on a further concept that the cerebellum controls also certain mental activities, typically the thought, based on a similar mechanism.In the brain, numerous neurons form an elaborate circuit that displays subtle functions.

The main areas of analytic number theory in my works concern exponential and character sums, distribution of prime numbers, sieve methods. The theory of automorphic forms offers powerful tools for solving problems in analytic number theory. In particular my results deal with estimates for the Fourier coefficients of cusp forms. Applications of automorphic L-functions (subconvexity bounds) to questions of equidistribution of various arithmetical sequences occupy much of my recent research work.I am primarily interested in analytic number theory and automorphic forms.

VMy research is focused on the genetic events that drive tumor development. Using a combination of cell-based and whole animal studies, my group has investigated the functions of a number of genes that are frequently altered in the development of human cancers. The p53 tumor suppressor gene and the K-ras oncogene, which are mutated in approximately 50% and 30% of all human tumors, are the two genes that we have studied most extensively. A central theme of our research has been to study the effects of mutations in cancer-associated genes in context by creating genetically-engineered mouse strains in which we have altered the mouse homolog of the gene in the germline. Using a combination of constitutive and conditional mutations and by creating a large series of compound mutant strains, we have succeeded in developing accurate models of cancers of the lung, ovary, pancreas and other sites. These models are useful for studying aspects of disease biology as well as for testing new methods of therapy, early detection and prevention of cancer.My research is focused on the genetic events that drive tumor development.

VI was fortunate to have studied cytogenetics as an undergraduate and this led to my being employed in research in the new field of human cytogenetics. My research has remained focused in this field for over 50 years. The correct number of human chromosomes was first described in 1956 and in 1959 it was shown that additional or missing chromosomes, present in every cell in the body were compatible with life and the cause of a number of clinical syndromes. In 1959 I reported the first human chromosome abnormality, namely the 47,XXY constitution associated with Klinefelter's syndrome, thus demonstrating that (i) the syndrome was the result of an additional X chromosome in males and (ii) the Y chromosome was male determining in mammals. My subsequent research has ranged widely over the whole field of human cytogenetics but has had 3 main foci: 1) the frequency, mechanism of origin and epidemiology of congenital numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities, 2) the phenotype associated with congenital chromosome abnormalities with particular reference to those associated with fetal loss, and 3) studies of the Fragile X syndrome, an X-linked disease causing mental retardation and the first disease shown to be the result of a novel mutational mechanism, namely trinucleotide repeat expansion. This type of mutation is now known to be associated with over 20 neurological diseases in man.I was fortunate to have studied cytogenetics as an undergraduate and this led to my being employed in research in the new field of human cytogenetics.

VMy research program is directed toward the discovery of fundamentally and practically important catalytic reactions, and the definition of new reactivity principles. Through the discovery and development of chiral Schiff base complexes of main group and transition metals and of novel organic catalysts, my group has uncovered effective methods for a wide variety of enantioselective catalytic oxidation, hydrolytic, and carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. These discoveries have led to the first practical catalysts for asymmetric epoxidation of unfunctionalized olefins, hydrolytic kinetic resolution of epoxides, hetero-Diels-Alder reactions, Strecker reactions, and Pictet-Spengler reactions. We apply detailed mechanistic studies of these processes, and have uncovered important general principles that have been adopted widely in the field of organic chemistry. These include the concepts of electronic tuning of enantioselectivity, privileged chiral catalysts, cooperative bimetallic catalysis, and small-molecule H-bonding catalysts. The methods developed by my group have been applied to crucially important targets by academic and industrial chemists throughout the world and have had a major impact on how organic synthesis is done. The (salen)Mn-catalyzed epoxidation reaction was implemented by Merck and applied in the commercial synthesis of the HIV protease inhibitor Crixivan (registered). The hydrolytic kinetic resolution reaction is applied on multi-metric ton scale to the preparation of several chiral epoxides, including propylene oxide and epichlorohydrin.My research program is directed toward the discovery of fundamentally and practically important catalytic reactions, and the definition of new reactivity principles.

VI have always been fascinated by the rich interplay between the frontiers of mathematics and those of physics; these ideas have come to span almost every subfield in the two subjects. Sixty years ago, quantized field equations appeared a natural way to incorporate relativity into a quantum description of nature. This approach led to famous experimental checks, despite questionable renormalization calculations used to avoid divergences. Constructive quantum field theory (CQFT) eventually became the mathematical domain to ask whether quantum fields and the physical principles of renormalization have a logical foundation. My early work focused on establishing CQFT in space-times of two and three dimensions. This problem remains unresolved for the four-dimensional Yang-Mills equations: During the year 2000 understanding these equations was named one of seven mathematical millennium prize problems. I became intrigued with the invention of non-commutative geometry (NCG) in the 1980s, for that new mathematical structure allows one to incorporate quantization into the definition of space. Meanwhile, in physics, super-symmetry describes a relation between Bose particles and Fermi particles. My recent study of supersymmetric quantum fields led to new tools and examples for NCG and for CQFT.I have always been fascinated by the rich interplay between the frontiers of mathematics and those of physics; these ideas have come to span almost every subfield in the two subjects.

VMy research goals are to understand the nature of barriers to the delivery and efficacy of molecular and nano-medicine in tumors, to develop and test new principles to overcome these barriers for improving detection and treatment of tumors, and to translate these principles from bench to bedside and in the process discover new biomarkers and new strategies to improve the outcome further. This seamless integration between bench and bedside is a hallmark of my research. To unravel the complex pathophysiology of tumors, we have developed an array of cutting-edge and innovative technologies and sophisticated animal and mathematical models. These tools have enabled us to reveal how the vascular and extravascular compartments in solid tumors actually function and malfunction, and how their pathological behavior thwarts the effectiveness of therapeutics. In 2001, I proposed a novel principle that antiangiogenic therapy can "normalize" the abnormal tumor vasculature and improve both the delivery and efficacy of therapeutics. We then provided compelling evidence in support of this hypothesis in animal models and cancer patients and uncovered some of the complex molecular mechanisms responsible for vascular normalization. Most recently, we have discovered that the extent of vascular normalization can be used as a predictive biomarker in these patients.My research goals are to understand the nature of barriers to the delivery and efficacy of molecular and nano-medicine in tumors, to develop and test new principles to overcome these barriers for improving detection and treatment of tumors, and to translate these principles from bench to bedside and in the process discover new biomarkers and new strategies to improve the outcome further.

We focus on the mosquitoes that vector human malaria parasites and dengue viruses. These efforts include the identification and isolation of mosquito genes whose control sequences can be used to direct the expression of antipathogen effector molecules.

VMy research focuses on the properties of materials at the high pressures and temperatures existing deep inside planets, the objective being to characterize the processes by which planets evolve over geological time periods. Most of my research is experimental, using both static (diamond-anvil cell) and dynamic (shock-wave) methods, and is intended to document the phases (e. g., crystal structures) produced at high pressures, and the elastic, thermal and electronic properties of these phases. The high-pressure measurements have also been used to successfully test and improve theoretical predictions of material properties based on first-principles (quantum mechanical) calculations. Elements and compounds typically exhibit dramatic changes in chemical-bonding upon compression to the ~ million atmosphere pressures achieved within planets (e. g., electrically insulating salts becoming metallic); the material properties of deep planetary interiors thus differ significantly from the properties of those same materials at Earth-surface conditions. Recent work combines shock-wave and static techniques in order to extend experiments from the million-atmosphere to the billion-atmosphere range of pressures: high enough to reproduce conditions inside super-giant planets and brown dwarfs, and to explore an entirely new regime of chemical bonding ("kilovolt chemistry").My research focuses on the properties of materials at the high pressures and temperatures existing deep inside planets, the objective being to characterize the processes by which planets evolve over geological time periods.

VMy research has focused on molecular mechanisms that control the assembly of neuronal connections during the development of the vertebrate central nervous system, using circuits that subserve sensory-motor function in the spinal cord as a model system. A combination of cellular and genetic assays has shown how spinal cord progenitor cells acquire their early positional identity and how they respond to inductive signals with the generation of specific neuronal subtypes. These studies have revealed that some secreted inductive factors, notably Sonic Hedgehog, function as gradient morphogens, imposing precise spatial patterns of expression of transcription factors that determine motor neuron and interneuron identity. In addition, my work has shown that hierarchical sets of transcription factors expressed by subsets of post-mitotic neurons orchestrate two of the later steps in circuit assembly (axonal guidance and synaptic connectivity) by regulating the expression of downstream genes that encode neuronal surface receptors and adhesion proteins.My research has focused on molecular mechanisms that control the assembly of neuronal connections during the development of the vertebrate central nervous system, using circuits that subserve sensory-motor function in the spinal cord as a model system.

VProf. Joannopoulos' research efforts have been in theoretical condensed matter physics, and he is responsible for the development of numerous theoretical methods to enable tractable and accurate calculations of elementary excitations in complex many-particle systems. In particular, his interests have spanned a wide range of topics including the electronic, vibrational, and optical structure of crystalline and amorphous bulk solids, their surfaces, interfaces, and defects; localization in disordered systems; phase transitions and critical phenomena; and, over the past two decades, the theory of lightwave phenomena in photonic crystals. Photonic crystals are periodic dielectric structures that have a band gap that forbids propagation of a certain frequency range of light. This and other properties of these systems enable one to control light with amazing facility and produce effects that are impossible with conventional materials, including reverse Doppler shifts, anomalous Cerenkov radiation, negative refraction and subwavelength imaging, bandwidth-narrowing without losses, magnetic-dipole radiation from non-magnetic photonic crystals, and one-way lightwave-guiding with complete immunity to disorder and obstacles.Prof. Joannopoulos' research efforts have been in theoretical condensed matter physics, and he is responsible for the development of numerous theoretical methods to enable tractable and accurate calculations of elementary excitations in complex many-particle systems.

VProfessor Johnson does research on non-equilibrium and metastable materials including undercooled liquids, metallic glasses, and non-equilibrium crystals. His early work involved characterizing the thermodynamic stability of crystals with respect to melting and solid state "crystal to glass" transformations (see W.L. Johnson, Prog. in Mat. Sci., 1986). In the early 1990's, his group developed novel families of metallic alloys which form bulk metallic glasses, or BMG's (Peker and Johnson, Appl. Phys. Lett., 1993) Later work on these glass forming liquids has covered studies thermodynamics, rheology and flow, relaxation dynamics, and the glass transition in metallic glasses (e.g. see W.L. Johnson, Mat. Res. Soc. Bull., 1999).  Over the past decade, his group has investigated the thermal, physical, and mechanical properties of solid metallic glasses (for example, Johnson and Samwer, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2005) and metallic glass matrix composites. The research on metallic glasses has focused on deformation, plastic flow, shear banding, and fracture of glasses. Work on glassy matrix composites has led to development of "structural amorphous metals" with exceptional combinations of strength, ductility, and toughness (e.g. Hays, Kim, and Johnson, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2000). Prof. Johnson has been actively involved in technology transfer and engineering applications of metallic glasses.

VMy research concerns high-level cognitive processes, such as thinking and reasoning, which I study using both computational modeling and psychological experiments. The theory of thinking that I have developed postulates that it depends on the construction of mental models of possibilities. Inferences that call for only a single model of a possibility are reliably easier than those that call for models of multiple possibilities. Models tend to represent what is true, and, as a consequence, even the best reasoners succumb to systematic fallacies when falsity is at stake. Recent studies with my colleagues have applied this theory to reverse engineering, to the detection and explanation of inconsistencies, to the acquisition of concepts, and to causal reasoning. Other recent research derives from a theory of emotions developed in collaboration with Keith Oatley. With psychiatric colleagues (Francesco Mancini and Amelia Gangemi), I have proposed a theory of psychological illnesses, such as phobias, depression, and obsessive compulsive disorder: they owe their origin to hyper emotional reactions rather than to faulty thinking. In studies corroborating this theory, we have discovered that individuals suffering from various neuroses reason better than control participants but only about matters pertaining to their illnesses.My research concerns high-level cognitive processes, such as thinking and reasoning, which I study using both computational modeling and psychological experiments.

VMy interests encompass the rarefied plasmas of interplanetary and interstellar space, including the energetic charged particles (commonly called cosmic rays) that permeate these plasmas. The plasmas are generally turbulent and generate strong collisionless shock waves, features that are involved in the physical processes leading to acceleration and spatial transport of cosmic rays. Not only are these particles interesting in their own right but they also provide unique information concerning the regions where they originate and through which they pass before being observed. My work has involved all of these aspects of cosmic rays and astrophysical plasmas.  Observations from interplanetary spacecraft have provided the stimulation and most stringent tests for my work on cosmic rays. My colleagues and I have been successful in both providing explanations of observed phenomena and making successful predictions of what would be seen in regions not yet explored. We predicted the existence of large-amplitude Alfven waves in the high-latitude solar wind before Ulysses observed them in the first ever traverse of the polar heliosphere. In addition, our suggestion that the anomalous cosmic rays are accelerated at the termination of the solar wind appears to be correct.My interests encompass the rarefied plasmas of interplanetary and interstellar space, including the energetic charged particles (commonly called cosmic rays) that permeate these plasmas. The plasmas are generally turbulent and generate strong collisionless shock waves, features that are involved in the physical processes leading to acceleration and spatial transport of cosmic rays. Not only are these particles interesting in their own right but they also provide unique information concerning the regions where they originate and through which they pass before being observed. My work has involved all of these aspects of cosmic rays and astrophysical plasmas.  Observations from interplanetary spacecraft have provided the stimulation and most stringent tests for my work on cosmic rays. My colleagues and I have been successful in both providing explanations of observed phenomena and making successful predictions of what would be seen in regions not yet explored.

VAs a Breeder, I am interested in crop breeding, genetics and molecular biology and have successfully developed a new variety of rice called the New Rice for Africa (NERICA). This is based on the introgression of traits of the traditional robust African rice varieties (O.glaberrima) with the productive Asian varieties (O. sativa). This true interspecific hybrid has important morpho-agronomic traits for weed suppression and higher levels of resistance/tolerance to major biotic and abiotic stresses. NERICA also gives higher yield and taste good, characteristics uniquely suited to poor African rice farmers. I am currently the Executive Secretary of the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa, where I coordinate continent-wide research in both the biophysical and social sciences in collaboration with a range of stakeholders involved in agricultural research for development in Africa. I am also interested in food security and rural development. The Sub-Saharan Africa Challenge Programme which I manage at FARA aims to substantially increase the impact of agricultural research on livelihoods of smallholder farmers in sub Saharan Africa by transforming the way sectors and institutions engage in research. The transformation entails testing and catalyzing wide scale use of innovation systems approaches to agricultural research for development in Sub-Saharan Africa.As a Breeder, I am interested in crop breeding, genetics and molecular biology and have successfully developed a new variety of rice called the New Rice for Africa (NERICA).

VIn pure mathematics my research has concentrated on function spaces and geometric measure theory. I did much of my early work on bounded analytic functions in planar domains and the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation (BMO) on Euclidean space. I found a constructive method of producing bounded solutions to the d-bar problem when the data was a Carleson measure, and this later led to my proof with John Garnett of the corona problem for Denjoy domains. I also worked on various problems concerning Sobolev spaces, including a proof that locally uniform domains are extension domains for all classical Sobolev spaces. My work in potential theory includes a theorem proven with Tom Wolf: On every planar domain, the harmonic measure is supported on a set of Hausdorff dimension at most one. This extended a result due to N.G. Makarov for the simply connected case. My work in geometric measure theory has centered on results in quantitative rectifiability. I proved that in the plane one can give a geometric multi-scale condition for solving the analyst's traveling salesman problem: When is a set contained in a curve (connected set) of finite length? One half of that proof works in any dimension; the other half was later proven in all dimensions by Kate Okikiolu. With Chris Bishop I proved several results on Hausdorff dimension of limit sets of Kleinian groups. Recently I have been working on problems related to diffusion geometry, a method used for discovery in data sets. With Mauro Maggioni and Raanan Schul I have shown that on Riemannian manifolds with minimal smoothness, one can use eigenfunctions to efficiently put coordinate systems on embedded balls.In pure mathematics my research has concentrated on function spaces and geometric measure theory.

VMy research has been concentrated on the theory of international trade. Part of this research deals with the competitive models of trade and the interactions between a country's factor endowments and output and trade patterns on the one hand and the prices of traded commodities and a country's internal distribution of income on the other. Although explicit compositional results in higher-dimensional cases is not to be expected, my research has developed a series of smaller-scale competitive models that yield insights into the role that factor-intensity rankings and factor-substitution characteristics play in answering questions about trade patterns and income distribution.  Much of my work, both past and future, is devoted to the importance of the international mobility of factors of production, such as labor and capital, as well as trade in intermediate products and goods-in-process. In particular I am concerned with the ongoing trend in which production processes become fragmented worldwide, with many countries involved in stages of the production of particular items such as automobiles, cameras, and pharmaceuticals.My research has been concentrated on the theory of international trade.

VI am a pharmacologist with a specific interest in the discovery, the mechanism of action and development of antiestrogenic medicines to treat and prevent breast cancer. ICI46474 (tamoxifen) was unsuccessfully developed as a postcoital contraceptive. However my laboratory subsequently created the scientific principles for targeting the tumor estrogen receptor with long-term adjuvant therapy that enhanced patient survivorship. Similarly, my laboratory completed the first experiments to create a foundation for tamoxifen's use as a preventive for breast cancer in high risk women. I found that the related compound now called raloxifene preserved bone density in estrogen deprived animals, but prevented mammary cancer at the same time. Unlike tamoxifen, that caused the growth of endometrial cancer in our laboratory models, raloxifene did not. Today raloxifene is used to prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer, without increasing the risk of endometrial cancer. These data formed the basis of our description of the new drug group Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMS). For two decades, my laboratory has documented the evolution and mechanisms of antihormone drug resistance in breast cancer, and recently described the mechanism for the paradoxical observation that estrogen can cause apoptosis in appropriately vulnerable breast cancers.I am a pharmacologist with a specific interest in the discovery, the mechanism of action and development of antiestrogenic medicines to treat and prevent breast cancer.

VMy research concerns the biochemistry of RNA and the development of novel RNA and DNA enzymes through in vitro evolution. Like their protein counterparts, nucleic acid enzymes assume a well-defined structure that is responsible for their catalytic activity. Unlike proteins, nucleic acids are genetic molecules that can be amplified and mutated in the test tube. My laboratory has learned to exploit the dual role of nucleic acids as both catalyst and genetic molecule to develop RNA- and DNA-based evolving systems that operate entirely in vitro. We can carry out up to 100 "generations" of test-tube evolution daily, allowing us to evolve nucleic acid enzymes at a much more rapid pace than in nature. Our studies of RNA-based evolution are relevant to understanding the early history of life on Earth. It is believed that an RNA-based genetic system (the "RNA world") preceded the DNA and protein-based genetic system that has existed for 3.5 billion years. Our research aims to recapitulate the biochemistry of the RNA world in the laboratory. We use in vitro evolution to explore the catalytic potential of RNA, especially to search for RNA enzymes that have the ability to catalyze their own replication.My research concerns the biochemistry of RNA and the development of novel RNA and DNA enzymes through in vitro evolution.

VMy group is interested in understanding how signals are received and transmitted by the nervous system.  In one aspect of our research, we have exploited the power of natural products to elucidate molecular mechanisms of pain sensation.  For example, we have asked how capsaicin, the main pungent ingredient in "hot" chili peppers, elicits burning pain, and how menthol, the cooling agent in mint leaves, evokes an icy cool sensation.  Using these agents as pharmacological probes, we have identified ion channels on sensory nerve fibers that are activated by heat or cold, providing molecular insight into the process of thermosensation.  With the aid of genetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral methods, we are asking how these ion channels contribute to the detection of heat or cold, and how their activity is modulated in response to tumor growth, infection, or other forms of injury that produce inflammation and pain hypersensitivity.  In addition to our work on somatosensation and pain, we also study the structure and function of specific neurotransmitter receptors, such as those activated by serotonin or extracellular nucleotides, and use genetic methods to identify roles for these receptors in physiological and behavioral processes, such as feeding, anxiety, pain, thrombosis, and cell growth and motility.My group is interested in understanding how signals are received and transmitted by the nervous system.

VMy research has been directed toward several broad goals. First, my co-workers and I have used electrophysiological, anatomical, and histochemical procedures to investigate how sensory and motor systems are organized in the brains of various mammals, especially primates. As part of this effort, comparisons across species have led to theories of how complex systems evolved from simpler systems. Second, our increased understanding of how sensory and motor systems are organized in normal primates has allowed us to determine how these systems reorganize and respond to sensory loss and damage, even in mature animals. Thus, much of my current research is directed toward determining how developing and mature systems change with alterations in sensory inputs, and determining the mechanisms of change. I hope to learn how to promote plastic changes that are beneficial and help recoveries from brain damage, and prevent those changes that are detrimental. Third, our increased understanding of the complexity of sensory and motor systems has led to questions about how these systems function during behavior. We are starting to record from neurons in several parts of these systems with arrays of chronically implanted microelectrodes in efforts to determine how populations of neurons mediate behavior.My research has been directed toward several broad goals.

VIn recent years I have done theoretical and empirical research on intuitive judgment, decision-making, various aspects of behavioral economics, applications of psychology to the study of legal institutions, and most intensively in the study of hedonic experience and well-being. Much of my earlier work was concerned with the characterization of the ways that human judgments and choices depart from the standard models of the rational agent, and with an attempt to understand the processes--notably the asymmetry in the treatment of gains and losses--that account for performance in these domains. More recently my focus has been on studies of "experienced utility," including the contrast between actual hedonic experience and what people remember of it. Extending these ideas to the field of well-being, I am now studying the distinction between affective experience and life satisfaction, hoping to understand the puzzles of adaptation to life circumstances and also to produce improved measures of quality of life that might be used for policy evaluation.In recent years I have done theoretical and empirical research on intuitive judgment, decision-making, various aspects of behavioral economics, applications of psychology to the study of legal institutions, and most intensively in the study of hedonic experience and well-being.

Much of my earlier work was concerned with the characterization of the ways that human judgments and choices depart from the standard models of the rational agent, and with an attempt to understand the processes--notably the asymmetry in the treatment of gains and losses--that account for performance in these domains.

VMuch of the research I have performed has been carried out with some 100 doctoral and postdoctoral scholars over the last four decades and has ranged over many areas of electrical engineering (information and communication theory, statistical signal detection and estimation, linear system theory, control theory, inverse scattering, sensor array processing, VLSI design, and computation) and mathematics (stochastic processes, operator theory, linear algebra, and interpolation theory). I have particularly enjoyed working at the interfaces of these fields, carrying tools and insights across various disciplinary boundaries. My current major interests are in the area of semiconductor manufacturing and in developing fast algorithms for many applications by identifying and exploiting we have called "displacement structure" in the problem. In the first area I have introduced multi-variable system identification and control techniques to generate (essentially) arbitrary temperature profiles across a wafer, a possibility that can significantly increase the yield of thermal processing operations in many fields. So also in optical lithography, concepts of signal processing have been successfully introduced to break the "0.1 um barrier" in optical lithography.Much of the research I have performed has been carried out with some 100 doctoral and postdoctoral scholars over the last four decades and has ranged over many areas of electrical engineering (information and communication theory, statistical signal detection and estimation, linear system theory, control theory, inverse scattering, sensor array processing, VLSI design, and computation) and mathematics (stochastic processes, operator theory, linear algebra, and interpolation theory).

VAs a microbial oceanographer, I have studied the distribution and metabolic activities of microorganisms at various sites in the global ocean from the equator to both poles and from the surface to the greatest ocean depths. Because I am interested in the ecology of microorganisms, including their response to climate variability, most of my research is conducted aboard vessels at sea. To date I have participated in more than fifty expeditions including more than twenty to Antarctica. Research in my laboratory has centered around the ocean's carbon cycle from photosynthetic production of organic matter to carbon sequestration in the deep sea. In 1988 we established an open ocean time-series station in the subtropical North Pacific as a sentinel for observing the effects of climate on the structure and function of microbial communities. This ongoing ecological research has already documented significant subdecadal scale changes in microbial ecology that can be tied to large scale climate variations such as El Nino and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We have recently established a new Center for Microbial Oceanography that will broaden these efforts to include metagenomics and ecosystem modeling and prediction.As a microbial oceanographer, I have studied the distribution and metabolic activities of microorganisms at various sites in the global ocean from the equator to both poles and from the surface to the greatest ocean depths.

VOver the years, my research has focused on four interrelated areas: social issues in risk analysis and management, high-risk regions and places to global environmental change, and public participation and democratic processes. In regard to risk analysis and management, with other colleagues at Clark University we formulated basic conceptual notions and methods for risk analysis, including the causal structure of risk, taxonomy of technological risk, and management structures and processes. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, we examined in a series of studies the interaction between risk and ethics, with particular attention to risk allocations and tradeoffs between the current and future generations, between places and social groups, and between publics and workers. This included an integrated framework for equity analysis.   Collaborating with researchers at Decision Research, Inc., we subsequently created an analytical approach for examining how societies process technological and environmental risks, termed the "social amplification of risk." The second stream of research has focused particularly on integrated analyses of highly vulnerable groups and places to global environmental change, resulting in a series of books on high-risk regions, entitled Regions at Risk. A conceptual framework for vulnerability assessment identifies how an analysis integrating ecological and social issues may be undertaken and the framework has been applied to a number of cases. Finally, continuing studies have examined how public participation and risk communication may best be designed and evaluated, according to underlying principles of democratic procedure and treating social trust in particular depth.Over the years, my research has focused on four interrelated areas: social issues in risk analysis and management, high-risk regions and places to global environmental change, and public participation and democratic processes.

VMy early research was on the electronic and optical properties of amorphous semiconductors, especially chalcogenide glasses. Although the atoms in these materials are not arrayed on a crystal lattice, they are still useful for electronic and optical memories. Together with David Adler and Hellmut Fritzshe, I invented a model that relates the electronic properties of these materials to their chemical bonding. For a number of years I studied the physics of high temperature superconductors, in collaboration with Robert Birgeneau, particularly the relationship of their unusual magnetic properties to their electron transport. In 1990 my group fabricated the first semiconductor single-electron transistor, a transistor that turns on and off again every time one electron is added to it. My group used these nano-electronic devices as tools to study the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons confined to nanometer dimensions. In particular, in 1998 we discovered the Kondo effect, a state in which electrons inside and outside the transistor are quantum mechanically entangled with each other. We were able to study the Kondo effect out of equilibrium, which was not possible in other Kondo systems. Most recently we have been studying one of the most unusual of the quantum Hall states, that for which the filling fraction is 5/2. Using tunneling in nano-structures we have been able to measure the fractional charge and coupling constant for the quasiparticles in this state.My early research was on the electronic and optical properties of amorphous semiconductors, especially chalcogenide glasses.

VGiven a polynomial equation with integer ("whole number") coefficients in several variables, e.g., say f(X, Y) := Y^2 + X^3 - X + 1 = 0, we want to understand its "solutions", in all possible senses of that word. The fundamental problem in number theory is to understand solutions in integers, but quite often we cannot attack this problem directly. Instead, for each prime number p, we study solutions "mod p", meaning that we look for integers n and m such that the integer f(n, m) is divisible by p (instead of being 0, which is what we require for an integer solution). This study can sometimes show that an equation has no integer solutions, since any integer solution is a mod p solution for every p. For instance, the equation above has no mod 3 solutions, and hence it has no integer solutions. Given an equation f, we count the number of its mod p solutions when n and m are both between 0 and p-1: call this number N(p,f). The basic theme of my research is to understand how N(p,f) varies when we vary f, but fix p, or when we fix f but vary p. For instance, if we take a second equation g, we can look at N(p,f) - N(p,g), and ask several questions about it: 1) Archimedean question: how big is this difference? 2) p-adic question: what is the biggest power of p that divides this difference? 3) l-adic question: for each prime number l other than p, what is the biggest power of l that divides this difference? Or we can vary g, and ask about the statistics of the answers we get to each of these questions about N(p,f) - N(p,g).  Answering such questions involves apparently unrelated areas of mathematics, such as random matrix theory, representation theory, and theory of linear differential equations and their monodromy groups.Given a polynomial equation with integer ("whole number") coefficients in several variables, e.g., say f(X, Y) := Y^2 + X^3 - X + 1 = 0, we want to understand its "solutions", in all possible senses of that word.

VThe goal of my laboratory is to contribute to an understanding of the genetic regulation development of higher organisms. The homeotic (Hox) genes of Drosophila melanogaster have been our principal focus. Homeotic lesions cause one portion of the animal to be transformed into an identity normally found elsewhere. The role of the Hox genes is best viewed as a set of developmental switches for decisions of segmental fate. The encoded homeodomain has shown that this switch activity is carried out through the transcriptional regulation of target genes. By using the knowledge we have gained from Drosophila, we are now able to examine the evolution of segmental diversity within the arthropods. Since Hox genes play a pivotal role in segmental identity, it is thought that they are responsible, in part, for arthropod diversity. We therefore have extended our analysis of Hox genes and cloned Hox genes from several insects and representative species from the Crustacea, Chelicerata and Myriapoda. Hox gene expression patterns in these arthropods offer tantalizing clues to developmental processes in this very diverse group of organisms. We have also taken a functional approach to studying Hox gene evolution using the technique of RNA-mediated gene inhibition (RNAi). These approaches have allowed us to study both the development of this very diverse group of organisms, and to understand how this process evolves.The goal of my laboratory is to contribute to an understanding of the genetic regulation development of higher organisms.

VMy laboratory has used genetic and physiologic techniques to define mechanisms underlying life-threatening cardiovascular disease, particularly cardiac arrhythmias and obstructive vascular disease. We discovered the first arrhythmia genes and demonstrated that these genes encode the ion channels that regulate cardiac excitability. We now know that arrhythmias result from inherited or acquired dysfunction of these channels. We also discovered that recurrent injury and inadequate regeneration of the elastin extracellular matrix cause obstructive vascular disease. Our work provides new insight into disease pathogenesis, tests for identifying individuals with genetic risk before the disease becomes apparent, safer pharmaceutical development by reducing risk of drug-induced arrhythmias, and the potential for new therapies. Our pathophysiologic studies show that inadequate regeneration and scarring are common mechanisms of disease. My laboratory's current research is focused on regeneration. We recently discovered that zebrafish regenerate functional heart muscle 60 days following injury. Using rodents, which have limited regenerative capabilities, and zebrafish, organisms with remarkable regenerative capacity, we are defining the cellular and molecular events responsible for regeneration.My laboratory has used genetic and physiologic techniques to define mechanisms underlying life-threatening cardiovascular disease, particularly cardiac arrhythmias and obstructive vascular disease.

We now know that arrhythmias result from inherited or acquired dysfunction of these channels. We also discovered that recurrent injury and inadequate regeneration of the elastin extracellular matrix cause obstructive vascular disease. Our work provides new insight into disease pathogenesis, tests for identifying individuals with genetic risk before the disease becomes apparent, safer pharmaceutical development by reducing risk of drug-induced arrhythmias, and the potential for new therapies. Our pathophysiologic studies show that inadequate regeneration and scarring are common mechanisms of disease. My laboratory's current research is focused on regeneration. We recently discovered that zebrafish regenerate functional heart muscle 60 days following injury.

VThe social, economic and political organization of premodern unstratified societies (lacking centralized, hierarchical institional forms) has been the principal focus of my Anthropological research. The theoretical issues I have addressed in publications include: 1) the locus for the production of inequality in such societies, 2) the interrelationship between human nature, war and the constitution of society, 3) the distinctive features of peaceful societies, 4) the origin of war, 5) the prehistoric evolution of lethal intergroup violence, 6) the coevolution of war and society, 7) the causes and means of territorial expansion, 8) the constitution of socioecological systems of relations in which material causality operates and the selective cultural canalization of material forces, 9) the formal properties of expansionist (colonizing) systems, 10) the constitutive relational properties of structures, 11) the relation between structural constitution and event (or practice), and 12) the process of structural transformation.The social, economic and political organization of premodern unstratified societies (lacking centralized, hierarchical institional forms) has been the principal focus of my Anthropological research.

VAs a marine geologist and paleoceanographer I have aimed my research at unraveling the evolution of the global environment and biota during the Cenozoic Era (the last 65 million years) and processes that caused this change. Using Antarctica as a focus, colleagues and I have demonstrated close coupling between changes in the lithosphere (plate tectonics), ocean (paleoceanography), atmosphere (climate), cryosphere (ice sheets), and biosphere (marine and terrestrial life). I conceived the hypothesis that the development and expansion of the Circum-Antarctic Current during the Cenozoic thermally isolated the Antarctic Continent and caused formation of its ice sheets and cooling of the deep ocean. This demonstrated the importance of the opening and closing of oceanic gateways in directing environmental evolution of the planet. My work, with colleagues, has led to the discovery of major climatic and oceanographic changes associated with several epoch boundaries, thus explaining their placement within the geologic timescale. This helped tie global stratigraphy with modern paleoceanography, explaining the basis of classical stratigraphy itself. My more recent work is involved with the documentation and understanding of the cause of very rapid climatic changes during our present ice age (Quaternary), with emphasis on extraordinary marine sedimentary records of the California margin.As a marine geologist and paleoceanographer I have aimed my research at unraveling the evolution of the global environment and biota during the Cenozoic Era (the last 65 million years) and processes that caused this change.

VMy research is focused on observational extragalactic astronomy and cosmology. One of my main interests is to use observations of the stellar contents and chemical compositions of galaxies to trace their evolution, and to understand the underlying physical processes that drive this evolution. This research has produced some of the most widely used methods for measuring the rates of star formation in galaxies, and quantified the changes in star formation rates and histories along the Hubble sequence of galaxy types. These changes in star formation activity now appear to be driven almost entirely by underlying variations in the density of interstellar gas, following a well-defined scaling law, coupled with a star formation threshold at low density. The gas distributions in turn are regulated by a combination of internal (secular) evolutionary processes along with externally triggered events such as tidal interactions and galactic mergers, which influence the flow of gas both within galaxies and between the galaxies and their surroundings. My other main research area is in observational cosmology, including the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale and Hubble constant using the Hubble Space Telescope. Our team's result has contributed to the current "concordance" cosmology of an accelerating Universe dominated by dark energy and dark matter.My research is focused on observational extragalactic astronomy and cosmology.

VOur laboratory discovered that the C. elegans homolog of the human insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulates the lifespan of C. elegans, thus demonstrating that aging is controlled hormonally. We showed that inhibiting receptor activity doubles lifespan and greatly extends youthfulness by changing the expression of downstream antioxidant, antimicrobial, chaperone, and metabolic genes. Our work has now led to the discovery that mammalian aging is also regulated hormonally by insulin and IGF-1 endocrine systems, and has catalyzed a fundamental shift in the way we view the aging process, from one that is inevitable and intractable to one that is plastic and subject to regulation. These long-lived mutants have been found to be resistant to several age-related diseases. Thus our work has raised the possibility of a new therapeutic strategy based on the ability to postpone the onset of age-related disease by slowing the aging process itself. By altering two hormone systems in the same animal-the insulin/IGF-1 system, and a second pathway we discovered that is controlled by the reproductive system, we can increase the lifespans of healthy, vigorous animals by six fold, demonstrating that truly remarkable extensions lifespan are possible.Our laboratory discovered that the C. elegans homolog of the human insulin and IGF-1 receptors regulates the lifespan of C. elegans, thus demonstrating that aging is controlled hormonally.

VKessler\u2019s research deals broadly with the social determinants of mental health and illness as studied from an epidemiological perspective. He is the Principal Investigator of the US National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), the first nationally representative survey of the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders in the U.S., and a series of NCS extensions. He oversees cross-national analyses of the WMH surveys, a series of comparative community epidemiological surveys of common mental disorders and their treatments in 26 countries around the world. He is a Principal in the Army Study of Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers, a multi-component study of modifiable risk and protective factors for suicide deaths and related outcomes among U.S. Army soldiers. His work in STARRS focuses both on analytic studies of risk and protective factors aimed at guiding preventive intervention planning and machine learning analyses aimed at targeting high-risk soldiers most likely to profit from preventive interventions. He also works with U.S. Veterans Administration to develop suicide prevention intervention targeting models. In addition to his epidemiological studies, Kessler is involved in evaluating diverse preventive interventions for individuals at high risk of mental disorders and related outcomes. Finally, he is a Principal in the Precision Treatment of Mental Disorders Initiative, a clinical epidemiological research program designed to develop and evaluate clinical decision support tools to help treatment providers select optimal treatments for mentally ill patients. Kessler is the author of nearly 1,000 scientific publications and one of the most widely-cited researchers in all of science in the world.Kessler\u2019s research deals broadly with the social determinants of mental health and illness as studied from an epidemiological perspective.

VMy research is in atomic physics and laser spectroscopy, particularly in the area of laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms with the goal of exploring new aspects of ultracold atomic matter. After the discovery of gaseous Bose-Einstein condensation large samples of ultracold atoms at nanokelvin temperatures are available. My research group uses such samples for various directions of research. Bose-Einstein condensates are a new quantum fluid. The interactions among the atoms make them an intriguing, novel many-body system. Aspects of interest are sound, superfluidity, and properties of miscible and immiscible multicomponent condensates. These topics are interdisciplinary with condensed matter physics. The coherence properties of the condensate are exploited in the field of atom optics. Coherent beams of atoms extracted from the condensate ("atom lasers") are analogous to optical laser beams. My research group has used Bose-Einstein condensates as amplifiers for light and for atoms. A third direction is precision measurements. The unprecedented control over the position and velocity of atoms provided by Bose-Einstein condensates is exploited for high-precision atom interferometry.My research is in atomic physics and laser spectroscopy, particularly in the area of laser cooling and trapping of neutral atoms with the goal of exploring new aspects of ultracold atomic matter.

VIn my research, we employ organic synthesis and polymer chemistry to explore interactions on the cell surface, especially those that mediated by proteins binding to carbohydrates. We have long been interested in elucidating and exploiting the biological roles of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates often function through multivalent interactions, processes in which multiple binding groups contact multiple receptors. Our work has demonstrated that multivalent carbohydrate - protein interactions can occur with high specificity, even when the individual protein and carbohydrate partners interact weakly and non-selectively. We exploited this specificity to develop a new anti-cancer strategy. We also constructed multivalent ligands that inhibit a protein (L-selectin) by inducing its proteolytic release from the cell-surface. We have demonstrated that multivalent ligands can be used to assemble cells, a finding that could be used to recruit natural killer cells to cancer cells or pathogens. Multivalent binding is prevalent in biology. Access to multivalent ligands, therefore, provides tools to study physiological processes beyond carbohydrate recognition. For example, using multivalent ligands as attractants in bacterial chemotaxis, we found that receptor-receptor interactions are critical for signal amplification, thereby demonstrating that sensing-receptors operate not as individuals but as an array.In my research, we employ organic synthesis and polymer chemistry to explore interactions on the cell surface, especially those that mediated by proteins binding to carbohydrates.

VMy research activities relate to quantum information science and to the quantum dynamics of open systems, including quantum measurement, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and the quantum-classical interface. A continuing theme is to exploit possibilities in the microscopic realm of quantum mechanics to accomplish tasks that would otherwise be impossible by classical means, such as for the processing and distribution of information. My research is in the area of optical physics and extends beyond traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics into a new regime with dynamical processes now involving atoms and photons taken one by one.  Within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics, my colleagues and I have been able to achieve strong coupling for the interactions of a single atom with the field of a high-quality optical resonator, with critical photon number of only 0.0002. We have succeeded in constructing an atom-cavity microscope that tracks the motion of individual Cesium atoms bound in orbit by single photons inside an optical cavity. To realize quantum networks, my colleagues and I have achieved unconditional quantum teleportation for coherent states of the electromagnetic field and are working to extend these capabilities for teleportation of the quantum states of matter.My research activities relate to quantum information science and to the quantum dynamics of open systems, including quantum measurement, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and the quantum-classical interface.

VI work on the mathematical theory of probability, and on some of its many applications. My purely theoretical work lies largely in Markov processes and Poisson processes.   I developed the theory of regenerative phenomena, partly to settle a difficult question of Kolmogorov on characterizing Markov transition probabilities. Although this theory is now mature, there are hard unsolved problems, for instance in limiting the possible oscillations of probabilities with time. I also work on sub additive processes, which have found many applications since I proved the ergodic theorem conjectured by Hammersley and Welsh. Among the applied areas of my interest is the analysis of queuing systems, which has recently become more active because for instance of congestion on the internet. I also work on mathematical problems in population genetics, seeking to clarify the biological explanations of genetic diversity. The simple concept of the coalescent, which describes the family tree of a group of individuals run backwards in time, has proved an effective approach to some of these problems.I work on the mathematical theory of probability, and on some of its many applications.

VMy work concerns the topology of manifolds. Thirty years ago it was high-dimensional (>4) manifolds that were not necessarily differentiable or even triangulable. But I switched to work on low dimensional manifolds and in particular 4-dimensional manifolds. At first the principal issue was the classification of simply connected 4-manifolds, in both the topological and differentiable categories. Beginning in the 1970s theoretical physics began having a large impact on this subject through gauge theory and topological quantum field theory. Gauge theory provided invariants in dimension 4 that led to great progress in classification, and now we work on many questions motivated, even if only distantly, by physics. Symplectic structures in even dimensions and contact structures in dimension 3 are becoming steadily more important. My interests might be described most succinctly as low-dimensional bordism theory, where the bordisms may have a variety of extra structure, from differentiable to almost complex, and the techniques involve increasing amounts of differential geometry.My work concerns the topology of manifolds.

VMy laboratory's program employs genetic approaches for the improvement and diversification of lactic acid bacteria that are used as starter cultures in food and dairy fermentations and as probiotics. Specific emphasis is on investigating the molecular mechanisms through which bacteria protect themselves against bacteriophage attack and developing novel mechanisms that circumvent phage infection, prevent proliferation, or close genetic routes for phage evolution. Recent efforts in genomics are investigating the molecular mechanisms responsible for the survival and activity of probiotic Lactobacillus species in the gastrointestinal tract and use of this information to develop live bacterial delivery systems for bioactive compounds in vivo (e.g., vaccines, enzymes). Teaching interests include food and dairy microbiology, fermentation bioprocessing, and food biotechnology, with special emphasis on the application of genomics and molecular biology to practical issues facing the developing food and dairy industries.My laboratory's program employs genetic approaches for the improvement and diversification of lactic acid bacteria that are used as starter cultures in food and dairy fermentations and as probiotics.

VI am a paleoanthropologist focusing on the fossil and archeological evidence for human evolution and particularly on the origins of fully modern humans. I have conducted field work in Spain and especially in South Africa, where I've analyzed animal remains from more than 100 archaeological and fossil sites dating between 500,000 years ago and the time of historic contact, about 500 years ago. I've shown how both species composition and average adult size in key mammalian species can be used to detect environmental change, including glacial/interglacial alternation, and I've developed criteria for distinguishing bone assemblages accumulated by people from ones accumulated by hyenas and other carnivores. However, I've worked mainly to illuminate long-term change in prehistoric human ability to hunt and gather. My research in South Africa implies that an especially important hunting-gathering advance occurred about 60,000-50,000 years ago. It promoted significantly larger populations and it has global implications, for it helps to explain how and why modern Africans expanded to Eurasia about the same time and how they then quickly replaced the Neanderthals and other non-modern Eurasians.I am a paleoanthropologist focusing on the fossil and archeological evidence for human evolution and particularly on the origins of fully modern humans.

VI am a neuroscientist interested in the neural basis of behavior. My research focuses on strategies of information processing and mechanisms of learning in the central auditory system. One of the primary functions of the auditory system is to determine the locations of sound stimuli in space. However, the location of a stimulus does not project directly onto the sensory surface of the ear. Therefore, the brain must derive stimulus location based on the evaluation of a variety of auditory cues. By studying the central auditory pathway in barn owls, my laboratory has discovered how the auditory system processes spatial cues to extract their meaning. We found that the brain can learn new interpretations of auditory spatial cues based on experience, especially experience that is gained prior to sexual maturation. We identified sites in the brain where the learning takes place, and we explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the learning, including changes in functional properties, anatomy and pharmacology. Our current research investigates the effects of early learning on the capacity for plasticity in the adult brain, mechanisms that account for the decline in plasticity with age, and strategies to increase brain plasticity in adult animals.I am a neuroscientist interested in the neural basis of behavior.

VI study the physics of how organisms interact with their environments. My goal is to elucidate basic physical rules that can be applied to different kinds of organisms about how body structure affects mechanical function in nature. I combine techniques from fluid and solid mechanics with those from biology to do experiments in the field as well as in the laboratory. Using both organisms and physical models, I have studied a variety of problems: the fluid dynamics of how molecules are captured by olfactory antennae and how food particles are filtered from the water by aquatic animals, the mechanisms by which bottom-dwelling marine organisms withstand waves and currents, the evolution of aerodynamic performance in insects and gliding vertebrates, the dispersal of chemical cues and of larvae in turbulent aquatic habitats, and the mechanics of how shape changes are produced in soft-bodied animals and developing embryos.I study the physics of how organisms interact with their environments.

VWith a background in condensed-matter physics and interests in earth and planetary sciences, my research focuses on physical and chemical properties of minerals and rocks at high pressures and temperatures, with particular emphasis on strength. Motivation for our experiments derives from the importance of quantifying the behavior of geological materials under extreme conditions as the basis for understanding and modeling the dynamical behavior and chemical evolution of deep interiors of terrestrial planets. Two central themes in my research involve fluids. First, we study physical mechanisms by which a small amount of water in the form of hydrogen dissolved in nominally anhydrous silicate minerals produces a dramatic reduction in strength. Water weakening has important consequences for convection in Earth's mantle by enabling plate tectonics, a phenomenon that is absent on Venus, a relatively dry planet often considered Earth's twin. A small amount of melt also profoundly affects the strength of otherwise crystalline rocks. Not only is the strength of a partially molten rock sensitive to melt distribution, but also melt distribution is profoundly influenced by deformation. This coupling between deformation and melt distribution results in self-organization of melt into melt-enriched shear zones that not only localize deformation but also provide high permeability paths for rapid transport of melt from depth to Earth's surface.With a background in condensed-matter physics and interests in earth and planetary sciences, my research focuses on physical and chemical properties of minerals and rocks at high pressures and temperatures, with particular emphasis on strength.

The pathways being investigated include DNA mismatch repair, homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining, the S-phase checkpoints, and the pathways that suppress the activity of telomerase on double strand breaks. Genetic approaches are being used to identify the genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that function in these pathways, and the proteins encoded by these genes are being studied to understand their biochemical function. We are also investigating whether the mouse and human homologs of the yeast genes identified play a role in cancer susceptibility, using patients suspected of inheriting increased risk for developing cancer.I seek to understand the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of genetic recombination and DNA repair, particularly those pathways that function to suppress chromosomal rearrangements and the accumulations of mutations due to errors in DNA metabolism.

VAs a solid state physicist, I have studied the electrical properties of metals, especially the electrical resistivity. The electrical resistivity of the metal usually decreases as the temperature decreases. However, when the metal contains a small amount of magnetic impurities such as iron or manganese, the resistivity turns to increase at about 10 or 20 degrees Kelvin. This fact was found in the year of 1930, and the reason of the rise of the resistivity has been a mystery. I calculated the scattering probability of the conduction electrons off the magnetic impurity up to the second Born approximation and found that the second Born term involved a term proportional to the logarithm of the temperature. The resistivity obtained using this scattering probability also involves a term proportional to the logarithm of the temperature and turned out to fit the experimental results very well.As a solid state physicist, I have studied the electrical properties of metals, especially the electrical resistivity.

VAs a sociocultural anthropologist, I have done ethnographic field work in Brazil (since 1962), Madagascar (since 1966), and the United States (since 1976). Most generally, my research interests are in the processes by which local cultures are incorporated-and resist incorporation-into larger systems. This interest links my earlier work on ecology and state formation in Africa and Madagascar to my current research on global change, national and international culture, and the mass media.  In recent research projects, in collaboration with Brazilian, French, Malagasy, and American colleagues, I have examined the emergence of ecological awareness in Brazil, the social context of deforestation and biodiversity conservation in Madagascar, and popular participation in economic development planning in northeastern Brazil. Most recently I have been active in the University of Michigan's Center for the Ethnography of Everyday Life.  In that capacity, for a research project titled "Media, Family, and Work in a Middle-Class Midwestern Town," I have investigated how middle-class families draw on various media in planning, managing, and evaluating their choices and solutions with respect to the competing demands of work and family.As a sociocultural anthropologist, I have done ethnographic field work in Brazil (since 1962), Madagascar (since 1966), and the United States (since 1976).

VI am interested in the chemistry and physics of life processes. I have focused on the biochemical mechanisms by which DNA is copied and maintained. DNA is broken almost every time a cell divides. Preservation of genetic information requires the repair of such DNA breaks, a chromosomal "restoration" that occurs by genetic recombination. My laboratory studies the biochemistry of recombinational DNA repair in prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archaea. DNA recombination requires many protein machines acting in concert. We study proteins responsible for recognition of DNA sequence homology and exchange of DNA strands (RecA, Rad51, RadA); for annealing complementary strands of DNA (Rec0, Rad52, Rad59); for processing DNA breaks (RecBCD, RecQ-helicases); and for accelerating assembly and disassembly of the recombination machinery (RecFOR, Rad52, Rad54, RecQ-helicases, Srs2). Recently, we developed biophysical methods to visualize single molecules of these proteins in action - "visual biochemistry". This is achieved using a laser to trap an individual DNA molecule. Then, using fluorescence and microscopic imaging, we can visualize DNA motor proteins translocating along DNA strands - their "tracks". We also can build assemblies of individual proteins, one molecule at a time, on single DNA molecules to see their unique, rather than collective, dynamic behavior in real-time.I am interested in the chemistry and physics of life processes.

VMy research has focused on four themes: (i) Animal Communication.  In the late 1970s, together with Dawkins, I challenged the then received wisdom that animal communication is cooperative.  Instead we argued signallers exploit receivers and vice versa.  (ii) Foraging strategies.  In collaboration with Charnov, Stephens, Kacelnik and others, I developed the idea that economic models of decision-making could be applied to foraging animals and used to predict both the distribution of foraging effort across patches, and the choice of prey items within a patch.  (iii) Memory adaptations and the brain.  Together with Sherry, Shettleworth, Clayton and others, I developed a research programme to investigate the relationship between spatial memory, neuroanatomical specialisation in the brain and food-storing behaviour.  (iv) Population ecology.  In my early work I analysed the relationship between food supply and territorial behaviour in limiting bird populations.  More recently I have led a team investigating the ways in which modern farming practice has caused declines in many bird populations in the UK.  I have also spent eleven years at the interface between science and policy, both in relation to the environment and in relation to food safety and nutrition.My research has focused on four themes: (i) Animal Communication.

VKrieger's group has studied receptor biology at the molecular, cellular and whole organism levels. Analysis of low density lipoprotein (LDL, 'bad' cholesterol) receptors in cells identified genes that influence the Golgi apparatus. For example, he co-discovered the Conserved Oligomeric Golgi Complex, in which mutations can cause human 'congenital disorders of glycosylation'.  His interest in cholesterol metabolism and innate immunity led to the molecular identification and characterization of several 'scavenger receptors'. He proposed and helped establish that one of these serves in immune defense as a broad specificity pattern recognition receptor for pathogens (such as bacteria or asbestos). It was one of the first such receptors identified. His group also discovered and characterized the first high density lipoprotein (HDL, 'good' cholesterol) receptor.  It's distinctive mechanism of cholesterol transport differs from that of the classic 'LDL receptor pathway'. Krieger's group showed that HDL receptors control the regulated delivery of HDL cholesterol to tissues, influence gastrointestinal, endocrine, reproductive and cardiovascular physiology, and protect against female infertility, certain blood disorders and atherosclerosis. This work generated new animal models for studying atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and suggests that the HDL receptor is a potential target for pharmacologic prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.Krieger's group has studied receptor biology at the molecular, cellular and whole organism levels.

VMost of my research interests concern the Physics and Technology of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Devices. Within this broad field, there have been four overlapping areas of emphasis: (a) Semiconductor heterostructures have been a dominant theme from the beginning of my research career, starting with an inquiry into the effects of energy gap variations on the carrier transport in structures containing a position-dependent gap. This led to device concepts such as heterostructure bipolar transistors and double-heterostructure lasers. Work on the physics of the band lineups at abrupt hetero-interfaces followed, which in turn led to continuing research on quantum well and superlattice structures. (b) A second area, also dating from the beginning of my research career, has been nonlinear electron transport, especially negative-resistance effects at high electric fields, ranging from the Gunn effect in bulk semiconductors to Bloch oscillations in superlattices. (c) Molecular-beam epitaxy technology of semiconductor systems other than the GaAs/AlGaAs system -- and of heterostructures based on them -- was an important area of my research from 1977 through 1999. (d) Straddling the border between semiconductors and supercondutors is research on semiconductor-coupled superconductive weak links in the almost unexplored near-ballistic "clean" limit.Most of my research interests concern the Physics and Technology of Semiconductors and Semiconductor Devices.

VPresent research programme in N&N (Nanoscience and Nanotechnology) at FSU focuses on the self-assembly of atomic and molecular components into supramolecular matrices whose bulk properties reflect intrinsic behavior manifested only at nanoscale dimensions e.g. molecular dynamics, quantum behavior etc. It is a nanoscale materials science and chemical physics programme which uses chemical and biochemical approaches to probe the assembly of networks into extended 2-dimensional flat arrays as well as discrete closed cage structures. Electron microscopy and mass spectrometric techniques are being used to explore the factors governing nanostructure growth. The programme capitalizes on experience gained during the last decade in nanoscale materials science at FSU and the Sussex N&N Centre (SNNC) at Sussex University (cf www.snnc.sussec.ac.uk). Specific projects involve: novel nanostructures with intrinsic functional behavior such as 2D arrays of chemically bonded molecular clusters some of which are molecular magnets: Synthetics routes to carbon nanostructures; Electrolytic assembly of carbon nanostructures on templated surface; Protein oligomer and DNA self-assembly of molecular scaffolds; the detailed investigation of carbon vapor by very high resolution mass spectrometric techniques. In addition a recording/broadcasting studio has been built at FSU to develop new ways of using the Internet for educational purposes. This Global Educational Outreach (GEO) initiative is already broadcasting on the web.Present research programme in N&N (Nanoscience and Nanotechnology) at FSU focuses on the self-assembly of atomic and molecular components into supramolecular matrices whose bulk properties reflect intrinsic behavior manifested only at nanoscale dimensions e.g. molecular dynamics, quantum behavior etc. It is a nanoscale materials science and chemical physics programme which uses chemical and biochemical approaches to probe the assembly of networks into extended 2-dimensional flat arrays as well as discrete closed cage structures.

Astronomers now believe that massive stars die violently in supernova explosions, leaving a neutron star or a black hole. However, there is huge diversity in the resulting objects. The extreme astronomical conditions associated with these objects -- highest energy, strongest magnetic field, rapid rotation -- make them attractive as natural laboratories to probe extreme physics. Planets around other stars and alien life forms has fascinated all cultures over the ages. We are now in a position to experimentally address the first question.

VI am interested in the proteins that carry out two fundamental processes: the replication of DNA and the transduction of cellular signals. I use X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of these proteins and I then try to figure out how they work. One question my laboratory focuses on is how tyrosine phosphorylation is used as a switch in the processing of information received by animal cells. We determined the structure of the "SH2 domain," a protein module that recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Important clues to how SH2 domains work have come from our structures of protein switches that are regulated by SH2 domains, including that of the Src tyrosine kinase and the STAT transcription factor. My laboratory has collaborated in determining the structure of the "sliding clamp" protein, which allows the polymerases that replicate DNA to move at very high speed without letting go of DNA. The protein forms a ring that encircles DNA, providing a mobile platform to which the DNA polymerase is attached. We have also analyzed the structure of the "clamp-loader" protein assembly, which uses energy stored in ATP to open the ring-shaped sliding clamps and load them on DNA.I am interested in the proteins that carry out two fundamental processes: the replication of DNA and the transduction of cellular signals.

VAs a climate scientist, I have studied present, past and future climates. I used multivariate techniques to describe interannual climate variability using empirical orthogonal functions; these techniques remain at the core of modern-day climate analysis procedures. I conducted some of the initial studies of past climates using computer-based climate models, showing that: i) changes in earth's orbital characteristics (precession, tilt and eccentricity) have had a profound effect on the strength of the Asian and African monsoons over the past half-million years; ii) changes in the heights of mountains and plateaus have influenced large-scale climate over the past ten million years; and iii) changes in continent size and shape have influenced monsoons over the past two hundred million years. Working with geologists and ecologists, these simulations of past climate have been validated by detailed comparisons with observations. Additional studies have shown the importance of ocean and biosphere feedbacks, as well as the role of greenhouse gas changes, in causing climate change. These studies of past climates have helped to assess the accuracy of climate models, which is an important benchmark for studies of future climate. My most recent work involves understanding the possible effects of future greenhouse gas increases on the global hydrologic budget and regional changes in water availability and vegetation.As a climate scientist, I have studied present, past and future climates.

VResearch in my laboratory focuses on the biosynthesis, structure-function, and evolution of the photoreceptor phytochrome, a photoactivatable biliprotein that plays a key role in a plant's response to its light environment (i.e., photomorphogenesis). The molecular basis of phytochrome action depends on its ability to photointerconvert between two stable isomers, a property conferred by a covalently bound linear tetrapyrrole (bilin) pigment. Using biochemical and molecular genetic approaches, we have elucidated the pathway of bilin biosynthesis and its attachment to the phytochrome apoprotein. We have exploited this knowledge to regulate the light responsiveness of transgenic plants through expression of enzymes that alter the structure of the bilin precursor. The development of methodologies for reconstitution of functional phytochromes both in vitro and in living cells, in combination with the discovery of phytochromes in prokaryotes, has enabled us to establish that phytochromes are light-regulated enzymes. Through directed evolution and bioorganic chemistry we seek to develop novel biliprotein-based fluorescent and photochromic biomolecules tailored for use as molecular tags and/or as regulators of gene expression in living plant, microbial, and animal cells.Research in my laboratory focuses on the biosynthesis, structure-function, and evolution of the photoreceptor phytochrome, a photoactivatable biliprotein that plays a key role in a plant's response to its light environment (i.e., photomorphogenesis).

VAs a political scientist, I have studied how cultural differences impact on political life. I have studied several attempts of language communities to ensure official status of their languages - the Somalis in challenging the colonial administrative system in Italian and English, the Catalans in challenging Castilian linguistic hegemony in Spain, and the Russian-speakers in challenging the nationalizing policies in post-Soviet Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan - specifying the conditions when groups succeed. I have studied as well the conditions under which religious difference in a society becomes a matter of political competition, having done fieldwork in southwestern Nigeria where Muslims and Christians have been surprisingly tolerant of one another. These studies led me to statistical examinations of the (what turned out to be non-significant) role of ethnic, linguistic and religious difference for explaining civil war onsets, and the (significant) relationship of religious difference for suicide terrorism.As a political scientist, I have studied how cultural differences impact on political life.

VI have worked on the solar environment, which includes the galactic gas in the Sun vicinity, the interaction between our star and the interstellar medium it is moving through, and the confinement of the expanding solar wind by this medium to form the heliosphere.  We have identified the local interstellar cloud surrounding the Sun, using nearby star spectroscopy, and shown that its temperature and motion are identical to those of the interstellar helium flow within the heliosphere, establishing a "bridge" between the solar system and the galactic environment. Using remote sensing observations of the interstellar gas, we have shown that some interstellar species are modified upon entry in the heliosphere, in particular neutral hydrogen is decelerated and heated. This allows us to determine the ionized fraction of the ambient interstellar gas as well as the size of our heliosphere.  We have also derived some characteristics of the interaction processes between the solar wind and the inflowing interstellar gas, such as the decrease of hydrogen ionization above the solar poles. We have recently measured a huge increase of helium ionization within the earth orbit with rising solar activity; this phenomenon, due to solar wind electron impact, influences the fluxes of energetic helium ions.  Because the local interstellar medium properties result from the history of our "galactic corner", we have studied the interstellar medium at larger scale. Ground and space observing programs have resulted in the detection of the group of nearby interstellar clouds, and, more recently, in the first computed maps of the Local Interstellar Cavity, a 100 parsecs volume filled by hot gas, a "remnant" of stellar explosions. We can trace back and forth in time the trajectory of our Sun in this cavity and in the embedded nearby interstellar clouds.I have worked on the solar environment, which includes the galactic gas in the Sun vicinity, the interaction between our star and the interstellar medium it is moving through, and the confinement of the expanding solar wind by this medium to form the heliosphere.

VAs a virologist I study the replication and biology of two groups of enveloped viruses, influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses. These viruses are being studied not only because of their importance to human and animal health but also because they are excellent models for understanding a variety of properties of integral membrane proteins. As the viral integral proteins are the major antigenic determinants of the viruses, knowledge about their structure should enhance our understanding of how to develop new vaccines. In addition, some of the biochemical activities of the viruses are essential to the virus, making them attractive as points of intervention in the virus life cycle to which rationally designed therapeutic agents can be developed. Several different projects are under study: (1) Understanding the mechanism by which viruses enter cells by virus-mediated membrane fusion. Both influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses encode glycoproteins that are molecular machines that undergo a cascade of controlled conformational changes leading to the coalescence of the viral membrane with a cellular membrane; (2) The protein-protein interactions necessary for virus assembly and the role of lipid raft microdomains in this process; (3) The structure and function of the minimalistic protein-selective influenza virus-encoded ion channels, M2 and BM2; (4) Endocytosis and degradations signals in viral glycoproteins; (5) The interaction of multifunctional viral proteins with cellular proteins to control both the cell cycle and antagonize the cellular innate immune system; (6) Using reverse genetics to understand viral pathogenesis. We use a multidisciplinary approach using techniques from molecular biology, cell biology, genetics, biochemistry and structural biology (X-ray crystallography and NMR) to address these questions.As a virologist I study the replication and biology of two groups of enveloped viruses, influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses.

VMy research interests have ranged through the disciplines of geophysics, geodesy and geology with a focus on the deformations of the Earth on intermediate and long time scales and on the interactions between surface processes and the solid earth. Past research areas have included the determination of the Earth's gravity field from satellite tracking data, the tidal deformations and rotational motion of the Earth, the evolution of the Earth-Moon orbital system, and lithospheric and crustal deformation processes. My more recent research work has focused on sea level change and the history of the Earth's ice sheets during past glacial cycles, including field and laboratory work and numerical modelling. The geophysical focus of this work is on quantifying the depth and lateral variation in the viscosity of the Earth's mantle and the palaeo-climate focus of the work is to understand the evolution of the ice sheets during the last glacial cycle. A third focus is on the significance of sea level and glacial cycles on archaeological and pre-historical investigations and on constraints on the possible movements and activities of Late Palaeolithic and Neolithic man.My research interests have ranged through the disciplines of geophysics, geodesy and geology with a focus on the deformations of the Earth on intermediate and long time scales and on the interactions between surface processes and the solid earth.

VMy research concerns four interrelated themes: (i) The detection of land cover changes at regional scales based on time series of wide-field-of-view Earth observation satellites. This work contributed to a better understanding of the geographic distribution of biodiversity and the dynamics of forest and savannah fires in Africa. (ii) Integrated approaches to study human-environment interactions, linking remote sensing and socio-economic data. This research allowed for a better modelling of causes and impacts of tropical deforestation, desertification, and conflicts between wildlife and agriculture around large African national parks. (iii) Responses by rural communities to environmental changes. Attention is being paid to the transition from environmental degradation to environmental restoration that is taking place since a few years in some developing countries, in tropical forest regions or drylands. (iv) The impact of land change on emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases that are transmitted by vectors (ticks, mosquitoes, flies). An integrated analysis at the landcape scale of changes in ecosystems and climate, the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents, human behaviour, land use, and agricultural practices contributes to better understand the emergence of diseases. All this research work helps identifying the conditions under which a society adopts more sustainable practices when using the natural environment.My research concerns four interrelated themes: (i) The detection of land cover changes at regional scales based on time series of wide-field-of-view Earth observation satellites.

VMy laboratory studies genetic elements called group I and group II introns, which are found inserted within genes in diverse organisms. Although these introns are catalytic RNAs that under artificial conditions excise themselves from gene transcripts by "self-splicing", we showed that their splicing in cells requires proteins that help fold the intron RNA into the catalytically active structure. Such protein-assisted RNA catalysis is now known to underlie fundamental processes in higher organisms. We also showed that group II introns can move to different DNA sites by a remarkable mechanism in which the excised intron RNA inserts directly into DNA and is then copied from RNA into DNA by an intron-encoded reverse transcriptase. This discovery has implications for the origin and spread of introns within genomes, as well as the evolution of viruses and mobile genetic elements. Moreover, the mechanism we elucidated makes it possible to precisely control the site of intron insertion, enabling us to develop novel group II intron-based gene targeting vectors, with potential applications in genetic engineering, functional genomics, and gene therapy. We are continuing to study the fundamental properties of group I and group II introns, their splicing and mobility mechanisms, and their practical applications.My laboratory studies genetic elements called group I and group II introns, which are found inserted within genes in diverse organisms.

VThe primary goal of my research has been to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of neural circuits during development and the role of spontaneous electrical activity. Using the spinal cord as a model system, my laboratory has demonstrated the early specification of motoneuron subtypes and their highly precise axonal outgrowth and synapse formation, indicating that specific chemical guidance cues and differentially distributed receptors for them must exist. Many laboratories are currently identifying these recognition molecules. We also characterized the local spinal circuits that produce spontaneous electrical activity and found that such activity modulated many aspects of neuromuscular development.  I also study the role of the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM in neuromuscular development. In vivo alteration of the function of NCAM or its level of sialylation showed that by modulating axon-axon adhesion NCAM plays important roles in motor axon pathfinding and intramuscular nerve branching. Using NCAM-deficient mice, we have recently found that NCAM is also required for the proper maturation of transmitter release and vesicle cycling machinery at the neuromuscular junction. We are now trying to understand how the different isoforms of NCAM regulate such presynaptic organization.The primary goal of my research has been to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of neural circuits during development and the role of spontaneous electrical activity.

VMy interests are in the solid earth geochemical cycle, and understanding the mechanisms that control material transfer among Earth's reservoirs.  To explore these questions we make use of chemical analyses of all types of rocks, both to understand the systematics of the chemical diversity, and to compare the data to quantitative models of Earth processes.  This work has led to hypotheses for the origin of the compositional diversity of the major silicate rocks types of the ocean floor, ocean islands and convergent margins, and their relationship to aspects of mantle convection, plate tectonics, and ocean sediment compositions.  The understanding of modern Earth processes has led to current research projects exploring how these processes may have changed through time, and how the composition and stability of ocean and atmosphere, and the habitability of Earth for life, have been influenced by solid Earth processes.My interests are in the solid earth geochemical cycle, and understanding the mechanisms that control material transfer among Earth's reservoirs.

The understanding of modern Earth processes has led to current research projects exploring how these processes may have changed through time, and how the composition and stability of ocean and atmosphere, and the habitability of Earth for life, have been influenced by solid Earth processes.

VMy career has focussed primarily on theoretical and experimental population dynamics and community ecology. My earliest work was on the ecological energetics of Odonata (dragonflies), and my main long-term studies continued over many years to use insects as model systems for a range of different ecological questions, particularly the insect assemblage feeding on bracken-fern (Pteridium aquilinum) at sites all over the world. In the middle of my career I worked extensively on theoretical and empirical studies of food-webs. Most recently I have been interested in the impacts of global environmental change on populations, communities and ecosystems, and on applying fundamental principles of population dynamics to conservation biology. I have also worked on biological pest control, and whilst I was at Imperial College I pioneered the use of a large-scale controlled environment facility (the Ecotron) for ecological research into the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to species loss, climate change and rising CO2 concentrations. Throughout my career I have promoted the study of large scale patterns and processes in ecology, in the sub-discipline now known as 'macro-ecology'. I am no longer active in research, but concentrate instead on how science is translated into government policy, and how to enhance and improve the use of environmental science in decision-making by governments.My career has focussed primarily on theoretical and experimental population dynamics and community ecology.

VThe Earth resides in the astronomical neighborhood of the Sun, whose electromagnetic radiation enables our terrestrial society. Solar energy at visible and infrared wavelengths heats the Earth's surface and powers the climate system. Solar ultraviolet radiation creates ozone in the atmosphere that protects the biosphere from harmful radiation at shorter wavelengths. Radiation in the EUV and X-ray spectrum controls the temperature and composition of the Earth's upper atmosphere and creates the ionosphere. Solar radiation varies continuously. Even the total radiative output- the so-called solar "constant" - exhibits fluctuations associated with the Sun's 11-year activity cycle, and may vary on longer time scales. Measurements and models of total, ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet irradiance variability enable simulations of a wide variety of variable terrestrial phenomena on time scales from minutes to millennia. The Earth's responses to variations in solar energy output are well established in outer atmospheric layers, where temperature changes of hundreds of degrees occur during the 11-year solar cycle. Ozone levels and the state of the middle atmosphere also respond to variable solar inputs, but much less dramatically. The extent of climate change associated with solar variability remains controversial because substantial empirical evidence is, in general, inconsistent with present understanding of the mechanisms of climate change encapsulated in current general circulation models. The behavior of the extended Sun-Earth system is of increasing importance for commerce and defense, as well as for policy making on issues of global change.The Earth resides in the astronomical neighborhood of the Sun, whose electromagnetic radiation enables our terrestrial society.

VAs a virologist I have studied Japanese encephalitis (JE) and Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF), now called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The first of these is the success of tissue culture of JE virus, immune mechanism of JE and overwintering mechanisms of JE virus in Korea from 1955 to 1968. The second of these is the isolation of etiologic agents, epidemiology, and prevention of HFRS from 1969 to 2001. I isolated etiologic agents of KHF from Apodemus mice and urban rats and named the virus Hantaan and Seoul in 1976 and 1980, respectively. I elucidated epizootiology and epidemiology of HFRS in 1979 through 1985. Hantaan virus is the origin of genus Hantavirus. We also proved worldwide distribution of hantaviruses in 1977 through 2000. In 1990 my colleagues and I developed a simple rapid diagnostic kit and an inactivated vaccine against HFRS, which after its introduction to Asia significantly reduced the number of HFRS patients there. More recently I have been trying to produce a commercial combination vaccine that will prevent both Hantaan and Puumala virus infections in Eurasia. I have already developed an effective inactivated Hantaan-Puumala combination vaccine.As a virologist I have studied Japanese encephalitis (JE) and Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF), now called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).

VGerm cells are the stem cells for the next generation. Set-aside during embryogenesis from the somatic cells that form the body of the organism, germ cells, through the fusion of sperm and egg, generate a new organism. Research in our lab focuses on the biology of germ cells in Drosophila. We are interested in how germ cell fate is initiated and maintained and how germ cells evade the ultimately deadly fate of the soma. As germ cells \u201cmake\u201d germ cells, the work in our lab follows the germ line life cycle: RNA regulation plays a prominent and highly conserved role in germ cells. We are interested in how a specific subset of mRNAs organizes within specialized RNA granules to specify germ cell fate in the early embryo. We have identified lipid-signaling pathways that guide germ cells through the embryo to reach the somatic gonad. Systematic genetic analysis has provided a framework how germline stem cells are maintained throughout larval and adult life and mature in order to generate a new organism. Because germ cells face unique challenges associated with totipotency and immortality, we are intrigued by germline-specific defense mechanisms against pathogens and transposable elements.Germ cells are the stem cells for the next generation.

VI am broadly interested in the ecological and genetic processes that underlie evolution.  I pursue an experimental approach to evolution by using bacteria to take advantage of their rapid generations and large populations.  In one experiment that started 18 years ago, my lab monitors 12 populations of Escherichia coli as they evolve in a defined environment for over 40,000 generations.  We characterize the dynamics of adaptation and divergence as well as identify genetic changes responsible for adaptation.  In other projects, we have performed experiments with bacteria, viruses, and plasmids to test hypotheses about the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite interactions.  We have shown the importance of compensatory mutations for the spread of antibiotic resistance.  We have studied the evolution of mutation rates, and the mathematical form of interactions among mutations.  We provided experimental support for some alternatives to the controversial hypothesis of 'directed' mutation.  We examined sociality in the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus and discovered genotypes that 'cheat' by behaviors that enhance their fitness while harming group performance.  For the last decade, I have collaborated on multi-disciplinary research with 'digital organisms' - computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete, and evolve - that explores the evolution of biological complexity including metabolic networks, sexual reproduction, and ecological communities.I am broadly interested in the ecological and genetic processes that underlie evolution.

VI am experimental psychologist whose research has been in two areas, the first being in visual and auditory psychophysics. In the visual domain, I have worked on binocular rivalry and on binocular brightness and color summation. In the auditory domain my research has addressed issues of binaural loudness summation and the perception of musical consonance. My second and current research area is in psycholinguistics, with emphasis on the process of speaking, the way speakers map intentions onto articulations. I have been developing a general theoretical framework for dissecting this process into its component operations, some of which are the topic of detailed experimental and computational analyses. Among the analyses are the operations of linearization (the mapping of multi-dimensional information, such as spatial visual information, onto a "linear" spoken text), of self-monitoring (which can lead to spontaneous self-repair), and the core operation of lexical access (the selection and phonological encoding of an appropriate target word). In all cases it has been possible to measure the time course of an operation, either through reaction time experiments or by neuroimaging.I am experimental psychologist whose research has been in two areas, the first being in visual and auditory psychophysics.

VMy principal interests are in understanding how macroscopic patterns and processes are maintained at the level of ecosystems and the biosphere in terms of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that operated primarily at the level of organisms. Much of my work is concerned with the evolution of diversification, the mechanisms sustaining biological diversity in natural systems, and the implications for ecosystem structure and functioning. The work integrates empirical studies and mathematical modeling, with emphasis on how to extrapolate across scales of space, time, and organizational complexity. The essential mathematical challenge is the development of macroscopic descriptions for the collective behavior of large, heterogeneous ensembles that are subject to continual evolutionary modifications. Specific attention is directed to evolution and ecology of dispersal. Current systems of study include plant communities and marine open-ocean and intertidal systems. I have also been interested in the self-organization and evolution of strain structure in influenza A. I have also been involved in the conservation implications of the basic ecological work, with emphasis on reserve design and on economic linkages.My principal interests are in understanding how macroscopic patterns and processes are maintained at the level of ecosystems and the biosphere in terms of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that operated primarily at the level of organisms.

VAs one of the first computational biologists I have contributed in four areas: methodology, analysis of protein and nucleic acid structure, molecular dynamics, and ab initio protein folding. My interactions with experimentalists led to the Jack-Levitt method for refining coordinates against X-ray data and early use of restraints and annealing in folding forms the basis for current methods of NMR structure determination. In structural analysis I co-discovered the four protein fold classes and the packing geometry of secondary structure segments. An early model for tRNA captured many features of the subsequently determined X-ray structure, and a prediction that DNA has 10.5, not 10, base pairs per turn in solution was later experimentally verified. My early calculations of energies and forces paved the way for protein molecular dynamics simulations; they led to realistic simulations in solution and a widely adopted approach to protein unfolding. I introduced simplified representations of proteins for simulation of protein folding and popularized the commonly used decoy/discrimination paradigm. Recent work on the comparison of sequences and structures has led to a number of popular web-based bioinformatics resources. I remain an active programmer, a craft skill of which I am particularly proud.As one of the first computational biologists I have contributed in four areas: methodology, analysis of protein and nucleic acid structure, molecular dynamics, and ab initio protein folding.

My early calculations of energies and forces paved the way for protein molecular dynamics simulations; they led to realistic simulations in solution and a widely adopted approach to protein unfolding. I introduced simplified representations of proteins for simulation of protein folding and popularized the commonly used decoy/discrimination paradigm. Recent work on the comparison of sequences and structures has led to a number of popular web-based bioinformatics resources. I remain an active programmer, a craft skill of which I am particularly proud.

VI have been studying compound semiconductor materials for 45 years. Since 1980, my research interests has been focused on III-V compound semiconductor quantum structures for high speed electronic heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), high mobility transistors (HEMTs), and optoelectronic interband bipolar multi-quantum well lasers (MQWLDs) and photodetectors (PDs) using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) crystal growth technology. I have been studying impurity engineering, band engineering, the dispersion mechanisms caused by mid-far infrared radiation, and MBE growth mechanisms mainly on GaAs-based, GaSb-based and InP-based lattice-matched materials. More recently, my special attention has been on impurity engineering and band engineering covering from lattice matched materials to high strained-relaxed lattice-mismatched materials. Our aim is to establish a fundamental model that connects the impurity engineering with band structures in order to optimize structure design and MBE growth conditions for mid-far infrared intersubband unipolar quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). We also pay particular emphasis on the thermal management study for QCL. All these research topics are essential for microwave transmision, wireless communication, trace gas sensing for moritoring chemical processing, pollution, homeland security, and medical imaging.I have been studying compound semiconductor materials for 45 years.

VI have been interested in molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics. There are currently two main projects going on the lab.   I. Evolution of regulatory modules and networks   The significance of regulatory evolution has been recognized since the 1960s. For example, the conspicuous morphological differences between humans and chimpanzees were suggested to be mainly due to regulatory differences between the two species. However, regulatory evolution has not been much studied in the past mainly because of scarcity of suitable data. Fortunately, advances in molecular biology and genomics in recent years have enabled one to study not only the regulation of single genes, but also the co-regulation of many genes. Thus, one can now pursue detailed investigation of regulatory evolution, including the evolution of regulatory modules, which are sets of co-regulated genes, and will soon be able to study the evolution of the entire regulatory network in closely related eukaryotes.   To pursue this project we are using both theoretical and experimental approaches. First, we are developing methods for inferring regulatory modules from microarray data and real time PCR data and for comparing data from different strains or species. The purposes are to infer which genes are on the same module and how modules interact, and to understand how modules diverge between strains or species. Second, we are using yeast as a model organism to obtain microarray data and real time PCR data for the above purposes.    II. Evolution of duplicate genes at the genomic level  Since Ohno (1970) it has been commonly believed that gene duplication is the primary source of genetic novelties.  In the past, however, the study of the evolution of duplicate genes had relied mainly on isozyme data. Taking advantage of the availability of genomic sequence data and functional genomic data, we have been pursuing this topic at the genomic level, e.g, developing methods for detecting duplicate genes in a genome and for estimating the rate of gene duplication in a genome. Our current interests are: (1) The mode and tempo of expression divergence between duplicate genes. We are using microarray and other data to study how often and how fast duplicate genes diverge in expression, because regulatory divergence is commonly thought to be the first step for functional divergence between duplicate genes. (2) Determinants of gene duplicability. What factors determine the retention of both copies of duplicate genes in a genome? We are studying such factors as function, protein complexity (number of subunits in a protein), organismal complexity, etc. (3) The role of duplicate genes in the genetic robustness against null mutation. The deletion or knockout of a gene often shows no discernible phenotypic effect. Is this mainly due to the existence of duplicate genes or due to alternative pathways?I have been interested in molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics.

VAs an experimental physicist, I have studied the implications of nonlinear dynamics on the physical world, including the biological sciences. On the physical world, we studied the various routes to a chaotic state and some scaling properties of chaotic and turbulent states. I am now working on aspects of cell biology related to artificial life, the origin of life, and some physical aspects of cell biology. Recently, I have undertaken a whole new series of experiments, the results of which may hold clues to the origins of life. I am working to define the minimal conditions needed to produce an artificial cell. The ultimate aim is to produce an artificial cell that self-reproduces following a genetic program. Another important concept at the origin of life is the development of a genetic code that relates the 20 amino-acid world to the 4 nucleotide one. We are trying to show that a RNA molecule of a stem-loop structure, acting as a ribozyme, can load an amino-acid to its 3' end, without enzymes. Past research in my lab has elucidated the effects of temperature on DNA. We showed that the polymerase chain reaction (PCT) can be sustained in a thermal convective cell. Because this phenomenon could be used to sustain very high concentrations of DNA or proteins, it sheds light on how critical concentrations of DNA may have been reached amid early primordial soup.As an experimental physicist, I have studied the implications of nonlinear dynamics on the physical world, including the biological sciences.

VMy laboratory has been identifying genes that contribute to development of vascular disease in humans and determining how these mutations alter normal physiology to result in clinical disease. Many of the common diseases encountered in clinical medicine, such as coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, and renal disease, are known to have strong genetic components, indicating that inheritance of genetic variants contributes to their occurrence. With the advent of new tools in molecular genetics we now have the capability to identify these susceptibility loci. This identification can provide new insight into disease pathophysiology, provide new tests capable of identifying individuals with inherited susceptibility at pre-clinical stages, and ultimately lead to new therapies tailored to individuals with underlying primary abnormalities.My laboratory has been identifying genes that contribute to development of vascular disease in humans and determining how these mutations alter normal physiology to result in clinical disease.

VMy research interests address the Interacting Particle Systems which is a branch of probability theory that is devoted to the study of certain types of stochastic models that arise in a number of areas of science. Infinitely many agents evolve in time according to probabilistic rules that involve interactions among them. Depending on the area of application, these agents may be ribosomes that read genetic information, cars in traffic, atoms in a magnetic material, viruses in plants, or cells in a tumor. The main problems involve the long time behavior of the system, and how this depends on the details of local interaction rules. During my career, I have contributed to most aspects of the development of this subject, including the rigorous construction of the processes, and the analysis of some of the major types of models, such as exclusion, voter and contact. My 1985 and 1999 books have played a substantial role in evolution of this area. In addition, I have proved results in other parts of mathematics that have applications of a different type. Examples are a generation theorem for semigroups of nonlinear contractions, which is one of the major tools in the study of evolution equations, and a subadditive ergodic theorem, which guarantees the existence of limits for many stochastic systems.My research interests address the Interacting Particle Systems which is a branch of probability theory that is devoted to the study of certain types of stochastic models that arise in a number of areas of science.

VI am one of the authors of inflationary cosmology, and most of my research interests are still related to this theory. According to inflationary theory, the universe at the very early stages of its evolution came through the stage of an exponentially rapid expansion (inflation) in an unstable vacuum-like state. Even if this stage is very short, inflation stretches the universe enormously, which solves many of the problems of the earlier versions of the Big Bang theory. Small quantum fluctuations stretched by inflation eventually grow large enough to produce galaxies. In some cases, not only galaxies but also new parts of inflationary universe are unceasingly produced, and inflation becomes eternal. In this process, the universe becomes divided into infinitely many exponentially large regions where different laws of low-energy physics may operate. This observation is the basis of the theory of the inflationary multiverse and string theory landscape, which I am helping to develop now, in parallel to my work on observational consequences of various versions of inflationary cosmology.I am one of the authors of inflationary cosmology, and most of my research interests are still related to this theory.

My early research focused on the signaling functions in T cells of the CD4 and CD8 coreceptor molecules, whose expression defines helper versus cytotoxic functions, respectively. This work has evolved in several directions, ranging from gene regulation in T lymphocyte development to how lymphoid organs are induced and to the mechanisms by which the human immunodeficiency virus exploits components of the human immune system. My laboratory identified and characterized a gene silencer that regulates heritable expression of CD4 in cytotoxic T cells. We also identified CD4 and the chemokine receptor CCR5 as the receptor complex used by HIV for entry into T helper cells and macrophages. More recently, we showed that engulfment of HIV into vesicles within dendritic cells, the sentinel cells that usually protect us from infection, permits the virus to more effectively infect T cells. A better understanding of how HIV survives in dendritic cells and traverses them to reach T cells may provide new ammunition to attack drug-resistant viral reservoirs.My long-standing interest has been in understanding at the molecular level how the vertebrate immune system achieves its diversity of functions and its exquisite specificity.

VAs a psychological scientist, I have studied human memory. My earliest studies demonstrated that innocuous procedures could alter memories of past events. In early experiments, experimental witnesses to an event were later interviewed with questions that insinuated novel (and incorrect) information into the memory record of the event. For example, after watching a simulated auto accident, the question "Did another car pass the red Datsun while it was at the stop sign?" led interviewees who had seen a yield sign to later recall having seen a stop sign at the intersection. The contamination or distortion of memory through post-event suggestion became known in the field of cognitive psychology as the "Misinformation Effect." In later research, I developed paradigms for exploring extreme instances of a malleable memory. In one study (called the 'lost in the mall' study) I demonstrated the ease with which one could create, in adults, 'recovered' unpleasant memories of having been, as a child, separated from a parent on a shopping trip, and after great distress being rescued and reunited with the family. My later studies showed how imagination, or exposure to other people's stories, or dream interpretation, or a multitude of suggestive techniques could lead people to have wholly false beliefs and memories about their past. My desire to understand the processes by which people develop "rich false memories" has motivated much of research.As a psychological scientist, I have studied human memory.

VResearch in my laboratory concentrates on the neural mechanisms of perception and object recognition. Although our basic research revolves around vision, a number of independent collaborators are also investigating the relationship between neural activity and perception using other sensory modalities. I firmly believe that such scientific questions require a multimodal methodological approach that integrates information obtained from single units with that derived from mass action potentials as well as from a number of activity-related, surrogate signals such as those monitored during noninvasive experiments. Parallel to our ongoing research, therefore, we are also working to develop methodologies that will permit us to study neural networks in the context of behavioral paradigms. We have already designed and implemented two high-field magnetic resonance imaging systems for functional, anatomical and spectroscopic imaging. The systems are endowed with all the necessary hard- and software to conduct simultaneous imaging and recordings, and they are being used to study the function, connectivity, and neurochemistry of the non-human primate brain. Furthermore, while continuing to exploit traditional neuroimaging in our experiments, we are also investigating the relationship of neural activity to the MR-measurable hemodynamic responses and experimenting with methods that do not rely on hemodynamic responses at all. In the context of the last-named project, a group of synthetic and coordination chemists in my laboratory are attempting to synthesize and evaluate MR-detectable smart probes that change magnetic properties as a function of the concentration of ions and molecules involved in neural signaling. Smart contrast agents, if designed and tested appropriately, promise to revolutionize invasive neuroimaging and would represent a quantum leap forward in signal-to-noise ratio, spatial detail and specificity, while affording unprecedented temporal resolution.Research in my laboratory concentrates on the neural mechanisms of perception and object recognition.

VI am a paleoanthropologist, my research interests are in study of human evolution and its environmental and cultural context. Our finds from site of Dmanisi from Eastern Georgia changed prevailing views about when humans first left Africa and who they were. We found trove of hominid fossils dating to 1.8 million years ago that document the first movements of hominids out of Africa, and demonstrate that this dispersal was due neither to increased brain size nor improved technology. Anatomy of the Dmanisi hominids has a surprising mosaic of primitive and derived features. The brains of Dmanisi people are intermediate in size between those of H. habilis and H. erectus. Their skeletons show that they had legs and feet adapted for long-distance walking and running similar to those of modern humans, but hands and arms were still more primitive. The Dmanisi hominin remains are the first discovered outside of Africa to show clear affinities to early Homo, they represent the missing link between Africa, Asia and Europe. We continue to study variability within an early Homo population and to reconstruct Late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene paleoecological conditions.I am a paleoanthropologist, my research interests are in study of human evolution and its environmental and cultural context.

VMy work has been an attempt to improve our understanding of human evolution using modern biological methods. While extraordinary cognition obviously sets us apart from other mammals, this singular adaptation is usually viewed as having occurred only recently, and relies almost entirely on brain size. It therefore fails to integrate other characters that may have interacted to selectively favor advanced cerebration. These potentially interacting factors include many highly specialized elements of diet, locomotion, reproductive biology, and social behavior that are unique to humans and our ancestors. What interrelationships among such characters might have interacted to encourage brain expansion? Explication requires examining the human fossil record from the perspectives of structural anatomy, evolutionary theory, developmental genetics, biomechanics, reproductive biology, and demography. When applied to pivotal human ancestral species such as Australopithecus afarensis and Ardipithecus ramidus, they suggest that a unique combination of key biological elements encouraged advanced cerebration to emerge much earlier than has previously been suspected. Cognition, rather than being merely a "natural" outcome of complex organic evolution in a hominoid primate, may instead be largely an historical accident derived from a singular array of non-neural traits emergent in our ancestors over deep time.My work has been an attempt to improve our understanding of human evolution using modern biological methods.

VMy research focuses on "soft" materials, such as liquid crystals, membranes, vesicles, Langmuir films, and the many realizations of such complex fluids as microemulsions. My approach is phenomenological: Properties of an equilibrium phase at length scales several times molecular lengths can be described by effective free energies and by hydrodynamical equations, which depend only on the conservation laws and the symmetry of the phase. Associated with each thermodynamic phase are elastic rigidities, low-frequency hydrodynamics modes, and topological defects that are collectively responsible for most of the remarkable properties of soft materials. Thermal fluctuations are almost by definition strong in soft systems, and they can lead to significant modifications of naive harmonics theories. In the recent past I have developed and applied these ideas to elucidate the properties of the twist-grain-boundary phase in liquid crystals, liquid crystalline emulsions, lamellar lipid phases intercalated with DNA, liquid crystalline elastomers, tethered membranes, and interacting arrays of one-dimensional Luttinger liquids. I have also worked on a variety of other problems, including the theoretical underpinnings of microrheology, flow of granular material under shear, and the origins of macroscopic chirality.My research focuses on "soft" materials, such as liquid crystals, membranes, vesicles, Langmuir films, and the many realizations of such complex fluids as microemulsions.

VMy interests span the field of evolutionary biology, with particular emphasis on the population-genetic mechanisms enabling or preventing various forms of evolutionary change. Although much of my earlier work focused on phenotypic evolution and quantitative genetics, we are currently taking advantage of genomic data to achieve a "bottom-up" approach to understanding evolution. A major theme underlying this research is the idea that many features of evolutionary change result from nonadaptive processes promoted by random genetic drift and mutation to mildly deleterious alleles. This work, which essentially serves as a null hypothesis for understanding adaptive evolution, has yielded insights into many aspects of genome and gene-structural evolution, including gene duplication, introns, gene modularity, regulation, and network architecture. Much of our work relies on the mathematical machinery of population genetics, but this emphasis is also closely tied to empirical work drawn from two model systems: the microcrustacean Daphnia, and the ciliated protozoan Paramecium. Using these and other organisms, we are currently obtaining the complete molecular spectrum of spontaneous mutations in an effort to define the scaling of this baseline evolutionary force across all of cellular life.My interests span the field of evolutionary biology, with particular emphasis on the population-genetic mechanisms enabling or preventing various forms of evolutionary change.

These integral membrane proteins mediate the passive flow of K+ ions across cell membranes, thereby generating the electrical signals produced by living cells. Specifically, I am studying two processes that are fundamental to ion channel function, ion selectivity, and gating. Using tools of molecular biology, electrophysiology, and X-ray crystallography, my laboratory has defined the molecular structure of the K+ channel pore and selectivity filter where K+ is distinguished from Na+. Ionic conductivity measurements and electron density data are being used to develop a picture of the ion conduction process.

VThe objectives of my research are to understand at the molecular level the mechanisms by which proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum catalyze the movement of calcium ions, thereby regulating muscle contraction and relaxation; how these calcium-cycling proteins are regulated through ligand binding and through protein-protein interactions; and how defects in genes encoding these proteins result in inherited muscle diseases. A specific goal is to gain insight into structure/function relationships in five sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins: the calcium pump (SERCA), responsible for terminating transient elevations of calcium in muscle cells, and two small proteins that interact with and regulate SERCA; phospholamban (PLN); and sarcolipin (SLN); the calcium release channel (RyR), which is responsible for creating transient elevations of sarcoplasmic calcium; and calsequestrin (CSQ), which stores calcium in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

VFor 25 years my research has focused on the structure and function of apolipoprotein (apo) E, specifically its critical role in cholesterol homeostasis and atherosclerosis and more recently in Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration. ApoE regulates the clearance of plasma lipoproteins by mediating their binding to lipoprotein receptors. My laboratory described apoE's ligand function, determined its protein and gene sequences, mapped the amino acid residues involved in receptor binding, defined the three-dimensional structure of the ligand-binding domain, and identified mutations that established its role in the pathogenesis of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Understanding the structure and function of apoE laid the groundwork for the recent explosion of studies concerning apoE4 and Alzheimer's disease. My laboratory was involved in describing the role of apoE in peripheral nerve regeneration, lipid transport in the nervous system, and cytoskeletal stability and neurite extension and remodeling. By establishing brain-specific apoE transgenic mice, we demonstrated detrimental effects on apoE4 on the central nervous system in vivo. I also direct an epidemiological study that has defined the major risk factor for heart disease in Turkey--genetically determined low levels of plasma high-density lipoproteins. The genetic nature of this disorder is under investigation.For 25 years my research has focused on the structure and function of apolipoprotein (apo) E, specifically its critical role in cholesterol homeostasis and atherosclerosis and more recently in Alzheimer's disease and neurodegeneration.

VMy laboratory is focused on understanding genetic and biochemical pathways that affect cell survival and apoptosis. We concentrate on two areas of intracellular signaling that are important for cell survival: signal transduction leading to the activation of the transcription factor NF kappa B and signal transduction that is affected by the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. To dissect these pathways and identify new genes in them we utilize multiple technologies, such as microarray gene profiling, genetic modifying screens, and expression cloning. Biochemical studies are also employed to confirm the identity of new genes and document relationships between known genes in these pathways. We generate mutant "knockout" mouse models to study the physiological roles of these novel genes. A recent success coming out of our analyses of the NF kappa B pathways as the identification of BCL10 as a gene involved in antigen-receptor-specific signaling leading to NF kappa B activation. We also recently demonstrated that the product of the DJ-1 gene might regulate PTEN mRNA and influence the function of this tumor-suppressive phosphatase. We hope that our findings will enrich the knowledge of these physiologically important pathways and allow the identification of mechanistic drug targets for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and malignancies.My laboratory is focused on understanding genetic and biochemical pathways that affect cell survival and apoptosis.

VMy research interest is in the mechanism of action of nuclear receptors, a family of ligand-dependent transcription factors. I have characterized the ligands and physiologic functions for a number of these receptors including LXRs, which bind oxysterols; FXR, which binds bile acids; and PPARs, which bind fatty acids. Recently, our lab discovered two new hormones, FGF15 and FGF21, that are down-stream targets of FXR and PPARalpha, respectively. Our study of these two nuclear receptor/FGF endocrine pathways has led to an understanding of how the body regulates nutrient metabolism during feeding and fasting. A second area of research in our laboratory has resulted in the identification of the hormonal ligands for the C. elegans nuclear receptor, DAF-12. This receptor governs the commitment of nematode worms to enter one of two developmental states: a long-lived, developmentally arrested state called dauer diapause, or, a progressive developmental state that results in maturation to reproductive adults. The discovery of DAF-12 ligands has broad implications for how nutrient availability can affect longevity and reproduction. Because of their involvement in a number of diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, and even parasitic infections, we are exploring the potential of these nuclear receptors as future therapeutic targets.My research interest is in the mechanism of action of nuclear receptors, a family of ligand-dependent transcription factors.

VI qualified in Physics in 1959 and went on to study for a PhD in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance at Queen Mary College, London University. I then married my wife Jean and we emigrated to the United States where I took up a position of Research Associate in Professor Charles Slichter's laboratory in Urbana, Illinois. There I studied NMR in metal alloys for 2 years after which time we decided to return to England. I was offered a position as Lecturer in Physics at the University of Nottingham which I accepted. On return to England I set up an NMR research group to study chemical shift interactions in solids using multi-pulse techniques that I had developed earlier during my PhD studies. Several years later in 1972 while thinking about further applications of multi-pulse techniques, I proposed initially a method of studying small structures using the multi-pulse technique. This quickly evolved into NMR imaging and was used to study small scale plant systems. It soon became apparent to me that the small scale imaging proposals could be extended too much larger objects and eventually to whole body scanning, ie magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).I qualified in Physics in 1959 and went on to study for a PhD in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance at Queen Mary College, London University.

VAs an experimentalist working in the area of condensed matter physics, I am interested in strongly correlated electron phenomena in novel d- and f-electron materials. These phenomena include superconductivity, magnetism, and effects that arise from their interplay, valence fluctuations, heavy fermion behavior, and non-Fermi liquid behavior.  I am especially interested in unconventional superconductivity that occurs in cuprates, which have superconducting critical temperatures (Tc) as high as ~ 130 K, and heavy fermion f-electron compounds, in which Tc ~ 1 K.  Heavy fermion f-electron compounds are based on rare earth or actinide ions with partially-filled f-electron shells (e.g., Ce, Yb, U) in which the conduction electrons have effective masses as large as several hundred times the free electron mass.  It is widely believed that the unconventional superconductivity found in these two classes of materials involves pairing of electrons in states with angular momentum greater than zero (p- or d-wave superconductivity), which is mediated by spin fluctuations.  Recently, superconductivity in the filled skutterudite compound PrOs4Sb12 (Tc = 1.85 K) was discovered in our laboratory at the University of California, San Diego.  This is the first heavy fermion superconductor based on Pr and may be the first example of superconducting electron pairing mediated by electric quadrupole fluctuations. There is also mounting evidence that PrOs4Sb12 exhibits triplet-spin (p-wave) superconductivity.  I also have a strong interest in non-Fermi liquid behavior and other exotic states, such as unconventional superconductivity, that are found in d- and f-electron materials in the vicinity of quantum critical points, values of a control parameter, such as composition, pressure, or magnetic field, where a second order phase transition is suppressed to 0 K (also referred to as quantum critical behavior).As an experimentalist working in the area of condensed matter physics, I am interested in strongly correlated electron phenomena in novel d- and f-electron materials.

My team is measuring the masses and orbits of other planets, with the goal of understanding the origin and architecture of planetary systems. We have learned that planets orbit at least 10 percent of all stars and that nature makes more small planets than large ones. The orbits are often not circular, defying our expectation based on the nearly circular orbits of the planets that orbit the Sun. We plan to learn whether our Solar System is a common or rare type of planetary system, and hence learn whether habitable planets are numerous in our Milky Way galaxy.My research involves the discovery of planets that orbit other stars.

VFor many years I have been using the small circuits of the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system as a platform with which to study how the dynamics of neuronal circuits depend on the interaction of their underlying synaptic connections and the intrinsic properties of their constitutent neurons. My early work was instrumental in demonstrating that neuronal circuits are not "hard-wired" but can be reconfigured by neuromodulatory neurons and substances to produce a variety of outputs. Together with Larry Abbott, my laboratory pioneered the "dynamic clamp". Our work today combines experimental and theoretical approaches to understand the homeostatic processes that maintain network stability while allowing for the flexibility needed for behavior. Additionally, we study the extent to which similar network performance can arise from different sets of underlying network parameters.For many years I have been using the small circuits of the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system as a platform with which to study how the dynamics of neuronal circuits depend on the interaction of their underlying synaptic connections and the intrinsic properties of their constitutent neurons.

I am mostly interested in problems that allow me to apply methods and results from different fields of mathematics. In my Ph.D. thesis I used methods from the theory of dynamical systems to the study of asymptotics of the number of closed geodesics on compact manifolds of negative curvature and to other geometric problems. Later I was able to use ergodic theory to prove structural results about discrete subgroups of Lie groups, in particular arithmeticity, superrigidity, and the finiteness of nontrivial quotients.  More recently I have been involved in applications of homogeneous dynamics to number theory and diophantine approximation. In particular, using homogeneous dynamics and partially in collaboration with other mathematicians, I was able to prove some conjectures about values of irrational quadratic forms and about diophantine approximation on manifolds.As a mathematician I work in several fields: dynamical systems, Lie groups and their discrete subgroups, algebraic and arithmetic groups, number theory, and combinatorics.

VUsing chemical approaches to probe biological function is the central focus of the laboratory. A specific emphasis has been on the study of protein function and enzyme reaction mechanisms. Initial experiments carried out in the early 1980's on a novel pathway involving mammalian biosynthesis of nitrate have led to a sustained effort in nitric oxide (NO) signaling with a focus on the mechanism of nitric oxide synthase and the target enzyme for NO, the soluble isoform of guanylate cyclase. The discovery of prokaryotic NO and oxygen sensors that are related to guanylate cyclase have recently led to a general molecular understanding of gas sensing mechanisms in biology. The signaling pathways in these prokaryotes are under current study with a focus on structure and function relationships and in vivo function. Eukaryotic studies have been expanded to S-nitrosation chemistry involved in non-cGMP-dependent NO signaling where the search for and study of proteins that would impart specificity to the promiscuous solution reactivity are being sought. Our finding of a specific transnitrosation reaction between thioredoxin and caspase-3 is being studied further and expanded to other proteins. Other investigations underway include metal sensing in biology and heme metabolism and protein trafficking in Plasmodium falciparum.Using chemical approaches to probe biological function is the central focus of the laboratory.

VMy research is spread from clinical to basic aspects of the ulcer causing stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori. This organism still infects about half the world's population in a process that is mildly pathogenic. In people with gastric diseases such as peptic ulcer, the bacterium is still quite difficult to eradicate because 10% of organisms develop antibiotic resistance. Therefore there is continuous refinement needed for antibiotic treatments. In the basic and immunology area, I believe the Helicobacter controls the immune system of the gastric mucosa so that, in most persons, the inflammation is not sufficient to cause ulcers, but neither is it able to eradicate the bacterium. Thus infection is life-long. Therefore, Helicobacter might be a useful platform for delivering vaccines in a safe and cost effective manner, as a "super probiotic"; a live genetically modified agent which immunizes through the gastric wall. I have started a biotech company called Ondek which is building an orally administered flu vaccine.My research is spread from clinical to basic aspects of the ulcer causing stomach bacterium Helicobacter pylori.

VI am interested in understanding how outgrowth and patterning of organ primordia are regulated in the vertebrate embryo. By conducting gain-of-function experiments in the chicken embryo and loss-of-function studies in the mouse embryo, my colleagues and I have shown that members of the fibroblast-growth-factor (FGF) family play a central role in this process, particularly in limb and early brain development. We are currently trying to determine which molecular and cellular processes are disrupted when FGFs, as well as other essential secreted signaling molecules, are absent during organogenesis.I am interested in understanding how outgrowth and patterning of organ primordia are regulated in the vertebrate embryo.

VMy research program is devoted to defining the mechanism of Transforming Growth Factors beta (TGF-beta) and the basis for the specificity of its effects on the cell. TGF-beta and related factors, activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), are pivotal regulators of many cell functions during embryogenesis and in the adult. The integrity of this signaling network is essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis, and its disruption by mutation underlies several human inherited disorders, cancer, and other diseases. TGF-beta factors are widely multifunctional, eliciting different responses depending on the cell type and cellular context. Work over the past decade has delineated a TGF-beta signal transduction pathway from the membrane to the nucleus. This pathway involves the assembly of two protein complexes that act in sequence: a ligand-driven membrane receptor complex that activates Smad proteins and a Smad-driven transcription complex that activates specific target genes. The ultimate goal is to apply this knowledge to the treatment of disease conditions that derive from alterations in these pathways.My research program is devoted to defining the mechanism of Transforming Growth Factors beta (TGF-beta) and the basis for the specificity of its effects on the cell.

VOur lab works in the fields of T cell differentiation and autoimmunity, with a special emphasis on exploiting the most advanced transgenic and gene-targeting technology to engineer new mouse models. Studies on T cell differentiation focus on 1) selection of the T cell repertoire, in particular the mechanisms of positive and negative selection and lineage commitment; and 2) cellular and molecular influences on memory T cell survival in the periphery. Studies on autoimmunity explore the immunological mechanisms of diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and APECED, a polyglandular autoimmune disease. Major questions tackled are what initiates these diseases, how is their progression regulated, and what are the final effector mechanisms. In addition, modern genetic and genomic approaches are used to identify disease-modifying genes in both human patients and mouse models, and the application of computational and bioinformatic strategies to these and other issues is beginning to be explored.Our lab works in the fields of T cell differentiation and autoimmunity, with a special emphasis on exploiting the most advanced transgenic and gene-targeting technology to engineer new mouse models.

VMy major research interest is the roles of vitamin-derived cofactors in the catalysis of complex chemical reactions. My laboratory has concentrated on cofactors derived from vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and folic acid, which are involved in cellular one-carbon metabolism. Cobalamin plays an important role in one carbon metabolism by accepting a methyl group from a derivative of folic acid, methyltetrahydrofolate, and delivering it to homocysteine to form methionine. Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine are linked to increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and to development of neural tube defects in the fetus. We have studied enzymes involved in homocysteine remethylation that employ cobalamin- and folate-based cofactors to gain insights into the chemistry of the transformations, as well as to delineate the molecular consequences of genetic variations that are known to lead to elevated levels of plasma homocyseine when folate levels are low. In addition, we are interested in the factors that govern the conformation changes necessary for alternate exposure of methyltetrahydrofolate and homocysteine to the cobalamin cofactor during the synthesis of methionine. We are exploring how substrate and product binding and the changing methylation state of the cobalamin bias the kinetics and thermodynamics governing interconversion of conformational states of the enzyme.My major research interest is the roles of vitamin-derived cofactors in the catalysis of complex chemical reactions.

VAs an astrophysicist, I work on developing and expanding a new technique called "adaptive optics." The spatial resolution of images taken by ground-based telescopes is strongly limited by turbulence in the earth's atmosphere. Adaptive optics (AO) measures the atmospheric turbulence above a telescope hundreds of times a second, and uses this information to reshape a special "deformable mirror" that removes the optical aberrations caused by the turbulence. The result is a factor of 10 to 20 improvement in spatial resolution on today's largest 8-10m ground-based telescopes, which with AO at infrared wavelengths can perform at their diffraction limit. To measure the turbulence for a larger fraction of places in the sky, I led the development of the first "laser guide stars" at Lick and Keck Observatories based on excitation of the D2 line of atomic sodium at an altitude of about 100 km. I am currently the Project Scientist for Keck Observatory's Next Generation AO system, which will yield image improvement at shorter wavelengths and over a larger area. I am using today's AO systems to study the mergers of nearby colliding galaxies, and to measure the masses of the super-massive black holes that reside in their cores.As an astrophysicist, I work on developing and expanding a new technique called "adaptive optics."

VMy research is based on the premise that it is useful to view human cognition as emerging from the parallel, distributed processing activity of neural populations. Over the years my colleagues and I have applied these ideas to a wide range of topics in human cognition, perception, language processing, and memory, with additional applications to topics in perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic development. In work on context effects in perception we developed an explicit model in which perception reflects an interactive activation process, involving synergistic, joint use of bottom-up or sensory information together with top-down or contextual information. In work on the human ability to apply familiar and regular patterns to novel examples (e.g., to infer that the past tense of a new verb "glub" is "glubbed") we argued that such abilities can arise in networks of simple neuron-like processing units without the need to formulate explicit rules to capture the pattern. Other work explores the implications of our parallel distributed processing approach for the organization of learning and memory in the brain, for basic aspects of human information processing and attention, and for the causes of the patterns of change seen over time during cognitive development.My research is based on the premise that it is useful to view human cognition as emerging from the parallel, distributed processing activity of neural populations.

VAnn McDermott's research group studies the mechanisms of several enzymes, principally through solid-state NMR spectroscopy. She has studied the opening of the active site flexible loop of the glycolytic enzyme, Triosephosphate isomerase,  and its coupling to the appearance of product, using a range of biophysical probes. The compressed "non-bonded" interactions of the pre-reactive substrate on the active site of this enzyme, and the conformational dynamics, have been experimentally probed at high resolution. Analogous studies are underway for bacterial Cytochrome P450, where conformational flexibility impacts the range of chemistry carried out by the enzyme. These studies involve recent advances in high-resolution solid-state NMR spectra of uniformly or selectively isotopically enriched proteins wherein site-specific assignments allow for efficient structural, dynamic and mechanistic studies. She also studies the photosynthetic reaction center, and demonstrated for the first time a coherent, quantum mechanical photochemical mechanism for enhancement of NMR detection sensitivity by three orders of magnitude involving the primary players of electron transfer.Ann McDermott's research group studies the mechanisms of several enzymes, principally through solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

These studies involve recent advances in high-resolution solid-state NMR spectra of uniformly or selectively isotopically enriched proteins wherein site-specific assignments allow for efficient structural, dynamic and mechanistic studies. She also studies the photosynthetic reaction center, and demonstrated for the first time a coherent, quantum mechanical photochemical mechanism for enhancement of NMR detection sensitivity by three orders of magnitude involving the primary players of electron transfer.

VI am a multidisciplinary applied mathematician. Throughout my career I have focused on the use of mathematics in the sciences and the development of mathematics for the sciences. Modern applied mathematics includes scientific computation and numerical analysis, mathematical modeling, formal asymptotics, mathematical analysis, and direct work with experimental and observational data. I believe that applied mathematics, taken in this broadest sense, is intensely needed throughout modern science.  The general area of my research is large-scale nonlinear systems - nonlinear systems whose temporal evolution is frequently described by partial differential equations. My own work provides qualitative descriptions of the temporal (regular or chaotic) behavior of specific nonlinear systems that govern idealized representations of nonlinear waves, laser beams, and most recently neuronal networks for visual neural science. In each case these are complex nonlinear systems for fields that are extended in space, and in the case of the visual cortex, composed of competing species with extensive coupling and feedback. For that system I have participated in the development of a large-scale computational model of the "front end" of the cortical visual system (the primary visual cortex) focusing upon local properties of individual cells within the large-scale network.I am a multidisciplinary applied mathematician.

VMy research focuses on the interaction between complex analysis, geometry, dynamics and low-dimensional topology. A central idea is that the tension between the flexibility of 2-dimensional objects and the rigidity of higher-dimensional objects is mediated by fixed-point phenomena on moduli spaces. This theme has ramifications ranging from the theory of renormalization (self-organizing critical structures) to the geometrization of 3-manifolds (curved tilings associated to knots). Recently connections with algebra and number theory have also emerged, leading to new examples of polygons with optimal billiard dynamics, new constructions of surfaces with many symmetries, and new calculations in string theory.My research focuses on the interaction between complex analysis, geometry, dynamics and low-dimensional topology.

VI am principally interested in the physical processes shaping the surfaces of the terrestrial planets (including the Earth), and in the origin and evolution of the planetary system.  One of my major concerns is the process of impact cratering.  I also maintain an active research program focused on terrestrial and planetary tectonics and the physics of very large landslides.  I am very much attracted by apparent paradoxes, situations where observation and theory seem to be in conflict.  Thus, the discovery that the SNC meteorites had been launched from the surface of Mars, in apparent conflict with the best impact cratering theories at the time, was an obvious area needing clarification.  In another apparent paradox, very large landslides and collapsing impact craters exhibit a surprisingly high mobility that cannot be explained by current ideas on rock friction.  I proposed a mechanism, acoustic fluidization, which successfully explains the long runout of "Sturzstrom" landslides and the form of collapsed impact craters on the Earth and other planets.  This mechanism may also explain the now-incontrovertible evidence for very low coefficients of friction along such faults as the San Andreas in California.  Continuing work on this process includes both laboratory experiments and theoretical modeling.I am principally interested in the physical processes shaping the surfaces of the terrestrial planets (including the Earth), and in the origin and evolution of the planetary system.

VAn archaeologist, my research interests primarily center on the origins, antiquity, and adaptations of the first Americans (Paleoindians), who colonized North America at the end of the Pleistocene (Ice Age). I seek to understand how these hunter-gatherers met the challenges of moving across and adapting to the vast, initially unknown, ecologically diverse landscape of Late Glacial North America, during a time of significant climate change. That interest has involved investigations into the processes of landscape learning, the demographics of colonization, the possible role of Paleoindian groups in Late Pleistocene mammalian extinctions, the effects of climate change on early Paleoindian foragers, and the adaptive mechanisms that enabled initial colonizers to disperse rapidly across the continent. These research interests have been pursued through archaeological fieldwork in many areas of North America, from arctic Alaska to the southern High Plains, and most recently in the exploration of high elevation sites of Late Pleistocene age on the western slope of the Rockies. Much of this research has involved collaboration with geologists, palynologists and vertebrate paleontologists, in order to develop a finer-grained record of the climatic and ecological changes that would have directly impacted human foragers.An archaeologist, my research interests primarily center on the origins, antiquity, and adaptations of the first Americans (Paleoindians), who colonized North America at the end of the Pleistocene (Ice Age).

VMy laboratory explores the mechanisms by which small quantitative differences in molecular signals are translated into alternative developmental fates and the means by which genetic regulatory hierarchies control developmental decisions. In numerous organisms the decision to become male or female is made by an X-chromosome counting mechanism that reliably distinguishes one X chromosome from two. We have dissected such a precise chromosome counting mechanism in molecular detail in the nematode C. elegans. The number of X chromosomes is communicated by a set of X-linked signal elements that promote female development by repressing a male-inducing sex-determination switch gene via two distinct, dose-dependent molecular mechanisms. Organisms that use X-chromosome-based strategies to determine sex must evolve mechanisms to ensure that males and females express equal levels of X-chromosome products. We have shown that X-chromosome gene dosage is compensated by a specialized protein complex that assembles on both X chromosomes of females to repress transcription by half. The complex includes conserved components of mitotic and meiotic machinery, indicating a mechanistic link between X-chromosome-wide gene expression, higher-order chromatin structure, and chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Recruitment of chromosome segregation proteins to the new task of regulating X-chromosome gene expression points to the evolutionary origin of nematode dosage compensation.My laboratory explores the mechanisms by which small quantitative differences in molecular signals are translated into alternative developmental fates and the means by which genetic regulatory hierarchies control developmental decisions.

Recruitment of chromosome segregation proteins to the new task of regulating X-chromosome gene expression points to the evolutionary origin of nematode dosage compensation.

VMy research in mathematical psychology and cognitive science has focused on various fundamental aspects of human perception, attention, memory, language, thought, cognitive control, and action.  During the early part of my career, I studied how people organize and retrieve information about concepts and meanings of words stored in long-term semantic memory.  By measuring people's reaction times to recognize semantically related words, my experiments revealed and analyzed processes of automatic "spreading activation" whereby word meanings are accessed in mental networks of concepts.  Subsequently, I have developed new general methods for investigating the quantitative temporal properties of mental information-processing stages under a broad range of conditions through examining probability distributions of reaction times.  I have also created mathematical models to characterize the speed and accuracy of rapid aimed limb movements in terms of optimization processes that compensate for stochastic neuro-motor "noise".  Integrating these various lines of investigation, my most recent research - conducted in collaboration with computer-science colleagues - has formulated a unified computational theory of cognition and applied it to account for numerous phenomena observed in human multi-tasking.  A key objective of this theory is to explain and predict strategies that people use for task scheduling as a function of the types of task to be performed.My research in mathematical psychology and cognitive science has focused on various fundamental aspects of human perception, attention, memory, language, thought, cognitive control, and action.

VWorking as an economist, I study the ways in which limited resources are allocated by markets, governments and the internal processes of firms. For market processes, I study auctions and how they can be improved. The simultaneous multiple round auction, which I invented with my colleagues Robert Wilson and Preston McAfee, enables a more rational allocation of multiple items by enabling bidders to substitute among licenses based on the demand information that emerges during the course of the process. This performance of this design, which is now used around the world for the allocation of radio spectrum licenses, deteriorates when goods may sometimes be complements instead of substitutes. This may potentially be solved by a new combinatorial auction design, which I am developing in my current research. For organizations, I have studied how incentives for some tasks can unexpectedly affect the performance of others by causing people to divert resources and how improved communications that coordinate some activities sometimes also create new opportunities for people to influence unrelated decisions, leading to a waste of resources. I have also studied the emergence of private law and how restraints on medieval princes led to improved efficiency of trade.Working as an economist, I study the ways in which limited resources are allocated by markets, governments and the internal processes of firms.

VThroughout my research career, I've been engaged with the mechanisms by which ion channel proteins work. These proteins, which form aqueous pores spanning the membranes of all cells, provide ionic "leak" pathways that are gated by a huge variety of biological signals - neurotransmitters, transmembrane voltage, heat, cold, Ca++, phosphorylation, membrane "stretch," G-proteins, to name a few.  Channels are good inorganic chemists that exquisitely distinguish among similar "structureless" ions, allowing K+, for instance, to pass while excluding Na+, or welcoming Ca++ while rejecting Mg++.  Early on, I developed a method for examining the action of single ion channel molecules in biochemically defined "artificial" membranes by high-resolution electrical recording and have exploited this technique, as well as other single-molecule methods, to infer mechanisms of channel gating and ion selection for various channel yes.  Recently, I have been focusing on Cl- channels, supplementing these purely functional approaches with x-ray crystallographic analysis.  These investigations have led me to follow up a recent unexpected finding - that a class of proteins long thought to be Cl- channels are in fact energy-requiring Cl- "pumps" - and accordingly I've been dragged into the unfamiliar territory of sorting out mechanisms of ion transport that are far more intricate than simple "leaks" through an aqueous pore.Throughout my research career, I've been engaged with the mechanisms by which ion channel proteins work.

VAs a physicist, I have explored how we could use optics and optoelectronics to help with information processing. I have tried to discover key pieces of physics that would enable such use of optics, clarifying both the limits and the opportunities. We need particularly strong physical mechanisms to allow optical devices with low enough operating energies. To that end, I studied optical and optoelectronic mechanisms in semiconductors and in nanostructures. One particularly strong mechanism, the quantum-confined Stark effect, which we observed in thin quantum-well semiconductor layers, gives very large changes in optical absorption with applied voltages; it is used extensively in high-speed optical modulators in telecommunications, and is now being explored for communicating inside computers. The physical reasons for using light beams to replace wires at the shorter lengths and higher densities inside computers are quite different those for the longer telecommunications distances; I have examined these physical reasons, clarifying the benefits that flow from the different physics of electronics and optics, including the mechanism of quantum impedance conversion that may allow substantial savings in energy. I have also recently proved basic physical limits to the performance of optical components that will hopefully guide our use of the new opportunities in optics fabricated in nanoscale structures.As a physicist, I have explored how we could use optics and optoelectronics to help with information processing.

VThe classic paradigm in psychology assumed that the stability of personality is expressed in the individual's consistent personality-relevant behavior across diverse situations. My work caused a paradigm shift, showing that individual differences in social behaviors are surprisingly variable across different situations, and that the belief in consistency was contradicted by the objective research evidence. To solve this paradox, I showed with Y. Shoda that genuine consistency exists, but it is found in stable, distinctive behavioral "signatures" of cross-situational variability (e.g., he does X when A but Y when B), rather than constancy, and we constructed models that can account for these characteristic person-situation interactions.  In longitudinal work over three decades on the development of individual differences in delay of gratification, I also found that the ability of very young children to delay immediate gratification for larger but later rewards predicts outcomes from criminality to SAT scores, and in a series of experimental studies identified cognitive-attention control mechanisms that underlie this ability and enable self-control. Collectively, this work has had significant implications not only for the field of personality and the allied areas of clinical, social, and developmental psychology, but also for cognitive anthropology, behavioral economics, behavioral medicine, philosophy, and law.The classic paradigm in psychology assumed that the stability of personality is expressed in the individual's consistent personality-relevant behavior across diverse situations.

VW. E. Moerner's research has spanned the areas of spectral hole-burning for optical storage, mechanisms of photorefractivity in organic materials, single-molecule spectroscopy and microscopy in polymeric and biophysical systems, and photonic properties of nanoscale metallic antennas. His group is perhaps best known as being the first to optically detect and measure the spectrum of a single molecule in the condensed phase in 1989. The low-temperature, high-resolution single-molecule spectroscopy of the early 1990's evolved into room temperature biomolecular studies in the late 1990's, and his group was the first to detect and characterize blinking and photoswitching effects for single copies of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as well as Forster resonant energy transfer between two GFP emitters. Other biophysical problems of interest have included the orientational behavior of single kinesin motors, diffusion in the plasma membrane, and observation of the directed motion of single proteins in a living cell to determine the subwavelength shape of cellular structures. Professor Moerner's current efforts include development of new single-molecule fluorophores for cellular imaging beyond the diffraction limit, exploration of biological chaperonins as they assist protein folding, and novel trapping devices capable of overcoming Brownian motion to allow extended study of single biomolecules in solution.W.

VMy main field of research has been dynamo theory, i.e. the theory of the spontaneous generation of magnetic fields in conducting fluids, with application to the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of planets, stars and galaxies.  This has involved the study of MHD turbulence, the subject of my PhD thesis (1962), and the associated development of 'mean field electrodynamics' involving the 'helicity' of a turbulent flow. My own interests increasingly involved the topological aspects of MHD, and analogous topological aspects of vortex dynamics governed by the Euler equations of fluid dynamics.  I have also made contributions to Stokes flow of viscous fluids, especially involving corner flows for which I described the universal sequence of eddies that can occur in the neighbourhood of any sharp corner (of angle less than about 147 degrees). With Konrad Bajer, I found the first example of a Stokes flow in a bounded region exhibiting chaos, important for the mixing of any transported scalar. I have also studied free surface effects, and found (with J.T.Jeong) an exact solution of the Stokes equations describing the 'cusp singularity' that forms at quite modest values of the capillary number in any region of free-surface convergence, a generic phenomenon of great importance in relation to the detailed mechanism whereby one fluid can mix into another.

VDuring fasting, pancreatic glucagon promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis through induction of the second messenger cAMP. Our laboratory characterized the CREB protein and showed that it stimulates gene expression following its phosphorylation in response to fasting signals. Now recognized as a predominant regulatory mechanism, CREB provided the first example of a transcription factor whose activity is modulated by phosphorylation. CREB is phosphorylated by a wide range of extracellular signals; recent studies indicate that a second family of CREB cofactors, called CRTCs, mediate target gene expression selectively in response to cAMP and calcium signals.  One of these, CRTC2, triggers the gluconeogenic program in liver during fasting, when it undergoes de-phosphorylation and binds to CREB over relevant genes. Current studies focus on the mechanism by which different CRTCs contribute to energy balance by modulating CREB activity in other insulin sensitive tissues.During fasting, pancreatic glucagon promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis through induction of the second messenger cAMP.

VMy long-term interests are in the evolution of biological complexity, such as that apparent in complex life histories, in intimate interactions among species and in species-diversity of clades and communities. My focus is on symbiosis, particularly that between multicellular hosts and microbes. Symbioses are central in the evolution of complexity; have evolved many times and are critical to the lifestyles of many animals and plants and also to whole ecosystems, in which symbiotic organisms are key players. The primary reason that symbiosis research is suddenly active, after decades at the margins of mainstream biology, is that DNA technology and genomics give us enormous new ability to discover symbiont diversity, and more significantly, to reveal how microbial metabolic capabilities contribute to the functioning of hosts and biological communities. My ongoing projects, mostly collaborations with students and postdoctoral associates, include phylogenetic and genomic studies of previously unstudied insect symbioses, experiments on gene expression of symbionts within hosts, computational reconstruction of the content and arrangement of genes in bacterial ancestors, and experimental investigations of facultative symbioses that are heritable but more labile within host lineages.My long-term interests are in the evolution of biological complexity, such as that apparent in complex life histories, in intimate interactions among species and in species-diversity of clades and communities.

My ongoing projects, mostly collaborations with students and postdoctoral associates, include phylogenetic and genomic studies of previously unstudied insect symbioses, experiments on gene expression of symbionts within hosts, computational reconstruction of the content and arrangement of genes in bacterial ancestors, and experimental investigations of facultative symbioses that are heritable but more labile within host lineages.My long-term interests are in the evolution of biological complexity, such as that apparent in complex life histories, in intimate interactions among species and in species-diversity of clades and communities.

VMy research addresses problems in science, technology and public policy. Much of my work has involved the development and demonstration of methods to characterize and treat uncertainty in quantitative policy analysis. With Max Henrion I am the author of Uncertainty: A guide to dealing with uncertainty in quantitative risk and policy analysis (Cambridge, 1990). I have addressed a variety of problems in risk assessment (e.g. possible risks from consumer electronics carried on commercial airliners), risk management and risk communication. With Baruch Fischhoff, Ann Bostrom and Cynthia Atman I am the author of Risk Communication: A mental models approach (Cambridge, 2002). For more than a decade I have worked on problems in climate policy, climate change impact assessment, and climate-related to decision-making. I also work on problems in energy technology and policy, focusing in particular on the electricity industry, including strategies and regulations to increase efficiency and limit the emissions of carbon dioxide.My research addresses problems in science, technology and public policy.

VI study human evolution in the Andean Cordillera and its Pacific coastal desert. My transdisciplinary research engages the 11,000-year record of maritime adaptations to the near-shore fishery; the 4,000-year performance of arid-land agricultural adaptations encoded in abandoned planting surfaces, fields, terraces, and canals of different ages; and the Quaternary geoarchaeological record of climate and tectonism, including recurrent El Nino perturbations, protracted droughts, above-normal rainfalls and runoff, volcanic eruptions, large-magnitude earthquakes, and tectonic creep. By integrating millennial scale documentation of environmental variability and stress with productivity fluctuations in fishing and farming and consequent changes in demographic distributions and densities, I seek to expand understanding of the development of human organization from early foraging societies through the rise and demise of states and nations.

VAs an atmospheric scientist and paleoclimatologist my interests focus on reconstructing Earth's climate history using the chemical constituents and physical properties preserved in its glaciers and ice sheets. I am the Co-Founder of Ohio State's Ice Core Paleoclimate Research Group that has collected ice cores in both Polar Regions and from the highest mountain glaciers with the goal of extracting highly resolved (annual to decadal scale) proxy climate histories. We have emphasized the last two thousand years, the period most relevant to modern human activities. These proxy histories provide a critical backdrop against which the recent warming of the Earth System can be assessed. Our cores from low latitude, high elevation ice fields point to the last 50 years as the warmest in the last two millennia. Our high resolution ice core histories provide evidence for past abrupt climate changes on both regional and near-global scales and help illuminate potential drivers. My team members are particularly interested in quantifying the magnitude and rate of climate changes (e.g., temperature and precipitation) to which human systems are highly vulnerable.As an atmospheric scientist and paleoclimatologist my interests focus on reconstructing Earth's climate history using the chemical constituents and physical properties preserved in its glaciers and ice sheets.

VI am interested in the way the brain encodes visual information, and in the mechanisms that put that information to use in the control of behavior. I study the function and development of the visual system, especially the visual areas of the cerebral cortex, with a particular focus on the processing of signals about the motion and form of objects. I work mostly as a neurophysiologist recording the activity of single neurons, but much of my research draws on related areas of visual psychophysics, and on computational approaches to understanding brain organization and visual processing. I also study the functional development of the cortical visual system, and the way development is affected by early visual experience. Much of my work has sought to uncover the links between brain and behavior by studying the relationship between neuronal activity in the visual system and its perceptual and motor consequences. More recently, I have become interested in using theory and experiment to ask how information can be extracted from the activity of neuronal populations and used to support perceptual decisions and visually-guided action.I am interested in the way the brain encodes visual information, and in the mechanisms that put that information to use in the control of behavior.

VMy research area is "synthetic organic chemistry" and in particular, "exploration of new synthetic reactions". For example: to let the dehydration-condensation reaction between two organic molecules proceed under neutral conditions, we eliminated H2O in [2H] and [O] whereas its conventionally accepted form was in [H] and [OH]. While Lewis acid-catalyzed reactions between carbonyl compounds and enolates were considered highly selective and practical, we attempted Lewis base-catalyzed reactions. This turned out to greatly broaden its application potential. Our conception of using stable 1-fluorosugar in glycosylation reaction cleared long outstanding problems such as its drastic reaction conditions. My other study interests involve: (i) the chemistry of TiCl4 and the onium salts of azzromatics; (ii) aldol reaction using Sn(Otf)2 as Lewis acid; (iii) asymmetric reaction using Sn(Otf)2-chiral diamine complex; and (iv) the total synthesis of natural products such as Taxol.My research area is "synthetic organic chemistry" and in particular, "exploration of new synthetic reactions".

VI have worked mainly on the dynamics of interacting populations of predator and prey, most recently on California red scale, a worldwide pest of citrus crops and its spectacularly successful biological control organism, an insect parasitoid. Since virtually all species are either eaten by or eat others, or both, the consumer-resource interaction is the central one in ecological communities. Most interactions result in stable populations, whose abundances change relatively little through time, while others are unstable: their populations cycle in abundance, or may even go extinct, at least locally. My colleagues and I have combined experiments in the field and mathematical models to explain a range of particular dynamical interactions, and have used mathematical theory to establish general explanations for these dynamic patterns. Most recently I have been working on applying return-on-investment approaches to conservation.I have worked mainly on the dynamics of interacting populations of predator and prey, most recently on California red scale, a worldwide pest of citrus crops and its spectacularly successful biological control organism, an insect parasitoid.

VThe thrust of our research group is in optical science and technology. We develop new coherent, femtosecond laser and x-ray sources for use in many applications in physics, chemistry, materials science and engineering. Much of our effort involves generating and using "laser-like" beams at wavelengths 10-1000 times shorter than visible light, in the extreme ultraviolet and soft-x-ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. These wavelengths are well matched to the primary atomic resonances of most elements, making possible many element- and chemically- specific spectroscopies and spectromicroscopies, ultrafast spectroscopies, as well as nano-imaging.The thrust of our research group is in optical science and technology.

During the past decade, as laser technology has progressed to the point where light pulses can be manipulated on a cycle-by-cycle basis, this topic of "coherent control" of atoms and molecules has drawn increasing interest. In recent work, we have taken this concept to the extreme. By manipulating a light pulse on the fastest possible time-scale relevant to atomic and molecular processes-that corresponding to less than a single undulation of the electromagnetic field of the light that interacts with an atom-we have manipulated atomic and molecular quantum wave functions for useful outcomes. For example, by optimizing the wavefunction of an ionizing electron on angstrom scalelengths and on attosecond timescales, we can selectively optimize coherent x-ray generation.We are also pursuing research that is now a major theme in atomic and molecular science: given that we understand the basics of how atoms and molecules work, can we manipulate and control them in useful ways?

VI was part of a generation of economic theorists who worked to bring game theory into economic analysis. My early work focused on general game-theoretic methodology, including refinements of the Nash equilibrium concept. I studied communication in games where individuals have different information, developing concepts of incentive-compatibility and the revelation principle. These methods can be used to characterize efficient coordination mechanisms subject to incentive constraints, which represent people's need for appropriate incentives to share private information or to exert hidden efforts.I was part of a generation of economic theorists who worked to bring game theory into economic analysis.

VOne part of my research deals with how a fluid loses its ability to flow. This can happen, for example, to a supercooled liquid as the temperature is lowered so that it becomes increasingly sluggish and forms a glass. It can also happen in a granular fluid when it becomes jammed. I have been searching for common aspects that relate these transitions between flowing and dynamically arrested states. Another area of interest has to do with exploring the nature of the singularities that occur in the interfaces of fluids. A drop falling from a faucet is a common example of a liquid fissioning into two or more pieces. The cascade of structure that is produced in this process is of uncommon beauty. As the drop falls, a long neck, connecting two masses of fluid, stretches out and then breaks. What is the shape of the drop at the instant of breaking apart? Something dire must happen to the mathematical description of the liquid at that point since the drop is changing from a single entity into two disconnected pieces. Exploring the nature of the singularities in this situation is relevant for understanding singularities in many other dynamical contexts.One part of my research deals with how a fluid loses its ability to flow.

VMy primary interest as a marine microbiologist has been to understand the two life styles of an epidemic-causing diarrhea pathogen Vibrio cholerae in its host environment as a pathogen and in its free-living state in the aquatic environment. This rather unconventional approach has enabled me to study another important process that relates to the emergence of new variants of this organism that has been induced by selective pressures in the environment as well as in the host. Following this approach has allowed my colleagues and I to discover the evolution of new variants of enteric pathogens in an endemic setting, the most famous of which was the discovery of the new serogroup that causes cholera, namely, Vibrio cholerae O139 Bengal. We were also associated with the discovery of the new pandemic serogroup Vibrio parahaemolyticus and many new variants of Shiga-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). I have begun dabbling with the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which has a nonepidemic mode of transmission in contrast with that of Vibrio cholerae. Understanding the evolution of bacterial pathogens that have two entirely different modes of transmission will provide new insights into how these pathogens outwit their human hosts.My primary interest as a marine microbiologist has been to understand the two life styles of an epidemic-causing diarrhea pathogen Vibrio cholerae in its host environment as a pathogen and in its free-living state in the aquatic environment.

VIntercellular communication mediated by neurotransmitters and their receptors in the neural network is a fundamental process responsible for brain function. My laboratory has studied molecular mechanisms and function of excitatory glutamate-synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. We elucidated the molecular nature of N-methyl-D-aspartate and metabotropic types of glutamate receptors by molecular cloning. On the basis of our finding of a molecular diversity of glutamate receptors, we have extended our study to glutamate receptor-mediated sensory processing mechanisms in the visual and olfactory systems. We have also been investigating synaptic plasticity responsible for olfactory and hippocampal memory formation and cerebellar motor coordination. More recently, we have been addressing how synaptic transmission is integrated and modulated in the neural circuit. In combination with cell-ablating techniques with transgenic mice we succeeded in eliminating specific neuronal cells within a particular neural circuit and have been investigating physiological and behavioral roles of synaptic integration in the neural network. In doing this we have focused on the neural circuits in the retina, cerebellum, and basal ganglia and have pursued synaptic integration in these networks, using several approaches, including molecular biology, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis.Intercellular communication mediated by neurotransmitters and their receptors in the neural network is a fundamental process responsible for brain function.

VMy basic scientific interest has been in fluid dynamics, chiefly aerospace and atmospheric. One study has concerned the transition zone in the boundary layer as flow goes from laminar to turbulent, a modeling problem that is of particular interest to the gas turbine industry. My colleagues and I have also made extensive studies of the reverse process of relaminarization. In recent years I have been working on more complete theories of the flow instabilities that precede transition to turbulent flow; this has led to other studies connected with flow control, both passive and active. I have also worked in gas dynamics (e.g., using group theoretic methods for analyzing strong shock waves). An atmospheric problem of interest has been the nocturnal temperature distribution near ground, which is full of surprises because of strong interactions between radiation, conduction, and turbulent transport. With a combination of experimental and computational studies my colleagues and I have investigated the strange entrainment characteristics of cloud-like flows. Other than fluid dynamics I have studied the non-linear motion of an elastic string, and constructed a theory of stochastic corrective processes for analyzing performance variations in a complex system.  One area of interest in atmospheric problems has been the nocturnal temperature distribution near ground, which is full of surprises because of strong interactions between radiation, conduction, and turbulent transport.

VMy research focuses on the study of the cell-cell interactions required for plant reproduction.  By studying the highly specific interactions between the pollen or pollen tube and the female pistil, we expect to understand the mechanisms underlying reproductive success and mating specificity within and between species, and to shed light on the more general problem of cell-cell communication in plants.   A long-standing interest has been to investigate the mechanism of self-incompatibility in crucifers, a major barrier to self-fertilization that leads to the arrest of self-related pollen grains at the surface of the pistil.   We showed that recognition of self-pollen results from allele-specific interactions between a receptor kinase expressed on the epidermal cells of the pistil and its ligand, a small peptide expressed on the surface of pollen grains. By transformation with a pair of receptor and ligand genes, we rendered the self-fertile species A. thaliana self-incompatible, thus demonstrating that these two proteins are the major determinants of the out-breeding mode of reproduction in crucifers.  Our current work aims at understanding the basis of specificity in receptor-ligand interaction, how receptors and ligands co-evolve to generate new self-recognition specificities, and the signal transduction pathway that leads to pollen inhibition.  We are also interested in characterizing the genetic basis of evolutionary switches from out-crossing to self-fertility, and thus understand a major process in the reproductive isolation of plant species.My research focuses on the study of the cell-cell interactions required for plant reproduction.

VAs an evolutionary biologist, I am interested in biodiversity evolution in nature involving genes, genomes, phenomes, populations, species, and ecosystems of bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, and humans, focusing on adaption and speciation. I have conducted local, regional, and global studies, linking interdisciplinary and evolutionarily ecology, cytogenetics, morphology, physiology, and behavior, bridging genotypes and phenotypes, integrating molecular and organismal biology, and elucidating organism-environment relationships. I founded in 1976 and direct the Institute of Evolution at the University of Haifa, a world center of excellence, conducting active integrative research in biodiversity, molecular, genomic, and organismal evolutions, linking field, laboratory, and theoretical research programs across life. In application, I advanced a novel genetic methodology to safeguard the quality of the marine environment. Likewise, I substantiated the idea that wild progenitors of cereal and other cultivars harbor rich genetic resources that should be conserved in-situ and ex-situ. They represent the best hope for future genetic crop improvement, advancing the second genetic green revolution, thereby guaranteeing the increase and stabilization of world food production.As an evolutionary biologist, I am interested in biodiversity evolution in nature involving genes, genomes, phenomes, populations, species, and ecosystems of bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, and humans, focusing on adaption and speciation.

VMy research focuses on language acquisition, with an interest in the mechanisms that underlie this remarkable type of pattern learning. I have studied language acquisition in children as compared with adults, to understand how young children learn their native languages with ease, and why they surpass adults in this ability. Our recent research has proposed a type of learning known as 'statistical learning,' and we have developed techniques for assessing the computational mechanisms underlying such learning. We compare human infants and adults with nonhuman primates, to determine what basic computational abilities these different types of learners share, and where they diverge in the abilities needed to master complex languages. We also study natural sign languages that are learned in a variety of unusual circumstances, permitting us to ask what types of linguistic structure appear in children who receive little or no linguistic input, and how young children exposed to reduced linguistic input can nonetheless make languages more regular and more complex. Taken together, these lines of work suggest that humans display an extraordinary ability to develop and learn languages, whether spoken or signed, and begin to shed light on the processes by which they accomplish these feats.My research focuses on language acquisition, with an interest in the mechanisms that underlie this remarkable type of pattern learning.

VI study the neuronal processes that mediate visual perception and visually guided behavior. My laboratory conducts parallel behavioral and physiological experiments in monkeys that are trained to perform selected perceptual or eye movement tasks. By recording the activity of cortical neurons during performance of such tasks, the laboratory gains initial insights into the relationship of neuronal activity to the animal's behavioral capacities. Hypotheses concerning this relationship are then tested by modifying neural activity within local cortical circuits to determine whether behavior is affected in a predictable manner. Computer modeling techniques can be used to develop more refined hypotheses concerning the relationship of brain to behavior that are both rigorous and testable. This combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, and computational techniques provides a realistic basis for neurophysiological investigation of such cognitive functions as perception, memory, and motor planning.I study the neuronal processes that mediate visual perception and visually guided behavior.

VAs a microbiologist, I have always been fascinated by the observation that gram-negative bacteria (such as E. coli) are intrinsically more resistant to a number of toxic agents, such as antibiotics, biocides, and detergents, than gram-positive bacteria (such as pneumococcus).  This interest led to the notion that the extra membrane layer that is present only in the gram-negatives, the outer membrane, serves as an effective permeability barrier.  Pursuing the molecular basis of this barrier led to the study of lipopolysaccharides, a unique component of the outer membrane.  We found that they are present in the outer membrane bilayer exclusively in the outer leaflet, the asymmetric construction giving rise to the unusually low permeability of this bilayer to lipophilic agents.  Studies in a similar direction also led to the discovery of porins, which function as a molecular sieve, preventing the influx of large or lipophilic agents.  However, the observed resistance levels to many antibiotics cannot be fully explained by the low permeability of the outer membrane alone.  Our more recent studies showed that gram-negative bacteria usually express multidrug efflux pumps of very wide specificity and that these active pumps work synergistically with the passive permeability barrier of the outer membrane.  Our recent efforts are focused on the elucidation of the mechanism of action of these pumps.As a microbiologist, I have always been fascinated by the observation that gram-negative bacteria (such as E. coli) are intrinsically more resistant to a number of toxic agents, such as antibiotics, biocides, and detergents, than gram-positive bacteria (such as pneumococcus).

VMy research interests have focused primarily on how lay people reason and make inferences about the world. I have studied inductive inference, causal analysis, and covariation detection. This work showed that people's everyday-life reasoning was flawed from the standpoint of inadequate use of statistical and other formal inferential rules. A subsequent line of work showed that people's reasoning was surprisingly subject to correction by training in statistics and other fields that teach probabilistic reasoning, methodological rules, and cost-benefit analysis. More recent work on reasoning compares East Asians with Westerners. I find that Westerners reason analytically, that is, they focus on the object (whether physical or social) and its attributes, and use its attributes to categorize it and apply rules to predict and explain its behavior. In contrast, East Asians reason holistically, that is, they focus on the object in its surrounding field, there is little concern with categories or universal rules, and behavior is explained on the basis of the forces presumed to be operative for the individual case at a particular time. Unlike Westerners, East Asians make little use of formal logic, and instead a variety of "dialectic" reasoning types are common, including synthesis and transcendence.My research interests have focused primarily on how lay people reason and make inferences about the world.

In contrast, East Asians reason holistically, that is, they focus on the object in its surrounding field, there is little concern with categories or universal rules, and behavior is explained on the basis of the forces presumed to be operative for the individual case at a particular time. Unlike Westerners, East Asians make little use of formal logic, and instead a variety of "dialectic" reasoning types are common, including synthesis and transcendence.My research interests have focused primarily on how lay people reason and make inferences about the world. I have studied inductive inference, causal analysis, and covariation detection. This work showed that people's everyday-life reasoning was flawed from the standpoint of inadequate use of statistical and other formal inferential rules. A subsequent line of work showed that people's reasoning was surprisingly subject to correction by training in statistics and other fields that teach probabilistic reasoning, methodological rules, and cost-benefit analysis.

VI have been engaged in the study of mechanical properties of materials for more than 40 years.  My early work was on high temperature creep and fracture of metals, focusing on techniques for measuring internal back stresses in deforming metals and featuring the modeling of diffusional deformation and cavity growth processes.  My students and I also studied high temperature dispersion strengthening mechanisms and described the effects of threshold stresses on these creep processes.  Since the mid-1980's we have focused most of our attention on the mechanical properties of thin film materials used in microprocessors and related devices.  We have developed many of the techniques that are now used to study of thin film mechanical properties, including nanoindentation, substrate curvature methods, bulge testing methods and the mechanical testing of micromachined (MEMS) structures.  We are also known for our work on the mechanisms of strain relaxation in heteroepitaxial thin films and plastic deformation of thin metal films on substrates.  In addition we have engaged in research on the growth, characterization and modeling of thin film microstructures, especially as they relate to the development of intrinsic stresses.   Our current work deals with the mechanical properties of nanostructures and with strain gradients and size effects on the mechanical properties of crystalline materials.I have been engaged in the study of mechanical properties of materials for more than 40 years.

VNocera studies of the basic mechanisms of energy conversion in biology and chemistry with primary focus in recent years on the generation of solar fuels from water and sunlight. Solar fuel reactions require the coupling of multielectron processes to protons, which are energetically uphill, thus requiring a light input. Nocera opened the field of multielectron photochemistry by creating and generalizing the concept of two-electron mixed-valency in chemistry. He created the field of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) at a mechanistic level by designing systems that permitted the timing of the electron and proton using time-resolved laser spectroscopy. With the frameworks of multielectron and PCET chemistry in place, Nocera constructed the first molecule to produce hydrogen photocatalytically from homogeneous solution. Hydrogen production, however, represents one half of the water splitting problem. Oxygen also needs to be produced from water. Employing simple materials, Nocera has created the first self-healing catalysts. The self-healing properties of the catalysts permit their use in natural and waste waters, and thus allow solar energy to be stored under benign conditions. The function of the catalysts capture the solar fuels process of photosynthesis outside of the leaf - the splitting of water to hydrogen and oxygen using light from natural water, at atmospheric pressure and room temperature. Because water splitting may be performed under extremely inexpensive conditions, these catalysts enable the large scale deployment of solar energy by providing a mechanism for its storage as a fuel. The new storage mechanism is particularly poised to provide the poor with a distributed solar energy supply.Nocera studies of the basic mechanisms of energy conversion in biology and chemistry with primary focus in recent years on the generation of solar fuels from water and sunlight.

VMy research has concentrated largely on economic growth and its byproducts. One strand has been to determine whether our conventional measuring rods (such as the gross domestic product) accurately capture the effects of growth on economic welfare. More recently, I have pursued this in research on non-market accounting, environmental accounting, and time-use studies. Another strain of my research has been to understand the process of technological change. This work began with studies of the externalities involved in technological change and investigated the value of new technologies in the energy and environmental arenas. Another application of this question was to the process of induced innovation. I have also undertaken a number of studies measuring productivity growth and technological change, including a study of the economic history of lighting back to Babylonian times. In the last decade much of my research has involved understanding the economics of climate change. This research has involved both studies of key economic issues (such as the costs of mitigation and the impacts of climate change) and development of integrated assessment models linking the economic and geophysical aspects of climate change.My research has concentrated largely on economic growth and its byproducts.

VMy research covers a wide range of chemistry including organic synthesis, stereoselective reactions, organometallic chemistry, molecular catalysis, new reaction media, physical organic chemistry, in vivo molecular chemistry, etc. I have long been involved in asymmetric catalysis based on organometallic chemistry. The efficiency of the chiral catalysts discovered in our laboratories equals or, in certain cases, even exceeds that of natural enzymes. Applications of our original and versatile chemistry have allowed us and other scientists to achieve truly efficient synthesis of chiral organic compounds of theoretical and practical importance. In particular, asymmetric hydrogenation via our BINAP-transition metal complex catalysts has been practiced in research laboratories worldwide as well as on an industrial scale. Recently, we have pursued environmentally benign chemical reactions. We demonstrated the utility of supercritical carbon dioxide as a "green" medium for homogeneous catalysis, and also developed practical methods for oxidation of alcohols and olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide under organic solvent- and halide-free conditions.My research covers a wide range of chemistry including organic synthesis, stereoselective reactions, organometallic chemistry, molecular catalysis, new reaction media, physical organic chemistry, in vivo molecular chemistry, etc. I have long been involved in asymmetric catalysis based on organometallic chemistry.

VMy research interest in experimental elementary particle physics included work on various CP violation parameters of neutral kaon system, which led to the first detection of leptonic decay charge asymmetry and the 2-muon decay mode. At LBNL, I developed the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), a new experimental concept that permitted three-dimensional particle tracking and identification over a substantial range of angles and momenta, which has been embraced by several major research facilities. I also initiated R&D efforts to develop "smart-pixel" arrays to enhance vertex detection capabilities, which led to the adoption of "column-based architecture," a concept crucial for the study of high mass particles for the SSC. In high-energy neutrino astronomy, I developed a decentralized system architecture with innovative waveform-recording ASICs that permits high-quality data to be collected within 1 ns accuracy in a km-scale detector embedded in the deep ice at the South Pole, a technique that has been adopted by the ICECUBE collaboration and by the KAMLAND detector being constructed in Japan for the study of neutrino flavor oscillations at reactor energies.My research interest in experimental elementary particle physics included work on various CP violation parameters of neutral kaon system, which led to the first detection of leptonic decay charge asymmetry and the 2-muon decay mode.

VMy research interests fall under three headings.  As an anthropologist, I have used models from evolutionary ecology in the analysis of variation in modern hunter-gatherer foraging and food sharing practices.  My goal has been to identify the principal determinants of these practices and their implications for arguments about human evolution.  As an ethnoarchaeologist, I have studied the relationship between modern hunter-gatherer behavior and its material consequences, focusing especially on factors that shape the composition and distribution of archaeological assemblages at various spatial scales.  This line of work is essential to the application of ethnographic findings to problems in prehistory.  As a prehistorian, I have employed the results of both lines of research in the study of three problems in human evolution: the Plio-Pleistocene origin of genus Homo, the Upper Pleistocene dispersal of Homo sapiens, and terminal Pleistocene development of broad spectrum diets and agriculture.My research interests fall under three headings.

VCells survival depends on the ability to sense and respond to a dynamic and unpredictable environment. My lab is interested in how cells sense and coordinate their response to changing environmental conditions. We have focused primarily on deciphering the mechanisms by which budding yeast cells sense and respond to levels of inorganic phosphate in the environment. These studies have led to a detailed understanding of the regulation of protein function by phosphorylation and to fundamental insights into the control of protein trafficking into and out of the nucleus. We are now focused on determining how the network of proteins involved in these responses allow cells to maintain constant intracellular levels of nutrients and ions despite unpredictable fluctuations in the external environment. Recently, with Jonathan Weissman's group, we have also developed reagents that allow us to monitor properties of virtually the entire complement of proteins expressed by the yeast cell.Cells survival depends on the ability to sense and respond to a dynamic and unpredictable environment.

VMy major research topic is to develop the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution. The theory contends that interaction of random genetic drift and natural selection is important for evolution of genes and genetic systems, and emphasis has been on the role of slightly deleterious mutations. Population genetics studies have been combined with DNA sequence analyses. In particular, comparative studies of mammalian genes have revealed the prevalence of slightly deleterious amino acid substitutions. To account for interaction systems at various levels the nearly neutral theory has been extended to incorporate slightly advantageous mutations that include compensatory changes. My next topic is the evolution of gene families. A population genetics model for gene family evolution has been developed that incorporates unequal crossing over and gene conversion. Here again both drift and selection are working. It has been shown that in gene families with uniform members like those of ribosomal RNA or histone, the rate of unequal crossing over or gene conversion is high and concerted evolution takes place. For gene families with variable members their rates are expected to be low; however, gene conversion followed by natural selection may contribute to high variability of some gene families.My major research topic is to develop the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution.

I am known for my work studying the interaction of the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus with its natural murine host as well as investigations of measles virus. My observations indicated how viruses induce suppression of the immune system to cause a persistent infection and how viruses activate the immune system to cause autoimmunity. I have defined the parameters of the formation and consequences of virus-antiviral antibody immune complex deposits leading to disease, host molecules like IL-10 that the virus induces to suppress the immune system and the description and consequences of how a persistent virus infects differentiated cells, alters their function, disturbs homeostasis and cause disease.I pioneered the field of viral immunology and have been a leader in viral pathogenesis and immunity for the past four decades.

VOur research has focused on venomous marine snails, in particular, those belonging to the genus Conus ("cone snails"). Cone snails are highly specialized venomous predators. We estimate that there are over 100,000 pharmacologically-active peptides in cone snail venoms, and well over 2,000,000 natural products in the venoms of all venomous marine snails (in the superfamily Conoidea). The major research project in our laboratory is the characterization of these venom components and the identification of their molecular targets, and exploration of potential biomedical applications. The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the capture of fish by the ca. ~100 fish-hunting cone snail species are being elucidated in considerable detail by our laboratory; most (but not all) active components in these venoms are small peptides (12-30AA), mostly targeted to ion channels and receptors in the nervous system. One of the peptides isolated by a University of Utah undergraduate in our laboratory has become an approved drug for intractable pain. Recently, we have discovered a novel source of previously inaccessible venomous snails, providing access to a much greater chemical diversity. The study of cone snails and their venom components has expanded our interests into addressing more general issues in chemical ecology and biodiversity research.Our research has focused on venomous marine snails, in particular, those belonging to the genus Conus ("cone snails").

VOur Earth and Solar System have a history, in which processes played out in patterns that are in numerous cases not observable today because their characteristic time scales are too long or they are inherently chaotic, but which have left a history archived in the geological and paleontological record. It is these aspects of Earth History that are uniquely understood by the study of deep time records that I am dedicated to. In particular these include: 1) the analysis of sedimentary strata that record changes in climate paced by the gravitational interactions of the major bodies in the Solar System, both in their short-term quasi-periodic and long-term chaotic behavior as well as the biotic effects of these climate changes; 2) giant physical events, such as extraterrestrial impacts and planetary-scale volcanism, and their biological sequelae including mass-extinctions and adaptive radiations; and 3) evolutionary events especially the appearance of key innovations that have major biogeochemical consequences. Thus far, my research has largely focused on the early Mesozoic Era (145-252 million years ago), but I am extending my approach to both younger and older time periods.Our Earth and Solar System have a history, in which processes played out in patterns that are in numerous cases not observable today because their characteristic time scales are too long or they are inherently chaotic, but which have left a history archived in the geological and paleontological record.

VMy primary research interest is in the molecular mechanisms that control cell destiny during development. To approach this problem my laboratory has studied muscle cells and has discovered a series of developmental control genes that govern muscle cell identity and differentiation. Because the basic mechanisms for muscle development are evolutionarily conserved, it has been possible to use the fruit fly as a simple model system to learn about more complex developmental control mechanisms in mammals. It has recently become clear that many of the gene regulatory proteins and signaling molecules that control cardiac muscle development are also important for remodeling the adult heart during pathologic cardiac enlargement and heart failure. Thus, deciphering the molecular mechanisms that regulate cardiac development and gene expression in model organisms has yielded insights into the molecular bases for congenital and acquired heart disease in humans and is opening opportunities for genetic and pharmacologic modification of cardiac form and function.My primary research interest is in the molecular mechanisms that control cell destiny during development.

VI am interested in the large-scale dynamical processes in the Earth's interior and in other planets. In Earth's interior, the two most important dynamics are the slow convective circulation in the mantle that results in plate tectonics, and the geodynamo, the process by which the geomagnetic field is maintained within the molten outer core. A distinctive property of mantle rocks is that their resistance to flow is extremely sensitive to temperature, pressure, and chemistry. In my laboratory, we use fluids with strongly temperature- and composition-dependent viscosity to construct scale models of mantle convection phenomena. I have investigated the fluid dynamics of the plume upwellings that form volcanic hotspots such as Hawaii, the subduction of oceanic lithosphere that is responsible for the largest earthquakes, and the dynamics of the thermo-chemical boundary layer at the mantle-core interface. I have also constructed laboratory dynamical models for the core, by subjecting liquid metals such as gallium to the effects of rotation, heating, crystallization, and applied magnetic fields. I combine measurements from these laboratory experiments with large-scale numerical simulations to explain geophysical observations.I am interested in the large-scale dynamical processes in the Earth's interior and in other planets.

VMy research interests centers on theoretical and computational methods for molecular biophysics and chemical reactions in condensed matter. In protein folding, our group introduced the concept of protein folding funnels as a mechanism for the folding of proteins. Convergent kinetic pathways, or folding funnels, guide folding to a unique, stable, native conformation. Energy landscape theory and the funnel concept provide the theoretical framework needed both to pose and to address the questions of protein folding and function mechanisms. Connections between these theoretical advances and experiments are central for the development of this new view for protein folding.  A second effort of our group focuses on the theory of chemical reactions in condensed matter with emphasis on biological electron transfer reactions. These reactions are central to the bioenergetic pathways of both animals and plants on Earth, such as the early steps of photosynthesis. Most of the recent work deals with the electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor sites. The concept of tunneling pathways and the methodology for reducing the protein into a combination of relevant tubes of pathways create a new way of designing electron transfer proteins. The connection between this theoretical approach and experiments on electron transfer proteins has substantially improved the understanding of these electron transfer processes. Currently we are broadening our interests to stochastic effects in genetic networks.My research interests centers on theoretical and computational methods for molecular biophysics and chemical reactions in condensed matter.

VBy investigating the regulation of cell division during metazoan development we have discovered proteins crucial for the proper regulation of DNA replication and chromosome segregation that are conserved to humans.  We exploited genetic approaches in Drosophila melanogaster and variant cell cycles that highlight and permit analysis of DNA replication and chromosome segregation to recover mutants that uncovered control proteins.  These studies identified the MEI-S332 protein, founding member of the Shugoshin family, by its essential role at the centromere to promote cohesion and accurate chromosome segregation.  We isolated a protein kinase complex that promotes mitosis by regulating the translation of Cyclin B. We defined the Dup/Cdt1 protein family, a conserved family of proteins that is the crucial factor in triggering the initiation of DNA replication from yeast to human cells.  Our work identified the first binding site for the Origin Recognition Complex in metazoans and revealed a direct role for the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein in DNA replication.  This work unraveled mechanisms by which differential DNA replication is employed as a developmental strategy.  We demonstrated the role of a histone code in chromosome dynamics in meiosis.By investigating the regulation of cell division during metazoan development we have discovered proteins crucial for the proper regulation of DNA replication and chromosome segregation that are conserved to humans.

VMy interests have had the theme of thermal processes in Earth. Early work involved field geology in Venezuela, with laboratory work directed at understanding processes of regional metamorphism. Work in the eastern Alps of Europe and the Pyrenees made possible some of the earliest thermal modeling of crustal displacements. In parallel I collaborated in developing the first models for boundary layer convection in Earth's mantle, which was treated as a high Rayleigh and Prandtl number fluid, predicting both oceanic heat flow and topographic subsidence, and basalt generation by adiabatic decompression. Models were also developed for the thermal structure of descending lithospheric slabs and island arc areas. Thermal modeling was limited by the inadequacy of direct observations of crustal heat flow. A laboratory was therefore established to measure heat flow and radiogenic heat production, largely in Europe. A further constraint on radiogenic heating of the crust is provided by the isotopic composition of rare gases, particularly He. This led to recognition of a still unresolved paradox: an inconsistency between Earth's apparent rates of production of heat and He.  In recent years I have been concerned with science policy and such issues as the management of radioactive wastes.My interests have had the theme of thermal processes in Earth.

VThe main goal of my research is to better understand human evolutionary history through genetic analyses. My research is concentrated in two different areas. The first area is the retrieval of DNA from archaeological and paleontological remains. This allows ancient genetic information to be studied directly. My group has developed technical approaches as well as criteria to authenticate results that have allowed DNA sequences from extinct creatures such as mammoths, moas and ground cloths to be determined and compared to those of extant related animals. We have also retrieved DNA sequences from Neanderthals and shown that they are unlikely to have contributed to any great extent to the gene pool of present-day humans. My second area of interest is the comparative study of genomes and gene expression in humans and the great apes. The goal is to understand how functional aspects of the human genome evolve. Currently, we are particularly interested in the evolution of gene expression in the brain and genetic changes that may underlie aspects of human cognition and the human ability for articulate speech.The main goal of my research is to better understand human evolutionary history through genetic analyses.

VI am interested in explaining the distribution and abundance of plant species, carbon and nutrient cycling, and the interactions between the biosphere and climate. Vegetation is remarkably predictable; a trained person can look anywhere at the vegetation and accurately infer details about the climate, local carbon and nutrient cycling, and the nature of species turnover during succession. Over the past twenty years, I have built mathematical models that translate understanding at the small spatial scales and short time scales, where measurements are practical, to the large spatial scales and long time scales of interest. These take the form of spatial simulation models that simulate the fates of millions of individual plants throughout their life cycles, and macroscopic equations that make the scale translation analytically with moment approximations for the stochastic process in the individual-level simulators. I have also built models of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the moment equations that are used in global climate prediction. I am most interested right now in understanding the two-billion metric ton sink for atmospheric carbon in the terrestrial biosphere and in a simple theory for characteristics of plants along rainfall gradients.I am interested in explaining the distribution and abundance of plant species, carbon and nutrient cycling, and the interactions between the biosphere and climate.

Detailed knowledge of the magnitude and pattern of the fluctuations in temperature from spot to spot on the sky, or anisotropy, help us understand how the universe evolved and how the observed structure, at sizes ranging from galaxies to super clusters of galaxies, formed. From precise measurements of the CMB, most recently done with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite, we have been able to deduce many of the cosmological parameters and have begun to probe the quantum mechanics of the very early universe. For example we have been able to determine the geometry and age of the universe, the cosmic density of baryons, the cosmic density of dark matter, the Hubble parameter, and the scalar spectral index.I work on measuring the spatial temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

VIn the last 25 years my research interests have been centered in the organization and dynamics of the bacterial genome. My research has been developed in collaboration with other colleagues, standing out Jaime Mora, Guillermo Davila and David Romero. We have shown that the Rhizobium genome is proned to frequent rearrangements derived from non-allelic homologous recombination events. Based in such rearrangements we have developed new strategies to manipulate the bacterial genome. The most interesting contribution of this research has been the conception and demonstration of what we refer to as "natural genomic design". Based on the nucleotide sequence of a genome, the major potential rearrangements that such genome can generate may be predicted; subpopulations of bacteria containnig specific rearrangements can be isolated by artificial selection procedures. Pathways of consecutive rearrangements leading to alternative genomic architectures can be designed and the bacterial subpopulations harboring the desired genomic structures can be isolated. I am now starting a research line centered on the dynamics of the human genome.In the last 25 years my research interests have been centered in the organization and dynamics of the bacterial genome.

VAs a virologist I have been interested in the replication of RNA-containing viruses. Special emphasis has been on the influenza viruses, which are negative-strand RNA viruses. My laboratory established the first genetic maps for influenza A, B, and C viruses, identifying the genes coding for specific viral proteins. A long-standing interest has also been the genetic analysis of influenza viruses in order to determine the functions of the genes and gene products. We were first to define the function of the neuraminidase gene and to determine the mechanism of action of neuraminidase inhibitors in the cell; two new FDA-approved antiviral drugs are based on this principle. Another major goal of the laboratory was the development of reverse genetics techniques for negative-strand RNA viruses, which allowed the genetic engineering of these viruses. Such techniques have made it possible to do much more detailed structure-function studies of specific viral genes. In the near future genetically engineered negative-strand RNA viruses may be used as vaccines and/or vaccine vectors in humans and animals. Current efforts in the laboratory are directed at understanding viral pathogenicity and virus-host interactions; specifically, we want to understand the trafficking mechanisms of viral components in the cell and how viruses counteract the antiviral strategies of the infected host cell.As a virologist I have been interested in the replication of RNA-containing viruses.

VMy mathematical work began with the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems (i.e., systems whose long-range behavior exhibits exponential growth and decay of distances along trajectories in complementary directions). They play a central role in dynamics, and once it was thought that every system could be approximated by a hyperbolic one, an idea that soon collapsed except for special sets of systems like the gradient ones. Still, I have proved with Smale that many such systems are dynamically stable when slightly perturbed. Moreover, we conjectured that hyperbolicity is essentially the same as being dynamically stable, which in subsequent decades was proved to be true. I have also conjectured that near every system there is one for which most events will have only finitely many choices where to evolve in the future attractors; the attractors are now required to be only stochastically stable. Several mathematicians proved that the conjecture is true for unimodal maps of the interval. There are also important results on homoclinic (same past and future) bifurcations.My mathematical work began with the study of hyperbolic dynamical systems (i.e., systems whose long-range behavior exhibits exponential growth and decay of distances along trajectories in complementary directions).

VI use approaches of comparative molecular biology, genomics, phylogenetics, and bioinformatics to study various major issues in the evolution of mitrochondrial genes and genomes. At times, these studies also provide valuable phylogenetics insight. Current studies cover the transfer of mitochondrial genes to the nucleus, using flowering plants as a model "system;" the transmission of a promiscuous group I intron that has invaded the mitochondrial cox1 gene thousands of times during angiosperm evolution by lateral transfer; the mutation rate variation discovered in two lineages of plants whose mitochondrial genes are evolving at a rate up to 1,000 times faster than that of other plants; and molecular phylogeny, resulting in what may be the earliest eucaryotes, land plants, and flowering plants along with revised concepts of seed plant evolution.I use approaches of comparative molecular biology, genomics, phylogenetics, and bioinformatics to study various major issues in the evolution of mitrochondrial genes and genomes.

Applications come from electromagnetic wave propagation in the atmosphere, underwater sound, waves in the lithosphere, diffusion in porous media, and other sources. I have studied both linear and non-linear waves and diffusion in both direct and inverse problems. I am now working on assessing multi-pathing effects in communication systems, especially when time reversal arrays are used. Another recent interest is financial mathematics, the use of asymptotics for stochastic equations in analyzing complex models of financial markets, and in data analysis.I have been interested in waves and diffusion in inhomogeneous or random media and in the mathematical analysis of multi-scale phenomena that arise in their study.

VAs a physicist I am fascinated by all those phenomena where the interaction of many degrees of freedom gives rise to a sometime unexpected collective behaviour. In the past I have studied these effects in the framework of quantum field theory and critical phenomena.   At the present moment I am trying to understand the behaviour of glassy systems, which range from spin glasses to structural glasses, and to find out the characteristic features that can be compared with experiment. These glassy systems are characterized by the existence of many quasi-equilibrium states and recently I have done a strong effort to get more precise information on their number and their properties.   This basic research has also important applied applications: for example very efficient methods for solving some difficult optimization problems (e.g. KSAT) have been developed in the last two years using in a crucial way conceptual tools that have been introduced in the study of spin glasses.  I am using similar ideas also for studying systems (often of biological origin) composed by a large number of heterogeneous agents interacting among themselves by exchanging contradictory messages. The goal is to characterize their slow dynamics, dominated by the jumping among quasi-equilibrium states.As a physicist I am fascinated by all those phenomena where the interaction of many degrees of freedom gives rise to a sometime unexpected collective behaviour.

VFor many years I have been studying the mechanism by which oligosaccharides are added to proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the effect that such bulky, highly hydrophylic structures have on the acquisition by glycoproteins of their proper tertiary structures. I was the first to determine that in mammalian cells an oligosaccharide is transferred en bloc from a lipid (dolichol) pyrophosphate derivitive to asparagine units in proteins and to obtain hints that this compound was further processed once transferred. My further studies revealed that the same glycosylation mechanism is operative in the common yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which it may lead to synthesis of mannan, a cell wall polysaccharide. Studies on protein glycosylation conduced in my laboratory showed, first in trypanosomatid protozoa and then in mammalian cells, that protein-linked saccharides are transiently glucosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. The enzyme responsible for glucosylation (UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase) appeared to behave as a sensor of glycoprotein conformations as only glucosylates saccharides linked to improperly folded protein moieties. The glucosyltransferase is a key element in the endoplasmic reticulum retention of malfolded conformers and in the mechanism by which glycoproteins acquire their native three-dimensional structures.For many years I have been studying the mechanism by which oligosaccharides are added to proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the effect that such bulky, highly hydrophylic structures have on the acquisition by glycoproteins of their proper tertiary structures.

VIn recent years it has become possible with novel astrophysical measurements to address such fundamental, almost philosophical, physics questions as the composition, extent, and fate of the Universe. My research has centered on the use of supernova explosion measurements to answer these questions by measuring the expansion history of the Universe. We developed techniques to discover, study, and calibrate significant samples of extremely distant Type Ia supernovae. Their peak brightnesses indicate their distances-and hence how far back in time each supernova explosion occurred. The redshift of each supernova's spectrum tells us how much the Universe has stretched since that time in history. It was expected that the Universe would be found to be expanding faster in the past, since the gravitational effect of mass in the Universe would slow it. Instead, supernova measurements indicate that the Universe is accelerating. Apparently some previously unrecognized energy dominates the Universe, overwhelming the deceleration due to mass. My more recent work is developing techniques to explore this mysterious dark energy. In particular, we are pursuing a new wide-field space telescope experiment designed to extend the supernova measurements of the expansion history farther back in time with significantly better precision.In recent years it has become possible with novel astrophysical measurements to address such fundamental, almost philosophical, physics questions as the composition, extent, and fate of the Universe.

VThe atmospheric circulation, especially the surface winds, strongly influence oceanic currents and hence sea surface temperature patterns in the tropics. Those patterns, whose salient features are large regions of cold surface waters off the western coasts of the Americas and Africa in latitudes where sunlight is intense, in turn have a profound effect on the atmospheric circulation. This interdependence of atmospheric and oceanic conditions implies that interactions between the two media are unstable and give rise to climate fluctuations over a broad spectrum of time-scales. My research interests focus on phenomena whose properties depend on those interactions, including: the seasonal cycle (which as a curious annual harmonic in the eastern equatorial Pacific even though the sun is overhead twice a year); interannual oscillations between El Nino and La Nina (which have intriguingly different properties in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans because of the different dimensions of those ocean basins); decadal modulations of El Nino associated with variations in the oceanic transport of heat from low to high latitudes; and the response of the Earth's climate to the Milankovitch forcing, modest, periodic variations in the distribution of sunlight because of modest, periodic variations in orbital parameters such as the tilt of the Earth's axis. Simulation of these Milankovitch cycles could prove critical tests for climate models that are used to anticipate future global warming.The atmospheric circulation, especially the surface winds, strongly influence oceanic currents and hence sea surface temperature patterns in the tropics.

VI have had twenty five years experience in analyzing science, technology and environmental policy in Asia, Africa and Latin America. During this time I authored nine books and over 90 referred journal articles and book chapters on technological change, productivity growth and environmental management in the developing world. I have been particularly interested in understanding the process of intensification and commercialization of smallholder subsistence systems. My work has ranged from: an in-depth assessment of the Green Revolution in Asia and mechanization in sub-Saharan Africa, to measuring the negative impacts of pesticide use on the environment and human health. My most recent work has focussed on Biotechnology in the developing world, trying to understand the potential for a transition from the Green to the Gene Revolution. I have also been interested in the consequences of rapid diet change, especially among the urban middle classes, on production systems and technology change in the developing world. My latest book examines how small farms in developing countries can be integrated into modern food supply systems in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. I am also helping promote better data systems and agricultural policy decision making in the World's least developed countries.I have had twenty five years experience in analyzing science, technology and environmental policy in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

VMy research focuses on culture change in the prehistoric American Southwest, primarily the Pueblo region of the Four Corners area, with an emphasis on demography, ritual, and social organization from approximately A.D. 800 to the present. My recent focus has been on the Chaco Canyon region of northwestern New Mexico, perhaps the most important center of the Pueblo world in the 11th and 12th centuries.  In a cooperative effort with several other scholars and with the financial support of the Andrew Mellon Foundation and the University of Virginia's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH), we are creating an online digital archive (www.chacoarchive.org) for several of the key excavated sites in the Chaco region.  Our target is the creation of an online analytical database that scholars can use to answer questions about culture change and organization in the region.  My own research on Chaco addresses key aspects of organization, ritual and cosmology.  Most recently, I'm examining variation in mortuary behavior in an effort to better understand much debated questions regarding demographic patterns, social differentiation, and the function of Chacoan great houses.My research focuses on culture change in the prehistoric American Southwest, primarily the Pueblo region of the Four Corners area, with an emphasis on demography, ritual, and social organization from approximately A.D. 800 to the present.

VI was trained in cellular physiology and biophysics. Early in my career, I became fascinated by problems in development. Over the past three decades, I have studied the cellular mechanisms underlying several aspects of neural circuit development - axon/dendrite differentiation and pathfinding, synapse formation and plasticity, and activity-induced refinement of developing neural circuits. For examples, I have examined how extracellular gradients of diffusible or substrate-bound factors may polarize the neuron, initiate axon/dendrite differentiation, and trigger turning of axonal growth cones. I also studied how the growth cone interacts with its target cell during the early phase of synaptogenesis, how neurotrophins and neuronal activities modify the efficacy of synaptic transmission, and more recently how visual inputs shape the properties of retinotectal circuits by activity-induced synaptic modifications. These problems were experimentally addressed in cultures of dissociated neurons, acutely isolated brain slices, and immobilized Xenopus tadpoles and zebrafish larvae, using electrophysiological recording, molecular perturbation, and optical imaging methods. The discovery of spike timing-dependent plasticity in late 90s also triggered my interest in understanding how neural circuits may code and store temporal information, and this led to our recent studies aiming at understanding circuit mechanisms underlying perceptual memory of time intervals.I was trained in cellular physiology and biophysics.

VDuring the last decade or so I have pursued three major research activities. The first is the study of immigration and, in particular, the determinants of successful economic and social adaptation among second-generation youths in the United States. The second is the study of urbanization in less developed countries with an emphasis on the dynamics and effects of the urban informal economies. Informal activities occupy upwards of 80 percent of the population of poor nations, but their dynamics and their potential for growth are not well understood. A five-country comparative study of urbanization in the Caribbean basin conducted during the 1990s, yielded a book on these issues. More recently I have become interested in transnational communities created by large foreign populations in the developed world and consisting of a web of economic and political activities conducted across national borders. The phenomenon holds the potential of changing traditional patterns of immigrant assimilation and affecting significantly the economic prospects of sending areas. In 1998, I completed a survey to clarify the determinants and scope of transnational communities in the United States, and, with the support of several collaborators, I am currently analyzing the survey results.During the last decade or so I have pursued three major research activities.

VI have had a life-long interest in endocrine physiology, with particular emphasis on parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its role in normal and pathophysiological calcium and bone metabolism.  The methodology has been to determine the molecular and cellular basis of PTH action through analysis of the structure of the hormone, its receptor, and the nature and consequences of their interaction.  Clinical disorders in the field have been approached with the tools derived from more basic studies.  For example, chemical synthesis of biologically active hormone permitted direct tests of hormone actions in vivo and have led to formal clinical trials of PTH given in short pulses in osteoporotic bone-a condition of weakened bone with fracture propensity that invariably develops with ageing.  PTH has proven to be the leading anabolic (i.e., direct bone-building) therapeutic agent that reverses much of the bone loss in osteoporosis.  My current interests focus on the precise cellular biological pathways induced by intermittent PTH therapy, since its beneficial effects appear paradoxical in light of the bone-weakening effects seen with prolonged hormone elevations in disease.I have had a life-long interest in endocrine physiology, with particular emphasis on parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its role in normal and pathophysiological calcium and bone metabolism.

VAs a chemist working at the boundary between chemistry and biology, I have studied the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds, a family of molecules that are essential for life in all organisms.  My laboratory has identified and cloned the genes for enzymes that catalyze key reactions for construction the carbon skeletons of isoprenoid molecules and established mechanisms for the enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  We discovered that these reactions share a common mechanistic motif based on electrophilic alkylations of nucleophilic groups and that the enzymes, which catalyze these reactions, share a common structural motif, the isoprenoid fold.   More recently, we found that relatively modest structural changes in the enzymes can change the carbon skeletons of the products produced and that minor alterations in the catalytic machinery of only two isoprenoid synthase enzymes give a family of proteins that synthesize the 7 of the 8 fundamental isoprenoid carbon skeletons found in nature.  I am trying to decipher how the structural changes lead to changes in the products formed as a basis for understanding how new biosynthetic reactions and pathways might have evolved.As a chemist working at the boundary between chemistry and biology, I have studied the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds, a family of molecules that are essential for life in all organisms.

VMy main scientific interest over the last 25 years has been the study of Ca2+ as a universal intracellular second messenger. My interests in Ca2+ signaling began with the characterization, in isolated organelles, of the mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostatic mechanisms. Later during my post doc in Cambridge, UK, I participated to the development of the intracellular trappable fluorescent Ca2+ indicators and in the following years using this tools I could clarify a number of key questions in the activation of leukocytes. My group developed the first genetically encoded probes with selective subcellular localization (targeted aequorins). This new approach leads to a series of novel discoveries on the mechanisms of subcellular Ca2+ handling and in particular to the understanding of how mitochondria participate in cellular Ca2+ handling (thus setting the basis for the understanding of the participation of these organelles in apoptosis). My present interests focus on a detailed description and understanding of the mechanisms of Ca2+ uptake and release in mitochondria in situ and on the role of Ca2+ signaling in the neuron-glia cross talk in the CNS.  Finally over the last few years I became interested also in the signaling pathway controlled by the other universal intracellular messenger, cAMP. My group generated the first genetically encoded fluorescent cAMP probe and we have contributed to establishing the concept of cAMP microdomains, a topic that we are actively investigating at the moment.My main scientific interest over the last 25 years has been the study of Ca2+ as a universal intracellular second messenger.

My interests in Ca2+ signaling began with the characterization, in isolated organelles, of the mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostatic mechanisms. Later during my post doc in Cambridge, UK, I participated to the development of the intracellular trappable fluorescent Ca2+ indicators and in the following years using this tools I could clarify a number of key questions in the activation of leukocytes. My group developed the first genetically encoded probes with selective subcellular localization (targeted aequorins). This new approach leads to a series of novel discoveries on the mechanisms of subcellular Ca2+ handling and in particular to the understanding of how mitochondria participate in cellular Ca2+ handling (thus setting the basis for the understanding of the participation of these organelles in apoptosis). My present interests focus on a detailed description and understanding of the mechanisms of Ca2+ uptake and release in mitochondria in situ and on the role of Ca2+ signaling in the neuron-glia cross talk in the CNS.  Finally over the last few years I became interested also in the signaling pathway controlled by the other universal intracellular messenger, cAMP.

VMy long-term research interests have centered on the experimental use of high-energy polarized electrons to study electroweak structure and spin structure of the nucleon through deep inelastic scattering from unpolarized and polarized targets and the study of production and decay processes of the Z-zero boson in polarized electron-unpolarized positron annihilation at the Z-zero pole. The study of polarized targets results in the understanding of the spin structure of the proton and neutron. In the context of the quark-parton model the contributions of the constituents of the nucleon are understood. The study of unpolarized targets and the Z-zero boson with polarized electrons leads to the precise determination of electroweak parameters, an important part of the Standard Model, which summarizes our present understanding of the forces and constituents of matter. My most recent interests have centered on extending the polarized electron beam work to a future linear collider, and the study of neutrinoless double beta decay, a non-accelerator project, to determine the mass of the neutrinos.My long-term research interests have centered on the experimental use of high-energy polarized electrons to study electroweak structure and spin structure of the nucleon through deep inelastic scattering from unpolarized and polarized targets and the study of production and decay processes of the Z-zero boson in polarized electron-unpolarized positron annihilation at the Z-zero pole.

VMy early interest in the SV40 DNA tumor virus as a model for eukaryotic gene expression and oncogenic transformation eventually led me to study the p53 tumor suppressor protein. P53 had been identified by others as a protein that stably associates with the viral large tumor (T) antigen. In our earlier studies we and others showed that p53 is a sequence specific regulator of transcription. We found that both the common tumor derived mutations within p53 protein as well as SV40 T antigen prevent p53 binding to and activation of its target genes. My group has since focused extensively on how p53 interacts with DNA, examining how covalent modifications and non-covalent modifiers regulate p53 DNA binding and transactivation of its target genes. We have become particularly intrigued with the many modes by which different p53 target genes are selectively regulated leading to different cellular outcomes such as cell cycle arrest and cell death. We have also examined the complex circuitry between p53 and its negative regulators Mdm2 and MdmX and our work has touched upon the roles of upstream regulators of p53 including the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. Finally, I have had an ongoing interest in the complex interrelationships between p53 and its homologues p63 and p73.My early interest in the SV40 DNA tumor virus as a model for eukaryotic gene expression and oncogenic transformation eventually led me to study the p53 tumor suppressor protein.

VI have worked in the political science subfields of comparative politics, international relations, and U.S. politics. In comparative politics I have studied the conditions that undergird effective democratic governance in modern societies, drawing mostly on field research in Western Europe. My most widely cited research in this subfield explored why some local governments in Italy worked well, while others failed; I found the answer in social capital, that is, the degree of civic engagement and social connectedness in different parts of Italy. My research in international relations investigated the role of domestic influences on international cooperation and conflict. In particular, I developed a model of two-level games that synthesizes the simultaneous domestic and international negotiations that frequently characterize international relations.  My most recent research has centered on the "bowling alone" hypothesis, that is, the general erosion of social capital (social connectedness, trust, civic engagement) in the contemporary United States. I have examined both the causes and the consequences of this trend. I am currently working with public officials and local activists to find possible remedies.I have worked in the political science subfields of comparative politics, international relations, and U.S. politics.

VMy research interests are in the area of photosensory perception and signal transduction in plants.  We study the molecular mechanisms by which the phytochrome family of informational photoreceptors transduce perceived light signals to target nuclear genes.  Using biochemical, molecular and genetic approaches in the model organism, Arabidopsis, we have identified a signaling pathway involving direct interaction of the photoactivated phytochrome molecule with a subset of basic helix-loop-helix-class transcription factors, following light-induced translocation of the photoreceptor into the nucleus from the cytoplasm.  Current efforts are directed at defining the molecular mechanism of signal transfer from the phytochrome molecule to these apparent signaling partners.  Using global transcript profiling we have also defined target genes of the phytochrome pathway.  We are currently attempting to dissect the primary transcriptional network controling the light-induced expression pattern displayed by these genes.My research interests are in the area of photosensory perception and signal transduction in plants.

VMy area of research is theoretical particle physics. For many years my chief interest has been to decipher the details of the tiny differences between the laws of physics for matter and those for antimatter. The technical term for this difference is CP Symmetry Violation. The deep question behind this interest is to understand how, given that matter and antimatter have such similar physical properties, the Universe came to be dominated by matter. My research however, focuses on the particle physics, not the cosmology, since the latter can only be understood once we have a good understanding of the former. My focus in recent years is thus on how experiments looking at B decays can overconstrain our current theory and thereby obtain precision probes for features that do not fit within that picture. Precision tests require precision theory; my interest is in defining tests that are as free as possible form uncertainties in the theoretical predictions that arise due to the effects of strong interaction physics, which we cannot reliably calculate.My area of research is theoretical particle physics.

VMy colleagues and I have been interested in how developing animal cells decide whether to live or die, grow or stop growing, proliferate or stop proliferating, or differentiate into one cell type rather than another. We have addressed these questions mainly in the rodent central nervous system (CNS), using the optic nerve and retina as model systems. Not surprisingly, we found that all of these decisions depend on a combination of cell-cell interactions and cell-intrinsic programs. For example, we found that many, if not all; mammalian cells require extracellular signals from other cells to avoid apoptosis, which is mediated by an intracellular suicide program.  In the optic nerve, we identified a number of the molecules that control these types of decisions in the oligodendrocyte cell lineage, the cells that make myelin in the CNS. We have been especially interested in the timing mechanism that stops cell division and initiates differentiation at the appropriate time in development. The timer depends on a number of intracellular proteins, whose concentrations increase or decrease progressively as the precursor cells proliferate.   To help understand how the size of an animal or organ is determined, we studied the factors that control the final number of oligodendrocytes in the optic nerve and those that determine the size of a developing Schwann cell when it divides.My colleagues and I have been interested in how developing animal cells decide whether to live or die, grow or stop growing, proliferate or stop proliferating, or differentiate into one cell type rather than another.

VMy research has elucidated the cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the process of insect egg production. Because their egg development is tightly linked to the intake of vertebrate blood, blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes, serve as vectors of numerous diseases devastating to humans and domestic animals. My early cell biological investigations have lead to a basic understanding of developmental programs occurring in mosquito females under the control of blood meal-driven regulatory cascades. This was followed by the biochemical and molecular characterization of a system of ligands and receptors involved in these processes.  Control by the steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone, is central to the regulation of mosquito egg development, and we have deciphered the genetic hierarchy of transcriptional regulators underlying this hormone action. The cyclicity of egg maturation in mosquitoes necessitates their frequent contacts with vertebrate hosts, thereby aiding the transmission of pathogens.  We determined the molecular basis of genetic switches required for a transition from one egg maturation cycle to the next. Importantly, we found that nutritional control overrides other regulatory mechanisms and amino acids from the ingested blood signal directly via the target-of-rapamycin kinase pathway to activate massive translational and transcriptional events leading to egg maturation.  Development of genetic transformation in mosquitoes permitted us to perfect this technique as a tool to study regulatory regions of blood meal-regulated genes. This, in turn, has lead to the development of transgenic mosquitoes with altered immunity and has launched studies of mosquito immunity and its interaction with pathogens.My research has elucidated the cellular, molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying the process of insect egg production.

VAs geographer and archaeologist, I have focused my research toward a better understanding of the relationship between the different phases of human settlements and the exploitation of natural resources in Madagascar. At the beginning, about 2000 years ago, the first migrants landing to Madagascar tried to locate safe areas and fertile lands. Once established, their situations evolved according to structural processes (demographic growth, political struggle) or incidental events (wars, famines, epidemics). These conditions often forced them to expand their territory or to migrate to other regions. According to circumstances, some communities can end up in a region which is not in concordance with their initial way of life. It seems globally that there is a misbalance between rural agricultural practices and natural resources availability (leading to such practices as heavy deforestation and the setting of bush fires). Presently, despite numerous academic papers produced, one of the remaining key issues is to find the reasons explaining why a large part of rural communities continue their obsolete agricultural practices. To be involved in the modern world market system does not seem to be their priority. They live in a different scale and use a different logic to assess their value of life. By exploring various data dealing with these early settlers of Madagascar and comparing them with present situations, it would be possible to provide some relevant answers to these noticeable contradictions.As geographer and archaeologist, I have focused my research toward a better understanding of the relationship between the different phases of human settlements and the exploitation of natural resources in Madagascar.

Presently, despite numerous academic papers produced, one of the remaining key issues is to find the reasons explaining why a large part of rural communities continue their obsolete agricultural practices. To be involved in the modern world market system does not seem to be their priority. They live in a different scale and use a different logic to assess their value of life. By exploring various data dealing with these early settlers of Madagascar and comparing them with present situations, it would be possible to provide some relevant answers to these noticeable contradictions.

VI seek to understand how atmospheric gases, clouds, and aerosols regulate the planetary greenhouse effect, solar radiative heating, and climate. As a postdoctoral fellow I identified the greenhouse effect of the vibration-rotation bands of chlorofluorocarbons, which per molecule were about 10,000 times more effective than CO2 as a greenhouse gas. This surprising finding opened the door to the discovery of the greenhouse effect of numerous other trace gases and the field of trace gases-climate-chemistry interactions. Clouds were my next focus; I designed a satellite radiation budget experiment with NASA scientists and demonstrated that clouds had a net cooling effect on the planet (i.e., the reflection of solar radiation to space by clouds far exceeded their greenhouse effect). This cloud radiative-forcing data is still being used to validate climate models. My current interest is the influence of submicron engineered particles in the atmosphere. I designed (along with P. J. Crutzen) the Indian Ocean Experiment, which led to the discovery of the widespread South Asian Brown Haze, and its surprisingly large impact in reducing the solar radiation at the surface, as it not only cools the region but could also lead to global drying. This work led to a U.N. project to study the impact of such brown clouds worldwide. I am now designing an experiment using miniaturized instruments and unmanned aircraft to understand how the planet regulates its albedo.I seek to understand how atmospheric gases, clouds, and aerosols regulate the planetary greenhouse effect, solar radiative heating, and climate.

VChemistry is largely concerned with structure, function, and mechanism. I have tried to concentrate on mechanism as the common theme underlying molecular behavior. My theoretical work, usually done in close collaboration with experimentalists and with other theorists, has focused on a number of mechanistic phenomena central to chemical structure and processes, particularly electron transfer, molecular electronics, quantum dynamics, and conductive and optical response of molecular and polymeric structures. This work has included some methods development (dynamic percolation models, dynamic mean fields, and decoupling approximations). More commonly my group has worked on application of appropriate theoretical models and methods to derive structure and function relationships between molecular structures and the susceptibilities and properties of molecular matter. Particular interests include transport in molecular junctions, control of electron transfer reactions, and dephasing and coherence in quantum dynamics.Chemistry is largely concerned with structure, function, and mechanism.

VMy research interests focus on the mechanisms by which the immune system effectively defends the host against foreign pathogens while maintaining tolerance to self antigens and avoiding the pathological consequences of autoimmunity. My laboratory investigates the role of IgG antibodies as both regulatory and effector molecules in the immune response through their interaction with cognate receptors on lymphoid and myeloid cells. We are manipulating the expression of these antibody receptors and the structure of their IgG ligands to either enhance the immunogenicity of antigens and therapeutic antibodies for more effective vaccination or restore tolerance and suppress inflammation in autoimmune diseases. Our recent studies on the contribution of specific carbohydrate moieties linked to the IgG Fc domain on the pro- or anti-inflammatory activity of this molecule is leading us to explore the regulation of specific glycoforms of IgG in protective and pathological states and the mechanisms by which these activities are achieved in the body. Our work aims to both define the basic mechanisms that regulate the immune response and develop the means of manipulating those mechanisms to design novel therapeutic approaches to infectious, neoplastic and autoimmune diseases.My research interests focus on the mechanisms by which the immune system effectively defends the host against foreign pathogens while maintaining tolerance to self antigens and avoiding the pathological consequences of autoimmunity.

VMy major interest is to understand what happens to molecules released into the atmosphere and, in turn, how these molecules affect the atmosphere. Towards this interest, we identify and quantify middle- and lower-atmospheric chemical processes through laboratory studies. My group studies the thermal gas phase reactions, photochemical processes, and heterogeneous and multiphase reactions of various chemical species known, or expected, to be present in the atmosphere. We have been able to determine the atmospheric lifetimes of various molecules and the impact of these molecules on depletion of stratospheric ozone, production of tropospheric ozone, and climate. We have been able to assess the roles of present or future molecules on stratospheric ozone and climate. This work also helps in understanding the chemical composition of the atmosphere. These studies, carried out under atmospheric conditions of pressure, composition, and temperature, have shown the existence of interesting chemical phenomenon. I am also interested in understanding the chemical signatures of species in ice cores and bio-geochemical cycling of chemicals in the Earth system. My work now also deals with regional air quality, urban air pollution, and climate-related issues.My major interest is to understand what happens to molecules released into the atmosphere and, in turn, how these molecules affect the atmosphere.

VAs a structural biochemist I am interested in the general area of structural bioenergetics to understand the molecular basis of energy transduction processes. My laboratory has studied complex metalloproteins and integral membrane proteins, using crystallographic approaches to establish structure and function relationships, particularly for electron-transfer-based energy transduction pathways involving both water-soluble and membrane proteins. Our interest in metalloproteins has centered on proteins that incorporate unusual molybdenum- and tungsten-containing centers, including the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase and the more widespread molybdenum cofactor that participate in many of the basic reactions of the biological nitrogen and sulfur cycles. From a structural bioenergetics perspective the nitrogenase structure is also of interest since nitrogenase couples nucleotide hydrolysis to redox chemistry and exhibits striking parallels to nucleotide-dependent signal transduction systems. The membrane protein studies have concenrated on energy transduction processes associated with photosynthesis, respiration, and mechanosensation through structural analysis of the photosynthetic reaction center, fumarate reductase, and a gated mechanosensitive channel.As a structural biochemist I am interested in the general area of structural bioenergetics to understand the molecular basis of energy transduction processes.

VMy research has focused on sex and racial inequality in the workplace during the four decades since federal policies banned employment discrimination and job segregation.  Sex and race segregation across occupations, firms, and jobs, which exposes women and men of different races to more or less rewarding lines of work, has declined very slowly.  My attempts to understand the persistence of sex segregation has led me to social psychological research on the vulnerability of job assignments and promotion decisions to automatic cognitive errors (stereotypes and ingroup preferences).  Because these errors are most likely when decision making processes are subjective and decision makers enjoy considerable discretion, I study employment structures and practices that permit or constrain the biasing effects of cognitive errors on job assignments.  Recognizing the importance of organizational structures has led me to expand my research to (1) highlight the more general importance of identifying the mechanisms that produce varying levels of inequality, and (2) simultaneously examine a variety of categorical distinctions (e.g., race, ethnicity) that trigger automatic biases.  I am developing analytic techniques that are useful for assessing differential outcomes for a large number of categorical groups.  In addition, I have been modeling the links between categorical inequality across spheres (e.g., neighborhood residence, education, incarceration, employment) to investigate whether this system of inequality attenuates the impact of policy interventions in single spheres.  I am also currently studying the ramifications of the growth of subprime credit markets for class and race inequality.My research has focused on sex and racial inequality in the workplace during the four decades since federal policies banned employment discrimination and job segregation.

VI work in arithmetical algebraic geometry (or arithmetic), a field of number theory that uses tools from algebraic geometry to study diophantine problems. Such problems arise when one seeks to identify all solutions to an equation (or family of equations) that are whole numbers, fractions, or other quantities in number theory. For example, whole number solutions to the diophantine equation x^2 + z^2 = 2y^2 correspond to triples of perfect squares, like (1, 25, 49), in which the middle entry is the average of the first and third entries. Although the field of arithmetic uses many technical tools of recent vintage, its study is motivated by some of the oldest problems in mathematics. In the last decade the most notable success of arithmetic was the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, a simple statement about perfect powers whose demonstration had eluded mathematicians for over 350 years.I work in arithmetical algebraic geometry (or arithmetic), a field of number theory that uses tools from algebraic geometry to study diophantine problems.

Knowledge of chromatin structure is indispensable for an accurate description of nuclear processes including the propagation of epigenetic traits, and will consequently have substantial impact on the treatment and prevention of disease. I have chosen X-ray crystallography, and more recently, cryo-electron microscopy as the primary techniques to image chromatin. Continuing from our crystal structures of the nucleosome core and various transcription factor complexes, we are currently studying the chromatin fiber and interacting components such as chromatin remodeling factors.My laboratory endeavors to reveal the hierarchal structure of chromatin at atomic resolution, and to apply the results to the elucidation of mechanisms of gene expression.

VA common feature of my research has been the effort to combine theory and experiments to develop quantitative geophysical and geochemical models rich enough to shed some light on actual geological phenomena yet simple enough that causal relationships can be understood in generalizable terms. Geophysical topics that I have worked on include mantle convection, the driving mechanism of plate tectonics, and the thermal evolution of Earth. Those with a more geochemical flavor include melt segregation, sedimentary pore-water chemistry, 40Ar/39Ar thermochronometry, and chemical diffusion in molten silicates systems. My most recent research focuses on kinetic stable isotope fractionations as "fingerprints" of mass transport process. Laboratory experiments are used to demonstrate isotope fractionations during chemical diffusion between natural melts. I am also using high-temperature vacuum experiments in which silicon and magnesium are evaporated from molten silicates to calibrate the relationship between mass loss and the resulting isotopic fractionation of the residue. The rates and isotopic fingerprint of evaporation are then used to determine the thermal history of particular types of isotopically fractionated meteorite inclusions that were processed during the earliest stages of solar system evolution.A common feature of my research has been the effort to combine theory and experiments to develop quantitative geophysical and geochemical models rich enough to shed some light on actual geological phenomena yet simple enough that causal relationships can be understood in generalizable terms. Geophysical topics that I have worked on include mantle convection, the driving mechanism of plate tectonics, and the thermal evolution of Earth. Those with a more geochemical flavor include melt segregation, sedimentary pore-water chemistry, 40Ar/39Ar thermochronometry, and chemical diffusion in molten silicates systems.

VAs an ecologist, I have been interested in the origin and maintenance of diversity in the natural world, particularly the number of species but also their variety of form and life histories, including rates of growth and development, reproduction, and aging. A part of my work concerns the how the faunas of oceanic islands are shaped by colonization and extinction, which I have placed in a temporal context using the DNA-sequence-based methods of phylogeography. These studies have demonstrated non-synchronized phases of expansion and contraction in birds of the West Indies (taxon cycles) possibly resulting from intrinsic evolutionary dynamics between pathogens and their hosts, for which studies on the distribution of avian malaria serve as a model system. I have also used phylogenetic reconstruction to explore the diversification of evolving clades and its relationship to the filling of ecological space. Another aspect of my interest in diversity has been the interpretation of life-history traits as both ecological and evolutionary (adaptive) responses to variation in the environment, most recently in regard to constraints on the prolongation of potential life span in organisms that suffer little extrinsic mortality.As an ecologist, I have been interested in the origin and maintenance of diversity in the natural world, particularly the number of species but also their variety of form and life histories, including rates of growth and development, reproduction, and aging.

VI am a Professor of Astronomy and Physics at the Johns Hopkins University and a Senior member of the Science Staff at the Space Telescope Science Institute, where I work on measuring the cosmological framework with supernovae (exploding stars) and Cepheids (pulsating stars). In 1998 I led a study for the High-z Team which provided the first direct evidence that the expansion of the Universe was accelerating and filled with Dark Energy. This study was the proverbial one which created more questions than answers! I followed this work with a number of studies to test the susceptibility of this measurement to contamination by unexpected types of dust or evolution. To this aim, I led the Hubble Higher-z Team beginning in 2002 to find 25 of the most distant supernovae known with the Hubble Space Telescope, all at redshift greater than 1. This work culminated in the first highly significant detection of the preceding, decelerating epoch of the Universe and helped to confirm the reality of acceleration by disfavoring alternative, astrophysically-motivated explanations for the faintness of supernovae. More recently I have turned my attention to improving the precision of our knowledge of the present expansion rate of the Universe, known as the Hubble constant. By measuring this quantity to within a few percent accuracy we can further constrain the properties of dark energy as well as the masses of neutrinos.I am a Professor of Astronomy and Physics at the Johns Hopkins University and a Senior member of the Science Staff at the Space Telescope Science Institute, where I work on measuring the cosmological framework with supernovae (exploding stars) and Cepheids (pulsating stars).

VAs a geneticist, I have been attracted to issues of gene regulation, cell biology and genomics in organisms ranging from yeast to human. I discovered the four Sir genes of yeast which are responsible for forming heterochromatin at specific positions in the genome. With members of my lab, we discovered the epigenetic inheritance of silenced chromatin. We discovered the first mutations in the Origin Recognition Complex and established their link to DNA replication and to silencing. We discovered the spreading of heterochromatin from silencers, and established the mechanism of spreading through biochemical studies as well as genetic studies at the single-cell level. We also discovered the enzymes responsible for the prenylation of Ras and other G proteins, and a pair of proteases that trim the ends of prenylated proteins. These activities proved to be essential for the activated phenotypes of oncogenic mutations in Ras. I was also the founder of Dog Genome Project, and led the team that developed the first complete genetic map of the Dog. More recently, I have turned my attention to the interpretation human genetic variation, to the discovery of cofactor remedial mutations, and to nutritional links to human epigenetic events.As a geneticist, I have been attracted to issues of gene regulation, cell biology and genomics in organisms ranging from yeast to human.

VMy research interests center on devising novel mathematical and cryptographic approaches to security problems of real-world interest. Much of my work has focused on the development of new cryptographic primitives, such as the RSA public-key cryptosystem (joint with Shamir and Adleman), the MD5 hash function, the block ciphers RC4, RC5, and RC6, tweakable block ciphers, and various digital signature schemes, such as ring signatures and transitive digital signatures. I have also worked on a mathematical framework (SPKI/SDSI) for naming, credentials, and authorization. My more recent work addresses security and privacy issues arising from recent technical advances. For example, radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips will soon be a common way of labeling objects; yet pervasive use of RFID chips threatens individual privacy. I have developed (with Juels and Szydlo) an RFID "blocker tag" that protects an individual's privacy by selectively blocking RFID readers. As another example, I have developed (with Micali) an efficient probabilistic yet fair micropayment method. Most recently, I have been working on the security of electronic voting systems, emphasizing the maintenance of voter privacy. I have also become more involved in the policy aspects of privacy and of voting.My research interests center on devising novel mathematical and cryptographic approaches to security problems of real-world interest.

VThe neutrino has challenged physicists for more than 70 years. My interest in these elementary particles began in 1980 when experimental efforts to see if neutrinos had mass reached an impasse set by the atomic excitations of radioactive atoms in sources used for this work. My colleagues and I built a new apparatus at Los Alamos to search for neutrino mass with gaseous molecular tritium, where the excitations could be well understood. We did not find mass then, but were able to show that electron neutrinos were not heavy enough to be the dark matter of the universe. In 1988 our attention turned to the solar neutrino problem, which was generally thought to be a technical problem, but which could have been a signal that neutrinos had mass. In 2001 our Sudbury Neutrino Observatory data showed that indeed all the neutrinos were there, and the "problem" was that they were not all electron neutrinos. That was convincing evidence for neutrino mass. Neutrino mass is beyond our once-trusty Standard Model of particles and fields. Oddly enough, while neutrinos do have mass, they are only a minor component of the dark matter. Other puzzles remain: Are neutrinos and antineutrinos the same particle?The neutrino has challenged physicists for more than 70 years.

VRobinson uses the honey bee to discover neural, endocrine, molecular and genomic mechanisms of social behavior. Through comparative studies of these mechanisms in other social and solitary Hymenoptera, his work examines the evolution of social life. Honey bees live in highly structured societies comprising tens of thousands of individuals able to communicate and coordinate their activities. Individual bees perform complex behaviors, and switch between behavioral states in response to changes in the environment, the needs of the hive, and their own physiological state. An important goal is to discover molecular mechanisms, including changes in brain gene expression and neurochemical signaling, that couple these factors with changes in behavior. This work has led to the important insight that transcriptional activity in the bee brain is sensitive to the environment; changes in behavioral state are associated with sometimes dramatic changes in gene expression. The same dynamic regulation of brain gene expression has now been documented in many other animal species. Current research continues to examine the interplay among gene expression, environment, and social behavior, and explores whether the proximate mechanisms that facilitate these relationships represent a \u201cmolecular toolkit\u201d for social life, shared across distantly related species.Robinson uses the honey bee to discover neural, endocrine, molecular and genomic mechanisms of social behavior.

VAs a radio astronomer, I have dedicated most of my research effort to understanding the phenomenon of star formation. In the last three decades we have seen major advances in our understanding of how the stars assemble from much larger, diffuse structures called interstellar clouds. From a simple picture in which a piece of these clouds contracted gravitationally to form  a new star, we have evolved to a much richer scenario, in which the growing star does gain gas from the surrounding space, but ejects a fraction of this gas back to the interstellar medium. This ejected gas gives rise to phenomena such as the Herbig-Haro objects and the molecular outflows that can be studied in the vicinity of the forming star. These advances were obtained by a large international community, but the Mexican group of which I form part did play an important role both observationally and theoretically. We are now trying to understand what happens around these forming stars, where disks of gas and cosmic dust are present and should be in their way of transforming into plane.As a radio astronomer, I have dedicated most of my research effort to understanding the phenomenon of star formation.

VMy lab studies meiosis, using budding yeast as a model system.  We have focused on the interactions between homologous chromosomes that occur during meiotic prophase and ensure the proper segregation of chromosomes at the first meiotic division.  These interactions include homolog pairing, chromosome synapsis (i.e., synaptonemal complex assembly) and genetic recombination.  We have demonstrated roles for telomeres and for centromeres in the pairing of homologous chromosomes.  Our studies have identified genes that encode building blocks of the synaptonemal complex, the proteinaceous structure that holds homologous chromosomes close together along their lengths during mid-meiotic prophase.  We have also identified a complex of proteins involved in the initiation of chromosome synapsis and shown that centromeres are preferred sites for synapsis initation early in meiotic prophase.  We have used mutations in genes encoding synaptonemal complex proteins to investigate the role of the complex in crossing over, chromosome segregation and the proper distribution of meiotic recombination events.  Our work has identified two distinct pathways of meiotic recombination and characterized a mechanism that inhibits the mitotic recombination machinery in meiotic cells.  We have also identified and characterized components of the cell cycle checkpoint that prevents exit from meiotic prophase until meiotic recombination has been completed.My lab studies meiosis, using budding yeast as a model system.

VAs a molecular geneticist, I have worked with my students and postdoctoral associates on various aspects of gene expression as well as on circadian rhythms. Our gene expression work has focused on nuclear RNA processing, namely, the complex set or reactions that RNA undergoes within the nucleus. We have used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an experimental organism, because of the ability to apply genetic methods to the study of these processing reactions. We originally focused on pre-mRNA splicing and have become interested more recently in more general aspects of nuclear RNP (RNA-protein) formation as well as the mechanistic requirements for RNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm: the travels of an RNA molecule from birth to its function in protein synthesis. Our circadian rhythm work has used the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as an experimental system. Like humans, flies undergo circa. 24 hour behavioral and molecular rhythms. The rich genetics of Drosophila has allowed the identification and study of the proteins that underlie the central clock in flies, i.e., the quartz crystal for circadian timekeeping. Remarkably, the same proteins function in a very similar way to run mammalian clocks, including those of humans.As a molecular geneticist, I have worked with my students and postdoctoral associates on various aspects of gene expression as well as on circadian rhythms.

VAs a nutritional biochemist, I have studied cellular factors involved in the biosynthesis and transport of vitamin A molecules, focusing on the interaction of cellular retinoid-binding proteins and enzymes that esterify retinol for transport, storage, and oxidation. Our intent has been to link biochemical findings with nutritional studies to better understand how vitamin A homeostasis is regulated by dietary status and metabolic conditions, including lactation. We began by characterizing the retinyl ester pattern of milk and identifying an enzyme in the lacatating mammary gland capable of forming retinyl esters. While we found this enzyme, ARAT, in other tissues, further studies identified an acyltransferase, LRAT, and its interaction with cellular retinol-binding protein as being important for hepatic retinol esterification and storage in liver and lung. In these organs, LRAT is regulated in a graded manner, at the mRNA level, by vitamin A at levels resembling those in human diets. We also have studied the functional outcomes of vitamin A status on the immune system, demonstrating that the requirement for vitamin A is conditional, and showing synergism between vitamin A and immune stimuli in enhancing antibody production. These results suggest strategies for improving antibody responses in neonates, which generally are low.As a nutritional biochemist, I have studied cellular factors involved in the biosynthesis and transport of vitamin A molecules, focusing on the interaction of cellular retinoid-binding proteins and enzymes that esterify retinol for transport, storage, and oxidation.

VMy interests and work concern various areas relating mathematics and physics. I was part of the effort that created a mathematically rigorous theory of equilibrium statistical mechanics. This is the study of infinite systems of particles at a given temperature, and of the changes (phase transitions) that occur when the temperature is varied. I also participated in the effort to understand chaos. Chaotic time evolutions, like those occurring in hydrodynamic turbulence, are deterministic but irregular and of limited predictability. The problem here was to make sense of the experimental data and to create an appropriate mathematical theory for their description. The necessary mathematics is part of smooth dynamics and ergodic theory. These same mathematical theories are also needed to understand nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, which is the theory of irreversible processes, like heat diffusion and also the multiple processes of life. This is my current domain of interest. As a sideline, I have pondered the relations between physics, mathematics, and the structure of the human brain.

VMy laboratory studies the metabolic pathways that cells use to break down cholesterol. Various tissues, including the liver, skin, prostate, and brain, utilize different enzymes to metabolize cholesterol. In the liver, we isolated 8 of the 16 enzymes that convert cholesterol into bile acids and identified the molecular bases of three inherited forms of liver failure in humans. In the skin, we purified the enzyme that produces 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, the major circulating form of vitamin D in the blood, and showed that mutations in this gene cause rickets. In the prostate, we identified two genes that synthesize the potent male hormone dihydrotestosterone. Mutations in one of the encoding genes cause male pseudohermaphroditism, and drugs that inhibit both enzymes are used to treat prostatic disease and baldness. In the brain, we isolated the enzyme responsible for the majority of cholesterol turnover, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase. Loss of this brain-selective enzyme in the mouse reduced cholesterol turnover, which unexpectedly led to learning deficits and decreased synaptic plasticity. Currently, we are elucidating the neurobiological mechanism by which alterations in cholesterol turnover affect learning and memory and we are developing chemical methods to identify novel lipids and their biological roles in mammalian cells.My laboratory studies the metabolic pathways that cells use to break down cholesterol.

VIn my lab I use C. elegans molecular genetics and genomics to study problems in developmental biology and physiology. I have have studied the pathways by which microRNAs and other small RNAs regulate the translation of messenger RNAs as well as other gene expression mechanisms. My lab is now using functional genomic and genetic strategies to systematically discover the components of the RNAi and microRNA pathways in C. elegans. Using full genome RNAi screens to reveal RNAi and miRNA pathway components, they have recently identified many genes that positively or negatively regulate RNAi and microRNA pathways. Most of the genes identified in these screens are conserved across eukaryotic phylogeny, suggesting universality of these small RNA pathways. Some of these components may be developed as drug targets to enhance RNAi in mammals, a technical improvement that may be necessary to elevate a laboratory tool to a therapeutic modality. Over the past decade, my lab discovered that like mammals, C. elegans uses an insulin signaling pathway to control its metabolism and longevity. Their molecular genetic analysis revealed an insulin-like receptor signaling cascade to the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor. This analysis has revealed conservation of molecular mechanisms at many steps in the pathway, suggesting that insulin regulation of longevity and metabolism is ancient and universal. Our lab then showed that insulin signaling in the nervous system is key to lifespan. Functional genomic analyses using RNAi libraries of every C. elegans gene now allows a systematic study of metabolism and aging. Our lab has surveyed the 18,000 genes for their action in regulation of longevity, fat deposition, and molting. This analysis gives a global view of the molecular machines that operate in these pathways. These gene lists reveal the many steps in energy regulation, including metabolic enzymes that store and mobilize fat, as well as hormonal signals from fat stores to satiety centers in the brain. A neuroendocrinology of energy balance and longevity is emerging from these studies.In my lab I use C. elegans molecular genetics and genomics to study problems in developmental biology and physiology.

VMy research centers on dynamical systems, their applications to the physical and social sciences, and the development of new research tools motivated by dynamics. In the physical sciences I work on the Newtonian N-body problem by examining all possible ways N-body systems can evolve as time goes to infinity, the dynamic behavior of collisions and singularities, and the kinds of configurations the particles can form as determined by the integrals of motion and symmetry considerations. My recent research emphasizes dynamics in the social sciences, such as the properties of price mechanisms, equilibrium concepts such as the core, evolutionary models, and in particular, decision analysis. As an illustration of the latter, as known since 1770, an election outcome can reflect the procedure rather than the voters' preferences. By developing tools motivated by chaotic systems and symmetry concepts we now can analyze all possible standard voting and decision procedures. This includes discovering a benign interpretation for the seminal Arrow Theorem while extending it. A next goal is to extend these approaches so they can address decision problems coming from such areas as statistics, management, and engineering.My research centers on dynamical systems, their applications to the physical and social sciences, and the development of new research tools motivated by dynamics.

VAs a virologist and immunologist, my research focuses on comparative aspects, including the zoonotic potential, of enteric and respiratory viruses (coronaviruses, rotaviruses and caliciviruses) of food animals and humans. A related focus is mucosal immunity to these viruses and vaccine development. Our laboratory discovered the gut-mammary immunologic axis, a new concept leading to recognition of a common mucosal immune system in animals and humans. We exploited this concept to design vaccination approaches to prevent enteric viral infections of neonates. We continue to elucidate the immunologic interrelationships, T and B cell memory responses and maternal antibody impact among distinct mucosal tissues to devise new vaccine strategies for neonates. A current emphasis is on bioengineering of rotavirus-like-particle vaccines with immunomodulators to prevent rotavirus diarrhea, a leading cause of morbidity in young animals and mortality in infants.  Our lab discovered, characterized and developed novel cultivation methods and diagnostic assays for new fastidious enteric viruses including group C rotavirus, a bovine torovirus and porcine and bovine enteric caliciviruses. Using our recently developed infectious viral clones, we are pursuing the genetic basis for in vitro replication and in vivo virulence of enteric caliciviruses. This research should unlock new avenues of investigation for uncultivable human caliciviruses, leading causes of food-borne illness worldwide.

VAs a molecular biologist, I have studied the replication and transcription mechanisms using the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi29 as a model system. The phage DNA, about 19kb long, has a protein covalently linked at the two 5' ends, the so-called terminal protein (TP). Phage phi29 replication starts at both DNA ends by a mechanism in which a free molecule of the TP acts as a primer to incorporate the first nucleotide to the OH group of a specific serine residue, catalyzed by the phage DNA polymerase, giving rise to the initiation product, TP-dAMP. Then, the same DNA polymerase catalyzes elongation producing unit length phi29 DNA in a highly processive way, coupling polymerization to strand displacement. Using the phi29 TP, DNA polymerase, the double-strand DNA binding protein p5 and the single-strand DNA binding protein p6, small amounts of phi29 TP-DNA have been amplified in vitro over 1000-fold. The amplified DNA was fully infective. Because of its properties, phi29 DNA polymerase has been used as a tool for amplification of both circular and linear DNA. I have also studied the control of phi29 DNA transcription. Early genes are transcribed from several promoters recognized by the host RNA polymerase, whereas late genes are transcribed from a single promoter that requires, in addition, the phage regulatory protein p4 and the DNA binding protein p6. These two proteins are also repressors of some of the early promoters. More recently, I have also worked on the role of host proteins, among them the actin-like cytoskeleton proteins, in phi29 DNA replication.As a molecular biologist, I have studied the replication and transcription mechanisms using the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi29 as a model system.

More recently, I have also worked on the role of host proteins, among them the actin-like cytoskeleton proteins, in phi29 DNA replication.As a molecular biologist, I have studied the replication and transcription mechanisms using the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage phi29 as a model system. The phage DNA, about 19kb long, has a protein covalently linked at the two 5' ends, the so-called terminal protein (TP). Phage phi29 replication starts at both DNA ends by a mechanism in which a free molecule of the TP acts as a primer to incorporate the first nucleotide to the OH group of a specific serine residue, catalyzed by the phage DNA polymerase, giving rise to the initiation product, TP-dAMP. Then, the same DNA polymerase catalyzes elongation producing unit length phi29 DNA in a highly processive way, coupling polymerization to strand displacement. Using the phi29 TP, DNA polymerase, the double-strand DNA binding protein p5 and the single-strand DNA binding protein p6, small amounts of phi29 TP-DNA have been amplified in vitro over 1000-fold. The amplified DNA was fully infective. Because of its properties, phi29 DNA polymerase has been used as a tool for amplification of both circular and linear DNA. I have also studied the control of phi29 DNA transcription. Early genes are transcribed from several promoters recognized by the host RNA polymerase, whereas late genes are transcribed from a single promoter that requires, in addition, the phage regulatory protein p4 and the DNA binding protein p6. These two proteins are also repressors of some of the early promoters. More recently, I have also worked on the role of host proteins, among them the actin-like cytoskeleton proteins, in phi29 DNA replication.

VMy primary research interests are the study of criminal behavior over the life course, neighborhood effects on well being, and the social structure of cities.  I have sought to provide new ways of measuring and conceptualizing community-level mechanisms related to collective efficacy, civic engagement, social disorder, and other emergent processes.  To support this inquiry my colleagues and I have developed survey and video-based approaches to "eco-metric" measurement.   Current applications involve multi-level models of how concentrated racial inequality is produced and its social consequences for both individual lives and neighborhood dynamics.   This work stems from the "Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods," for which I serve as Scientific Director.  I have also been engaged for 2 decades on a longitudinal study from birth to death of 1,000 disadvantaged men born in Boston during the Great Depression era.  Two books from this project-Crime in the Making: Pathways and Turning Points Through Life (1993) and Shared Beginnings, Divergent Lives: Delinquent Boys to Age 70 (2003), provide a long-term analysis of continuity and change in multiple life domains.  A central finding is that the prospective ability of childhood factors to predict trajectories of adult development is much weaker than commonly believed.My primary research interests are the study of criminal behavior over the life course, neighborhood effects on well being, and the social structure of cities.

VAs an economist, my main area of interest has been public economics, i.e. the study of the economic effects of taxation and public expenditure and the interaction between the private and public sectors of the economy. Problems that I have been especially concerned with include the evaluation of public investment projects, the effects of taxes on labor supply, saving and risk-taking, and the determinants of tax evasion and the hidden economy. I have also worked on the problem of optimal taxation, studying how the tax system should be designed with regard to economic efficiency and income distribution. In terms of the application of economic theories to specific problems of policy, I have written on the economics of the welfare state and on environmental economics; the latter area includes the study of the use of economic incentives, in particular "green taxes", to prevent environmental degradation as well as problems related to the global environment. A general perspective that underlies much of my research in this area is the uncertainty aspects of economic decision-making: The need to take into account that economic agents make decisions about saving, investment and production without full knowledge of the consequences of their actions. In recent years I have also worked on various aspects of the history of economic thought.As an economist, my main area of interest has been public economics, i.e. the study of the economic effects of taxation and public expenditure and the interaction between the private and public sectors of the economy.

VMy colleagues and I study the formation of the synapses that interconnect nerve cells, because these are the main sites at which the nervous system processes and (in all likelihood) stores information. One set of studies uses the nerve-muscle synapse to identify the developmentally important signals that the pre- and post-synaptic partners exchange as they form, modify, and maintain their connections. This work, much done in collaboration with the late John Merlie, involves identifying signaling molecules and their receptors using simplified systems, and then testing their roles by targeted gene disruption in mice. A second set of studies explores the issue of synaptic specificity: how growing axons choose the appropriate target cell from among the many neurons they encounter. This work uses the vertebrate visual system, because so much is already known about its adult pattern of connectivity and function. A final set of studies, done in collaboration with Jeff Lichtman, aims to devise novel transgenic methods for visualizing synapse formation and synaptic circuits in live animals over time. By using these methods we are learning how the molecules identified in the first two projects actually exert their cellular effects.My colleagues and I study the formation of the synapses that interconnect nerve cells, because these are the main sites at which the nervous system processes and (in all likelihood) stores information.

In recent years I have been interested in the spectral problems at the center of the modern theory of automorphic forms and harmonic analysis. These have applications to classical number theory, for example, to the theory of zeta functions and Hilbert's problem on the arithmetic of quadratic forms as well as to combinatorics and computer science using constructions of highly connected but sparse networks. These spectral problems also give one of the few instances of quantizations of classically chaotic Hamiltonians than can be studied mathematically in the semiclassical limit.I work in the mathematical fields of number theory and analysis and their applications.

VI am interested in all areas of molecular electrochemistry and electron transfer chemistry: systematic investigation of reaction mechanisms in organic and coordination electrochemistry; homogeneous and homogeneous-supported (redox polymers) catalysis of electrochemical reactions under its redox and chemical (including enzymatic) aspects; catalysis of chemical reactions by electrons from an electrode mostly in the field of nucleophilic substitutions; dynamics of electron hopping in assemblies of redox centers (percolation and diffusion); effect of molecular superstructures on the thermodynamics and kinetics of electron transfer and ligand exchange reactions; theory of the dynamics of dissociative electron transfer; application to proton transfer; application to the determination of bond energies; factors governing concerted and stepwise mechanisms in reactions where electron transfer and bond breaking are coupled; triggering of radical or ionic chemistries by single electron transfer; and electrochemistry of unstable free radicals. These various studies have progressively built a general understanding of the relationships between single electron transfer and chemical reactivity. The knowledge thus acquired on electrochemical grounds has been transferred to many other fields of chemistry: organic, inorganic, organometallic, organo-fluorine, bioorganic, bio-inorganic, enzymatic catalysis, material science, (soft) solid state ionics, and electronics.I am interested in all areas of molecular electrochemistry and electron transfer chemistry: systematic investigation of reaction mechanisms in organic and coordination electrochemistry; homogeneous and homogeneous-supported (redox polymers) catalysis of electrochemical reactions under its redox and chemical (including enzymatic) aspects; catalysis of chemical reactions by electrons from an electrode mostly in the field of nucleophilic substitutions; dynamics of electron hopping in assemblies of redox centers (percolation and diffusion); effect of molecular superstructures on the thermodynamics and kinetics of electron transfer and ligand exchange reactions; theory of the dynamics of dissociative electron transfer; application to proton transfer; application to the determination of bond energies; factors governing concerted and stepwise mechanisms in reactions where electron transfer and bond breaking are coupled; triggering of radical or ionic chemistries by single electron transfer; and electrochemistry of unstable free radicals.

VThe major portion of my research has concerned the masses of galaxies and clusters of galaxies and the distribution of matter -- dark and luminous -- within them.  For the past decade I have been studying the gravitational mirages produced by galaxies and clusters of galaxies using ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope.  These mirages permit the mapping of matter even when it is invisible.  Early on in my career Bill Press and I developed a simple model for the formation of clusters of galaxies that, despite gross simplifications, seems to reproduce the observed distribution of cluster masses and its evolution with time.  Somewhat mysteriously, the functional form predicted for the distribution of cluster masses also gives an excellent empirical fit to the distribution of galaxy luminosities.  In the past few years an appreciable fraction of my time has been devoted to measuring the wavefront errors in the images delivered to the focal plane of the Magellan telescopes in Chile.  The error signals are used to keep the primary mirrors strictly parabolic and to keep the secondary mirrors in position, and will soon be used to compensate for the corruption of images by the Earth's atmosphere.The major portion of my research has concerned the masses of galaxies and clusters of galaxies and the distribution of matter -- dark and luminous -- within them.

VI have devoted the bulk of my career to building mathematical models that shed light on a variety of economic and social phenomena such as economic fluctuations, the nature of oligopolistic competition, the growth of cities, informal economic activity, and the spatial distribution of crime. I have also developed new statistical tools for analyzing economic and financial data. Recently, I have been particularly interested in asset prices. With Lars Hansen, I have been building tools to study long-run risks in financial markets. With colleagues at the Bendheim Center of Finance at Princeton University, I have studied the role of disagreement on the precision of information, together with the costs related to short-selling, in sustaining asset-price bubbles and the associated excessive trading. We have also proposed analogous models concerning the emergence and implosion of bubbles.I have devoted the bulk of my career to building mathematical models that shed light on a variety of economic and social phenomena such as economic fluctuations, the nature of oligopolistic competition, the growth of cities, informal economic activity, and the spatial distribution of crime.

VI investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of membrane organization and transport in eucaryotic cells. The initial focus of my laboratory was on the mammalian nerve terminal, where we defined a set of proteins critical for the release of neurotransmitters. These proteins were the founding members of families of molecules responsible for membrane fusion events throughout the cell and in all organisms from yeast to man. We are now investigating molecular processes that regulate the specificity and timing of membrane fusion events. This regulation is accomplished by a diverse set of proteins and lipids including GTPases and molecular chaperones. Our ultimate goal is to understand the role of membrane trafficking events in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, a mechanism of learning and memory.I investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of membrane organization and transport in eucaryotic cells.

VAs an ecologist I have studied how the communities and biogeochemical cycles of lakes respond to human-imposed stresses, largely using whole-lake experiments in boreal lakes. By adding various combinations of nitrogen and phosphorus we were able to deduce that most lakes are limited by phosphorus and are capable of resolving shortages of nitrogen and carbon by enhancing long-term uptake from the atmosphere. In later acidification experiments we found that the communities and biogeochemical processes of lakes were affected at pH values as high as 6.0, ten-fold less acidic than previously thought. Much of the lakes' alkalinity was generated by internal microbial processes rather than solely by geochemical weathering. Data from long-term reference lakes allowed us to determine the effects of climate warming on lakes. More recently I have begun work on alpine lakes, removing stocked alien salmonid fishes and restoring native species that were extirpated by alien fishes. We have also studied the inputs of PCBs and pesticides to remote alpine and arctic lakes, where cold temperatures, high precipitation, and inputs from melting glaciers combine to leave fishes contaminated to levels that may affect fish-eating predators, including humans.As an ecologist I have studied how the communities and biogeochemical cycles of lakes respond to human-imposed stresses, largely using whole-lake experiments in boreal lakes.

VSince the beginning of my scientific career, I have been interested in the circulation of the chemical elements in natural ecosystems-now widely known as biogeochemistry. Most of my work has focused on soils, especially on the carbon stored in soils, which contain a major pool in the global carbon cycle. My early work provided estimates of the storage of organic carbon (humus) and inorganic carbon (largely calcium carbonate) in soils, losses of soil carbon to runoff, changes in soil carbon with conversion of land to agriculture, and accumulations of carbon during soil development. More recently, I have examined changes in soil processes and soil carbon storage that will accompany plant growth at elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, as simulated in the Duke Forest Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. My work also evaluates recommendations for carbon sequestration as a means to control the accumulation of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere and to mitigate the potential for global warming. In addition to my studies of soil carbon, I have provided a budget summarizing the sources of atmospheric ammonia and a synthetic compilation of the global boron cycle. My approach, philosophy, and much of my other work is summarized in my textbook, Biogeochemistry: an analysis of global change, available in its second edition through Academic Press/Elsevier, San Diego.Since the beginning of my scientific career, I have been interested in the circulation of the chemical elements in natural ecosystems-now widely known as biogeochemistry.

VIn the last 25 years, I have been investigating the intracellular signaling pathways that are regulated by polypeptide growth factors. Growth factors mediate their biological responses by binding to and activating cell surface receptors designated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). RTKs play an important role in the control of the cell cycle, cell migration, and metabolism, as well as cell proliferation and differentiation. It has been shown that mutations or dysfunctions in the action of RTKs can cause severe diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and many developmental disorders. Through detailed biochemical and structural studies, my laboratory has established the mechanism of action of these receptors and how they transmit their intracellular signals. Receptor activation results in recruitment of signaling proteins via specific protein modules that direct protein:protein interactions such as Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. Each activated receptor functions as a platform for the assembly of a particular repertoire of signaling proteins. The enzymatic activities and cellular localizations of signaling proteins are regulated by their SH2, SH3, PTB, PH, and other protein modules. These proteins coordinate and link between intracellular signaling pathways that were activated by RTKs.In the last 25 years, I have been investigating the intracellular signaling pathways that are regulated by polypeptide growth factors.

VAs a graduate student at Harvard University, I developed the Expanding Photosphere Method to measure the distances to a class of exploding stars called Type II Supernovae. This method was used to measure distances on an absolute physical scale, and to measure a value of the Hubble constant of 73 +/-9 km/s/Mpc. In 1994 I co-founded and led the High-Z SN Search Team, an international collaboration of more than 20 astronomers on five continents, with the purpose to study the evolution of the Universe with Type Ia supernovae. In 1998 our team, simultaneously with a competing team, provided strong evidence that the Universe is accelerating in its expansion. This acceleration can be best explained by some sort of Dark Energy which pervades and dominates the other forms of matter in the Universe. Since 1998 I have been chasing Gamma Ray Bursts, helping determine the angle associated with GRB jets, helping develop the connection between GRBs and type Ic supernovae, and identifying the likely progenitors of at least some Short Hard Bursts. Starting in 2003, I have been working on a program to undertake a comprehensive survey of the Southern Skies, using the widefield SkyMapper telescope. This new generation telescope will commence regular operations in the second quarter of 2009, and will be a unique facility in the southern hemisphere for mapping the night time sky with unprecedented accuracy. This facility will enable cutting edge research across the breadth of astronomy and astrophysics, allowing my colleagues and me, to undertake research on topic ranging from the outer solar system to the distant Universe.As a graduate student at Harvard University, I developed the Expanding Photosphere Method to measure the distances to a class of exploding stars called Type II Supernovae.

VAll chemical reactions pass through an energetic barrier called the transition state, where the probability of return to reactants and conversion to products is equal. We know little about transition states since their lifetimes are on the time scale of a single bond vibration. Despite these difficulties, the systematic application of kinetic isotope effects, together with computational approaches, can define the chemical nature of transition state structures. Our interests are in analysis of transition state structures for enzyme-catalyzed reactions using the process we call transition state analysis. The molecular electrostatic features of enzymatic transition states are established and used to design analogues of enzymatic transition states. Mimics of enzymatic transition states capture the catalytic power of enzymes and covert it into ligand binding energy to create powerful inhibitors. We have solved the transition state structures of drug target enzymes and have synthesized some of the most powerful known enzymatic inhibitors. Several of these are in clinical trials for human diseases. Application of transition state theory to targeted enzymes has the potential to revolutionize drug design. A related interest of the laboratory is binding isotope effects. This method reports on bond electronic distortion as ligands bind to receptors. In summary, we strive to understand details of enzymatic catalysis and to apply those to inhibitor design.All chemical reactions pass through an energetic barrier called the transition state, where the probability of return to reactants and conversion to products is equal.

VTrained in chemistry and physics my early research interests were in the theory of intermolecular forces, in particular in hydrogen bonds and ion-water interactions, which are important for understanding the structure of biomolecules. During my post-doc years my research interests shifted towards evolution at the molecular level. Together with Manfred Eigen I conceived and developed the theory of quasispecies and hypercycles. Work on in vitro and in silico evolution of RNA molecules initiated research on RNA sequence-structure relations. Systematic studies revealed the importance of neutrality - several sequences fold into the same minimum-free-energy structure - and lead to the invention of neutral networks as a useful tool for understanding RNA sequence-structure mappings and designing RNA sequences that form predefined structures. The exploration of suboptimal conformations and folding kinetics led to the development of algorithms for the design of RNA switches that were successfully tested experimentally. The collection of our tools for RNA structure prediction and analysis was made openly accessible as the Vienna-RNA-package. More recently we applied our knowledge on dynamical systems to gene regulatory and metabolic networks and developed new tools for network analysis and reverse engineering based on conventional and inverse methods for analysis and modeling by means of differential equations.Trained in chemistry and physics my early research interests were in the theory of intermolecular forces, in particular in hydrogen bonds and ion-water interactions, which are important for understanding the structure of biomolecules.

The exploration of suboptimal conformations and folding kinetics led to the development of algorithms for the design of RNA switches that were successfully tested experimentally. The collection of our tools for RNA structure prediction and analysis was made openly accessible as the Vienna-RNA-package. More recently we applied our knowledge on dynamical systems to gene regulatory and metabolic networks and developed new tools for network analysis and reverse engineering based on conventional and inverse methods for analysis and modeling by means of differential equations.

VThe interplay between fundamental and applied quantum physics is the theme of my research. For example, the quantum nature of light limits the purity of laser radiation. We developed a quantum description of laser behavior yielding the photon statistics of laser light. This theory also describes the single-atom maser and laser and provides insight into phase transition critical phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation. I then extended the theory to show how properly (i.e., coherently) prepared atoms can suppress spontaneous emission noise (correlated emission laser), or stimulated absorption (lasing without inversion). As an application of these studies we have built new kinds of lasers that operate without population inversion and phase coherent media that slows the group velocity of light to a few tens of meters per second. These studies hold promise for new high-precision magnetometers and gyroscopes. In related work we have shown how quantum optics can shed new light on the mysterious ways of the quantum, specifically, how erasing information in one part of the universe can change how we look at things in another. This strange quantum eraser process has been observed in the real (surreal?) quantum world.The interplay between fundamental and applied quantum physics is the theme of my research.

VThe center of my interest is Organic Synthesis and Stereochemistry. Originally, we have worked in the field of synthetic methodology involving sulfur-, selenium-, fluoro-, nitroso-, and nitro-organic compounds, as well as organometallic derivatives of Li, Si, Sn, Ti, and Zr. The X-ray crystal structures of Li-enolates, of Li-dithianes and of other Li-derivatives were determined, and the importance of their aggregation was recognized. Early on, we also employed enzymes and microorganisms for the preparation of enantiomerically pure compounds (EPC). The TADDOLs were invented and became a general chiral auxiliary system in the broadest sense of the word. Techniques for electrolysis, for carrying out reactions on preparative scale at temperatures down to -150 degree Celsius, and for immobilizing chiral ligands for organometallic reagents on controlled-pore glass were invented. Other fields of research have been chiral dendrimers, and the biopolyesters PHB/PHA. Concepts and terms such as umpolung, "chiral pool", meso-trick, EPC synthesis, sterically protected but electronically effective functional groups, self-regeneration of stereocenters, like/unlike have first been used in papers published by our group. Most recently the world of Beta- and Gamma- peptides was explored; they consist of homologated proteinogenic amino acids. Within less than ten years Beta-peptides have evolved as a totally new class of unnatural peptidic oligomers with most surprising chemical and biological properties and with applications in medicinal chemistry.The center of my interest is Organic Synthesis and Stereochemistry.

VDrs. Jonathan and Christine Seidman have elucidated genetic causes of human disorders affecting calcium homeostasis (familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe hypoparathyroidism), hearing (sensorineural deafness, Bjornstad syndrome), tooth patterning and most importantly heart disease (cardiomyopathy, congenital malformations). The Seidman's discoveries include demonstration that cardiac myosin heavy chains, alpha-tropomysin, cardiac troponin T and cardiac myosin binding protein-C mutations cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,therein establishing a heretofore "idiopathic" condition as a contractile machinery disease.  Their work has also uncovered the genetic basis for dilated cardiomyopathy and includes definition of mutations at distinct sites in contractile protein genes, and in titin, phospholamban and lamin A/C, and EYA4.  Their findings improve diagnosis and through genotype/phenotype relationships provide prognostic information and aid sudden death risk stratification.  The Seidmans also discovered the first genetic cause of congenital heart malformations, defining mutant transcription factor genes (TBX5, NKX2-5) in Holt-Oram syndrome and isolated heart malformations. The laboratory has also engineered many of these human mutations into mouse genomes and delineated biophysical properties of mutant sarcomeres and biochemical consequences of phospholamban and TBX5 defects.  These investigations of cellular responses have identified critical roles for altered calcium homeostasis in cardiomyopathy, therein linking pathogenic mechanisms in inherited and acquired heart failure, work that provides a framework for design of rational therapies.  Investigations of congenital heart disease models have reshaped classical paradigms from embryologic lineage to transcriptional regulation, work that that also indicates critical transcription factor levels for normal heart development.Drs.

VWe have cloned and characterized hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. HIF-1 expression increases exponentially as cellular O2 concentration declines. HIF-1 is required for embryonic development of the circulatory system. In postnatal life, HIF-1 activates the transcription of genes that are essential for adaptive responses to hypoxia, such as glycolysis, erythropoiesis, and angiogenesis. We are presently investigating the role of HIF-1 in the pathophysiology of cancer and cardiovascular disease, which are the major causes of mortality in the U.S. population. We have demonstrated that aging and diabetes inhibit HIF-1 activity, thereby blocking ischemia induced angiogenesis. We have constructed an adenoviral vector encoding a constitutively active form of HIF-1 and demonstrated that it can stimulate vascularization of ischemic tissue and thereby overcome the effects of aging and diabetes. We have identified several drugs that potently inhibit HIF-1 activity and block the growth and vascularization of human tumor xenografts in nude mice. Clinical trials to test these agents in cancer patients are currently being organized.We have cloned and characterized hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor.

VAs a geologist, I am interested in the elucidation of the processes involved in the growth and structuration of the continental lithosphere. To that end, I have studied the history of now-vanished oceans. One of these oceans, the Tethys, formed the present Alpine-Himalayan mountain ranges. From a study of the Tethys, I learned that continental collision can disrupt the colliding continents, thereby creating such diverse structures as large extensional troughs (called rifts) and major strike-slip faults; additionally, the architectural style of the collisional mountain range depends on the size of the vanished ocean. Following up the latter discovery, my group has shown that much of central and north Asia is made up of material offscraped during the closure of another large ocean leading to significant continental growth 600 to 150 million years ago. The architectural style that evolved as a consequence was typical of the oldest pieces of the continental crust formed and structured some 3.5 billion years ago. I have also studied the relationships of rifting to mantle processes from the viewpoint of identifying unequivocal geological fingerprints of the latter, using mainly the East African rifts system as an example.As a geologist, I am interested in the elucidation of the processes involved in the growth and structuration of the continental lithosphere.

VMy research has been broadly based in the field of organometallic chemistry, with special emphasis on the synthesis of organometallic compounds, their characterization, studies of their reactivity and their applications, mainly in organic synthesis and materials chemistry.  My students have prepared synthetically useful vinylic and allylic organolithium reagents by the transmetalation reaction, as well as acyllithium reagents by the reaction of alkyllithiums with carbon monoxide at -110 degrees C or below.  Our phenyl(bromo-dihalo-methyl)mercury reagents proved to be clean sources of free dihalocarbenes, CX2, under mild and neutral conditions and allowed a broad development of dihalocarbene chemistry that was not possible with the then available CX2 sources.  In the alkylidyne tricobalt nonacarbonyl tetrahedral cluster complexes in which carbon is in an unusual environment, we developed some unusual organic chemistry including the generation of very stable alpha-carbenium and alpha-acylium ions which owed their stability to interactions with the cobalt atoms of the cluster.  Our study of the chemistry of mu-dithiodiiron hexacarbonyl showed this complex to be an inorganic mimic of organic disulfides and led to our discovery of the versatile mu-carbonyl-mu-alkylmercapto-diiron hexacarbonyl anions which we found to be potent iron-centered nucleophiles.  In the area of organosilicon chemistry, we prepared and isolated the first very strained and highly reactive silacyclopropanes and silacyclopropenes and found hexamethylsilacyclopropane to be a useful dimethylsilylene source under mild thermal conditions.My research has been broadly based in the field of organometallic chemistry, with special emphasis on the synthesis of organometallic compounds, their characterization, studies of their reactivity and their applications, mainly in organic synthesis and materials chemistry.

VI am an observational seismologist interested in both earthquakes and what seismic waves tell us about the inside of the Earth.  Although I have enjoyed working on a diversity of projects, they usually share a common theme-the mining of large seismic data sets to learn new things about the Earth.  In global seismology, I have studied upper-mantle discontinuity properties, scattering from small-scale structures, and seismic attenuation.  In particular, I have applied stacking (averaging) methods to improve signal-to-noise ratios and make visible features in the waveforms that are not obvious on single records, such as weak reflections from mantle discontinuities.  In southern California, my work has focused on improving micro-earthquake locations and focal mechanisms using robust methods and waveform cross-correlation.  More recently, my colleagues and I have experimented with back-projection methods to image earthquake ruptures, such as the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and Parkfield earthquakes.  Stacking methods have also proven useful in performing comprehensive analyses of spectra from thousands of earthquakes to resolve stress drop and other source properties.I am an observational seismologist interested in both earthquakes and what seismic waves tell us about the inside of the Earth.

In global seismology, I have studied upper-mantle discontinuity properties, scattering from small-scale structures, and seismic attenuation.  In particular, I have applied stacking (averaging) methods to improve signal-to-noise ratios and make visible features in the waveforms that are not obvious on single records, such as weak reflections from mantle discontinuities.  In southern California, my work has focused on improving micro-earthquake locations and focal mechanisms using robust methods and waveform cross-correlation.  More recently, my colleagues and I have experimented with back-projection methods to image earthquake ruptures, such as the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman and Parkfield earthquakes.

VAs an experimental elementary particle physicist, I study particle collisions at the highest manmade energies. Since higher energy translates into improved spatial resolution, we are able to probe inside nuclear matter and investigate the basic interactions among the constituents of nature. At the Fermilab collider, we are studying the properties of the top quark, nature's most massive constituent, which we discovered a decade ago. The top quark, alone among the elementary particles, interacts strongly with the source of particle mass. Consequently, the top quark mass is an essential component of a precision test of the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions. We recently published the most precise measure of the mass of the top quark and are now working to further improve the precision. I also work on designing electronic systems for reconstructing, within microseconds, the trajectories of the particles produced in a collision. We are using data collected with such a system at Fermilab to search for the production of new types of particles. We are also developing a much more powerful system for use at the CERN LHC.As an experimental elementary particle physicist, I study particle collisions at the highest manmade energies.

VMy research focuses on development of chemical tools for the study of protein and lipid kinases in cellular signaling. These enzymes are the central elements in signal transduction pathways which govern all cellular decisions-many cancers are caused by mutations in protein and lipid kinases. We have developed a strategy to selectively perturb any kinase in the genome using a combination of protein engineering and organic synthesis. Using protein engineering to modify the active site of a single kinase, allows differentiation of the kinase of interest from all other kinases. Then, through synthesis of small molecules (substrates or inhibitors) which are incapable of binding to wild-type enzymes, but which specifically bind to the engineered kinase active site, we are able to specifically trace the substrates or functions of over 100 protein kinase in a diverse array of organisms. The term "chemical genetics" has been coined to capture the use of both small molecule chemistry and genetics to specifically target a single enzyme. Recently we have applied the tools of chemical genetics toward understanding growth factor signal transduction including PI3-kinase, Akt, and mTOR regulation in normal and cancer settings. We have uncovered a surprising level of integration within growth factor signaling pathways such as feedback and feedforward loops which either reinforce or counteract the effects of inhibiting single enzymes in the pathway. Our current efforts are to develop chemical ways of short-circuiting such feedback loops to make better drugs to treat cancer.My research focuses on development of chemical tools for the study of protein and lipid kinases in cellular signaling.

VMy major research interests in neurobiology are the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of the nervous system and its repair after injury. Studies of the regulation of nerve cell death in development by nerve growth factor (NGF) led to the isolation and characterization of the NGF protein and its two structurally unrelated receptors and of the signaling pathways that inhibit cell death and promote axon growth. In nerve cells in the brain the packaging and trafficking of NGF and other neurotrophins in vesicles underlies their activity and neurotrophin-dependent release at nerve terminals and their ability to modify nerve cell morphology. Studies of nerve regeneration have identified apolipoprotein E as a key factor in the storage and reuse of lipid in regenerating peripheral nerve and peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) as a protein in compact peripheral myelin. The discovery that mutations in, or duplications of, the gene for PMP22 cause the major demyelinating diseases of the peripheral nervous system has led to new insights into the mechanisms of myelination and demyelination. Mutations in PMP22 interfere with its trafficking in Schwann cells, cause varying degrees of aggregation, and upset the normal assembly of proteins in myelin, producing unstable myelin. Recent data suggest that the signaling of one neurotrophin through its receptors is essential for myelination.My major research interests in neurobiology are the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of the nervous system and its repair after injury.

VAs a computer scientist I have worked on the design and analysis of algorithms, including algorithms for combinatorial and geometric problems. For the last decade I have been working on quantum computation. I showed that it was possible to use a quantum computer, a hypothetical machine that exploits the properties of quantum mechanics, to factor large numbers efficiently, and thus break the widely used Rivest-Shamir-Adelman cryptosystem. I subsequently showed that it was possible to design quantum-error-correcting codes that protect quantum information from decay and decoherence, and that these could be used to design fault-tolerant circuits for a quantum computer, dramatically reducing the tolerances required to build such a computer. Recently, I have been working on quantum information theory, trying to analyze how much information can be transmitted over a quantum channel. Unlike the classical case, for which there is essentially only one capacity given by the formula of Shannon, in the quantum case the capacity depends on whether the information to be transmitted is classical or quantum, and what auxiliary resources are available.As a computer scientist I have worked on the design and analysis of algorithms, including algorithms for combinatorial and geometric problems.

VAs a physician and clinical physiologist I have been interested in understanding the regulation of glucose and fat metabolism in humans and its dysregulation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To this end my group has developed several magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods to non-invasively examine intracellular glucose and fat metabolism in humans. Using these methods we have demonstrated that defects in insulin stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis, due to defects in insulin stimulated glucose transport, is the major factor responsible for insulin resistance in patients with T2DM. Using 13C MRS we developed a method to directly assess net hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in humans and found that increased hepatic gluconeogenesis is the major factor responsible for fasting hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM. My group has gone on to delineate the mechanism responsible for insulin resistance in liver and skeletal muscle, which we hypothesized can be attributed to increases in diacylglycerol, which in turn activates nPKCs leading to decreased insulin signaling at the level of the insulin receptor kinase. We showed that this mechanism can explain insulin resistance in both obese T2DM patients as well as in patients with severe lipodystrophy. My group has also developed MRS methods to non invasively assess mitochondrial function and demonstrated that decreased muscle mitochondrial function is associated with increased intramyocellular triglyceride content and that it may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Most recently, we have shown that hyperinsulinemia, resulting from primary defects in insulin stimulated muscle glycogen synthesis, results in increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis leading to atherogenic dyslipidemia and non alcoholic fatty liver disease in young lean individuals who are prone to develop the metabolic syndrome. Currently, we are testing and validating these hypotheses in transgenic and gene knockout mouse models of insulin resistance and identifying novel therapeutic targets to reverse insulin resistance in patients with T2DM.As a physician and clinical physiologist I have been interested in understanding the regulation of glucose and fat metabolism in humans and its dysregulation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

VAs a statistician interested in probability theory, I focus my research on statistical problems that arise in concrete scientific applications and require novel probability theory for their resolution. Until 1985 my research was primarily in sequential analysis, especially problems of the design and analysis of sequential clinical trials. A related interest was sequential "change-point" detection, motivated by problems of monitoring a continuous production process for changes that can only be inferred from noisy measurements on its output. This led to several years of research on a variety of change-point-like problems and related problems of nonlinear regression, which have found a wide variety of applications. Recently I have concentrated on statistical aspects of genetic mapping (i.e., the identification of the location of genes giving rise to phenotypes such as diseases in humans or mammalian model organisms, desirable quantitative traits in agriculturally important plants and domestic livestock). From the modern viewpoint of a "genome scan" based on hundreds of mapped markers to search for anonymous genes, genetic mapping is very similar to change-point problems with the location of the gene as change-point. I have also used techniques developed to study change-point problems to give approximate p-values for gapped pairwise local sequence alignments.As a statistician interested in probability theory, I focus my research on statistical problems that arise in concrete scientific applications and require novel probability theory for their resolution.

VThe first part of my career was devoted to Condensed Matter Physics and included studies of dynamics near phase transitions, high temperature superconductors; and nonlinear dynamics, pattern formation and turbulence in fluids. In the mid 90's I began working on biological problems, initially in Biophysics dealing with the mechanical properties of single DNA molecules when pulled and twisted along with polymer aspects of chromosome structure. Some physical chemical problems posed by protein trafficking in cells were treated with Lippincott-Schwartz at NIH. When the yeast genome became available I developed algorithms to analyze the regulatory sequence on a genome scale. These methods were extended to the early patterning of the fly embryo. With Fred Cross I extended the scope of time lapse imaging for budding yeast and quantified aspects of cell cycle transitions that are invisible to population based assays. Most recently I have developed in-silico methods for gene network evolution and applied them to aspects of vertebrate morphogenesis. These methods also furnish minimal dynamic models for nontrivial patterning problems with the property that parameters can be optimized by simple gradient descent. I am collaborating with several laboratories to generate the requisite quantitative data.The first part of my career was devoted to Condensed Matter Physics and included studies of dynamics near phase transitions, high temperature superconductors; and nonlinear dynamics, pattern formation and turbulence in fluids.

VMy research interests concern the theory of several complex variables, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry, especially problems in their interfaces. I have worked on the theory of extending analytic objects, such as meromorphic maps and coherent analytic sheaves, across subvarieties or pseudoconcave boundaries and have described the structure of closed positive currents in terms of subvarieties. I introduced Bochner-Kodaira techniques to harmonic maps to develop the theory of geometric strong rigidity and super-rigidity of Kahler and Riemannian manifolds. I apply the estimates of the complex Neumann problem and the theory of multiplier ideal sheaves to algebraic geometry to study and resolve conjectures such as the deformational invariance of the plurigenera and to obtain effective results such as the effective multiple needed for an ample line bundle to be very ample or for its adjoint bundle to be globally generated. I use function-theoretical and algebraic geometric techniques to investigate and solve problems in value distribution theory and the theory of hyperbolicity in complex geometry.My research interests concern the theory of several complex variables, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry, especially problems in their interfaces.

VAs a historically oriented social scientist, I probe the ways in which political conflicts and public policies are shaped at the intersection of social structures and governmental institutions.  In early comparative-historical research, I probed the roots of social revolutions in peasant societies governed by monarchies or colonial authorities, and sought to explain why, despite reformist hopes for liberal outcomes, such revolutions resulted in more centralized authoritarian regimes.  Over the past two decades, I have developed an innovative explanation for the distinctive patterning and sequencing of social welfare and public insurance programs in the nineteenth and twentieth-century United States compared to Western Europe; and I have also analyzed the roots and consequences of repeated abortive efforts to establish national health insurance in the United States.  My research group on Civic Engagement in American Democracy has documented the growth and transformation of U.S. voluntary associations and interest groups from 1790 to the present, with special emphasis on the shift from membership-based to professionally managed organizations that occurred after 1960.  Currently, I am studying the impact of U.S. social programs and higher education policies on equality and opportunity and, more broadly, launching a systematic analysis of the challenges and opportunities faced by public sector reformers responding to economic crisis and political realignment in the emerging Obama era compared to the New Deal of the 1930s and 1940s.As a historically oriented social scientist, I probe the ways in which political conflicts and public policies are shaped at the intersection of social structures and governmental institutions.

VBruce D. Smith's research centers on the interactions between past human societies and their environments - particularly the spatial patterning of settlements and subsistence activities on ancient landscapes and human utilization, manipulation, and modification of biotic communities. His research often considers major episodes of change at a regional scale of analysis. In the 1970s Smith focused on the Mississippian Period (A.D. 1000-1400) chiefdoms of eastern North America - their overall subsistence patterns, how river valley landscapes and resource distribution shaped settlement patterns and community organization, and how Mississippian societies initially developed. Smith's research interests expanded In the 1980s to encompass the earlier (ca. 3,000 B.C.) transition in eastern North America from a hunting-and-gathering way of life to food production economies based on indigenous domesticated plants. In the 1980s and 1990s, Smith carried out a number of field and collections-based studies of the eastern domesticates, and documented that the region was an independent center of plant domestication. He also developed a general model for the spatial organization and subsistence systems of Hopewellian societies of the region, which by 300 B.C. to A.D. 200 had well developed and regionally variable food production economies. Dr. Smith's research expanded again in the mid-1990s to encompass the origins of agriculture world-wide and the initial domestication of plants and animals from both archaeological and biological perspectives. Currently he is interested in integrating biological and archaeological approaches to documenting plant and animal domestication and exploring the conceptual and developmental middle ground between hunting-gathering and agriculture.Bruce D.

VEnvironmental economics studies the effects that environmental systems have on the positive predictions and normative recommendations of economic models. My research has investigated how people's constraints, the information, circumstances governing the availability of environmental resources, and characteristics of environmental resources influence what can be learned about people's values for changes in these resources. It considers both use and existence values for them. The former arises from in situ activities, such as outdoor recreation. The latter concerns a preference to sustain specific natural assets independent of any prospects for direct use. This research has helped to establish that systematic measures can be derived for the tradeoffs people make in their housing choices, job decisions, recreational activities, and other behaviors to acquire enhancements in the environmental services. It also indicates that reliable tradeoff measures can be recovered from stated choices to enhance these resources.Environmental economics studies the effects that environmental systems have on the positive predictions and normative recommendations of economic models.

VI am a geophysicist and a student of the inner workings of Earth-like planets and their manifestations at planetary surfaces. For the Earth itself my principal investigative tool has been seismology, with which I have pursued the nature of the processes that form new crust at mid-ocean ridges, the evolution and state of stress of the lithosphere, and the seismic-velocity signatures of mantle convective flow beneath sites of sustained surface volcanism. For the other inner planets I have used spacecraft observations of surface deformation, volcanism, topography, and gravity to address parallel questions, guided by the goal--far from yet realized--of achieving a general understanding of how Earth-like planets form and evolve. I am presently wrestling to fit new observations of Mars' internal structure, crustal magnetization, and volcanic and fluvial histories into a coherent description of interior differentiation and cooling. I am also leading the planning and design of the first mission to make orbital geochemical, geological, and geophysical observations of Mercury.I am a geophysicist and a student of the inner workings of Earth-like planets and their manifestations at planetary surfaces.

VAs an epidemiologist I employ longitudinal observational and case-control studies to identify potential etiologic agents of disease. Observational field studies in Indonesia revealed that children with mild vitamin A deficiency died at significantly higher rates than better-nourished peers. Randomized clinical trials, involving tens of thousands of preschool children proved that vitamin A supplementation reduced subsequent infectious mortality by at least one-third, particularly from measles and diarrheal disease. Vitamin A supplementation of children already hospitalized with severe measles reduced their case fatality rate by half. More recently, we have shown that vitamin A supplementation of pregnant women in deficient populations reduces maternal mortality by 40 percent. The exact mechanisms responsible for these benefits remain uncertain. We are presently studying the optimal combination of multiple micronutrient supplements. Vitamin A deficiency control programs are now in place in over 70 countries. When fully operational they should save the sight and lives of 2 million young children and women every year.As an epidemiologist I employ longitudinal observational and case-control studies to identify potential etiologic agents of disease.

VI am interested in the mechanisms by which viruses invade cells, partricularly herpes simplex virus. Five of the viral envelope glycoproteins participate in viral entry into cells. We showed that the initial interaction of virus with cell is usually the binding of viral glycoproteins gB or gC to heparan sulfate chains on cell surface proteoglycans. In the years since, many other viruses and other microbes have been found to bind to heparan sulfate, a ubiquitous cell surface carbohydrate. Attachment of herpes simplex virus to heparan sulfate is not sufficient for entry. Entry requires the binding of a specific viral glycoprotein, gD, to any one of several different cell surface receptors, which we identified by expression cloning. The expression and distribution of these various gD receptors determine susceptibility of the cell to viral entry. Viral entry occurs by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. This fusion is triggered by the binding of gD to a gD receptor and requires the action of three other viral glycoproteins. Structure-function studies of the viral glycoproteins, entry receptors, and other cellular components will lead to an understanding of the mechanism of viral entry.I am interested in the mechanisms by which viruses invade cells, partricularly herpes simplex virus.

VI am an anthropological archaeologist interested in the cultural evolution of complex societies. I have combined aspects of biological evolutionary theory with concepts from social and political anthropology to construct models of the evolution of chiefdoms (societies with centralized but not internally specialized leadership) and states (societies that are governed by centralized and internally specialized bureaucracies). I have applied these models to archaeological data that Dr. Elsa Redmond, my wife and collaborator, and I have recovered in Mexico and Venezuela. In Barinas, Venezuela, we documented that chiefdom society appeared around A.D. 600 in a context of demographic growth and increasing competition for prime agricultural land in our study region, at the interface between the llanos (savanna grasslands) of the Orinoco Basin and the Andean piedmont. In Mexico, we have spent the past three decades investigating the rise of the early Zapotec state, which emerged around 300 B.C. with its capital at Monte Alban in the Oaxaca Valley. Our research indicates that the evolution of an internally-specialized government here was closely linked to a dramatic shift in the prevailing warfare strategies that Monte Alban's rulers pursued, from sporadic raids to long-term territorial conquests. We have shown that this early state's pattern of territorial growth was markedly asymmetric, as Monte Alban initially extended its control into certain distant regions occupied by relatively weak polities, and only later turned its attention to closer areas with stronger polities which had managed to resist, for a while, incorporation into the early Monte Alban state.I am an anthropological archaeologist interested in the cultural evolution of complex societies.

VAs an astrophysicist, I have been interested in using astronomical observations to probe fundamental physics. My early work focused on the physics of the dark matter and neutrino astrophysics. During the past decade, much of my work has focused on using observations of the cosmic microwave background as a tool to study the properties of the early universe. I have played a leading role in the analysis and interpretation of data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We found that a simple cosmological model with only a handful of parameters (the age of the universe, the density of atoms, the density of matter, the amplitude of initial fluctuations and its scale dependence, and the epoch of the formation of the first stars) could fit not only the microwave background data but a host of other astronomical observations. I have also been interested in the dynamics and structure of our Galaxy and developing astronomical instrumentation to detect extrasolar planets.As an astrophysicist, I have been interested in using astronomical observations to probe fundamental physics.

VI have studied the transcriptional basis of energy metabolism in mammalian systems. One of our major efforts has been to decipher the transcriptional basis of adipogenesis. This has identified the nuclear receptor PPAR gamma as a dominant regulator of fat cell differentiation and insulin sensitivity. Further work has also shown a role for this receptor in differentiation and growth of other cell types, including many epithelial cells involved in human cancer. These studies have led to clinical trials for the use of PPAR gamma ligands in several forms of human cancer. Our studies have also shown that there is important regulation of metabolism at the level of the transcriptional coactivator. PGC-1 stimulates a switch toward a more oxidative state in many tissues, including brown fat-mediated thermogenesis, muscle fiber-type switching, and many aspects of the fasted liver, including hepatic gluconeogenesis. PGC-1 is induced in liver by hormones that induce gluconeogenesis and this coactivator activates the entire program of glucose production.I have studied the transcriptional basis of energy metabolism in mammalian systems.

VPhysics has made remarkable strides in understanding carefully isolated systems. It has done less well when there are many components to a system and they interact nonlinearly. Here, dynamics and statistics are linked very closely. Only broad features can be predicted deterministically-and that only for a short time-while most other features can be understood only statistically. We understand well the statistical laws governing equilibrium systems, critical phenomena being the most celebrated example. But we know less well the laws obeyed by systems driven far from equilibrium. Such systems abound in physics, engineering, biology, economics as well as sociology. There are hints of universality to aspects of their behaviors, though this is distinctly different from that of equilibrium systems. An important question is whether these hints of universality can stand rigorous and quantitative scrutiny. Using fluid turbulence as example, and motivated by the possibility of observing common features in nearby fields in condensed matter, soft matter, geophysics, astrophysics and so forth, I have attempted to characterize-experimentally, numerically, and sometimes also analytically-the properties of systems driven far from equilibrium. On the end of applications, I am interested in energy and the environment, including mathematical modeling. I am much interested in science and science policy in developing countries.Physics has made remarkable strides in understanding carefully isolated systems.

VMy research interests range from physical-organic to supramolecular chemistry and self-assembly. I developed vinyl(enol)triflate chemistry, which is now widely used by synthetic, materials, and inorganic chemists in Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of importance in the synthesis of natural products, new materials, and tectons in self-assembly. I have generated and studied vinyl cations and extended unsaturated carbenes, which are novel members of the family of carbocations and carbenes, two of the most important and ubiquitous intermediates in organic chemistry. I have exploited alkynyliodonium species as "electrophilic" acetylene equivalents and used them to prepare hitherto unknown acetylenic esters: alkynyl carboxylates, phosphates, and sulfonates. In connection with my current interest in supramolecular chemistry and self-assembly I have developed, systematized, and exploited a general methodology for the self-assembly of discrete supramolecular species with well-defined shapes and sizes based on coordination and dative metal-ligand bonds. This is an alternative paradigm to nature's hydrogen bonding for the self-assembly of large (nm) highly symmetrical ensembles of significance in nanotechnology and materials science. Metallacyclic polygons and polyhedra--such as nanoscale molecular squares, hexagons, truncated tetrahedra, cuboctahedra, and dodecahedra--have been self-assembled with this paradigm. I am investigating the catalytic, host-guest, and molecular recognition properties of these new ensembles.My research interests range from physical-organic to supramolecular chemistry and self-assembly.

VHere are two principal threads of my research.  This is hardly all inclusive, but represents what I think I am best known for. I have tried to make this slightly understandable to non-mathematicians (at the cost of not mentioning some of my favorite results! My work on the Brauer-Siegel theorem is probably the biggest omission.)-Harold Stark. My research in number theory covers analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, transcendence theory and modular forms. Perhaps my principal interest is to apply analytic methods to obtain algebraic results.  An algebraic number field is a generalization of the rational numbers.  A quadratic field occurs when every number in the field satisfies a quadratic equation.  If the roots of all these equations are real, the field is a real quadratic field; otherwise the field is a complex quadratic field. Inside a number field is an analogue of the ordinary integers: the algebraic integers of the field.  Ordinary integers have the property that every integer is uniquely expressible as plus or minus one times a product of primes.  Gauss conjectured that there are precisely nine complex quadratic fields whose integers have unique factorization.  I gave in 1967 the first complete accepted proof of this conjecture. This result was obtained from a study of the value at s=1 of analytic objects, the zeta and L-functions attached to complex quadratic fields.  Over a period of two decades, this led to the "Stark Conjectures", which relate the values at s=1 over a general field k to algebraic numbers in a corresponding field extension of k.  Some fascinating instances of this conjecture allow us to numerically generate class fields from the values of L-functions. More than one computer number theory package now generates certain class fields in this way.Here are two principal threads of my research.

VMy general area of research is observational cosmology, with particular interest in the process of galaxy formation and the nature of the intergalactic medium. Whereas the large-scale structure of the universe is dictated primarily by dark matter, the behavior of the normal, baryonic matter embedded in the dark-matter structure is what shapes the observable universe.  These baryonic processes are very complex, and relatively poorly understood.  By using spectroscopic observations of objects at high redshifts, we attempt to observe directly the most important cosmic epochs as they are happening. Such observations are used to reconstruct the history of galaxies, and the reservoir of diffuse gas between the galaxies, over a large fraction of the age of the universe.  We are interested in measuring key physical parameters of galaxies such as mass, chemistry, large-scale spatial distribution, and the impact of energetic processes such as black hole accretion, star formation, and supernova explosions on their environments in the young universe. Most of this work is conducted using large ground-based telescopes operating at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, and includes participation in the development of state-of-the-art instrumentation.My general area of research is observational cosmology, with particular interest in the process of galaxy formation and the nature of the intergalactic medium.

VMy primary research interest is in the mechanisms and regulation of DNA and chromatin duplication during the cell division cycle. Initially by investigating the mechanism and control of simian virus 40 DNA replication in primate cells and more recently studying chromosomal inheritance in human and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, my goal has been to understand how genetic and epigenetic information is copied before cell division. My laboratory has identified the cellular proteins that function to replicate the DNA and is studying how they work together and how they are controlled during the cell division cycle. Of particular interest are the proteins that recognize chromosomal origins of DNA replication and then form a competent protein complex for initiation of DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle. Such proteins determine when and where chromosome replication starts. We have also discovered proteins that participate in the inheritance of chromatin and of epigentically determined states of gene expression, processes that influence cell differentiation during development. Some of these proteins function both in the inheritance of DNA and in the inheritance of chromatin, thereby linking these two important cellular processes.My primary research interest is in the mechanisms and regulation of DNA and chromatin duplication during the cell division cycle.

VMy research as an economist has two components.  On the technical side I have developed and integrated recursive methods for analyzing dynamic models of individual behavior.

VMy hope is to identify and solve mathematical problems that arise in applications like signal processing and the solution of partial differential equations. Often those problems involve linear algebra. As an example, the wavelet transform has the valuable property that it is executed by a banded matrix that has a banded inverse. Both the transform and its inverse are then "local" and the time domain description of the signal remains visible (in comparison with the Fourier transform). A natural question is to identify all banded matrices with this exceptional property that the inverse is also banded (which makes the transforms fast). In this and many other applications, the underlying problem is "the choice of a good basis." My contribution is to identify the properties that make a basis good, to construct good ones, and to analyze the discrepancy between a continuous problem (in function space) and a corresponding discrete problem that uses the chosen basis.My hope is to identify and solve mathematical problems that arise in applications like signal processing and the solution of partial differential equations.

VI am fascinated by how biological processes are encoded in folded atomic structures of proteins. To understand transmembrane signaling we determined the first profile structures of the neuromuscular activating acetylcholine receptor. To define mechanisms of transport across membranes we determined the first atomic structure for an Aquaporin, a water and glycerol channel GlpF, the water channel AqpZ, and now for several other Aquaporins and organic conducting channels. We defined the mechanism by which the 'signal recognition particle' complexes with its receptor to ensure correct delivery of a nascent membrane protein, to the membrane. We showed how colicin Ia enters bacteria and forms transmembrane ion channels. To understand transmembrane signaling we showed how the cytokine 'erythropoietin' signals by making a 1:2 erythropoietin-receptor complex, successfully mimicked in a de novo designed protein. We derived mechanisms of several enzyme paradigms, including trypsin, its activation from trypsinogen, isocitrate dehydrogenase and showed how it is regulated by phosphorylation. In structures of HIV-1 and KSHV protease, HIV integrase we elaborated key principles for how drugs act, and can be made to evade drug resistance mutations. 54 publications on thymidylate synthases provide the most defined picture of any two substrate enzyme.I am fascinated by how biological processes are encoded in folded atomic structures of proteins.

VI started doing experiments because I was fascinated by the question of how neurons in the brain communicate to process sensory information and transform it into a motor response. It was clear from the very beginning that understanding this question required insight into the molecular machinery that underlies synaptic transmission, the process by which a signal is transferred at a synapse. At a synapse, a presynaptic neuron signals to a postsynaptic cell (usually another neuron) by secreting a chemical neurotransmitter that is then recognized by the postsynaptic cell. Our work has focused on how presynaptic neurons secrete neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter secretion is triggered by calcium in an unusually fast and tightly regulated reaction and is positioned precisely in front of the postsynaptic cell by virtue of a transsynaptic cell-adhesion apparatus. In dissecting neurotransmitter secretion we have identified molecular mechanisms that mediate the calcium control of secretion and couple it to the postsynaptic cell. These initial results provide a platform for deciphering the complete machinery that integrates the molecular components of synapses into a functional "minicomputer" for information processing by the brain, a question I am very interested in pursuing.I started doing experiments because I was fascinated by the question of how neurons in the brain communicate to process sensory information and transform it into a motor response.

VMy interests include the mechanisms of infection, spread, replication, pathogenesis, and clearance of hepadnavirus infections. This family of viruses causes persistent infection of hepatocytes, maintained by a small number of viral DNA episomes in the nuclei of infected cells. Viral episomes produce new DNA copies in the cytoplasm by reverse transcription of an RNA form of the genome, and these DNA genomes are persistently secreted into the blood as enveloped infectious viruses. I have developed and used two animal virus models of the human hepatitis B virus for my studies: the woodchuck hepatitis virus, and the duck hepatitis B virus. My current research aims to describe hepadnavirus infection in these animal models at the level of the individual cell, and to follow viral and cell dynamics during chronic infection, during the emergence of variants, and during the clearance of acute infections.My interests include the mechanisms of infection, spread, replication, pathogenesis, and clearance of hepadnavirus infections.

VThe common theme of the research in my laboratory is an attempt to understand the genetic basis by which form and structure are regulated during vertebrate development. Investigations, using both the chick and mouse as model systems, investigate this problem on a variety of levels, from the early patterning of developmental fields to the cellular events of organogenesis. For example we have studied limb development from the perspective of the establishment of anterior-posterior, proximal-distal and dorsal-ventral positional information, and connected those early axial patterns to later specification of tendons, muscles, joints within the skeletal element and differential bone growth. Similarly we have major efforts directed towards understanding left-right asymmetry from the initial breaking of symmetry through a cascade of signals, to cellular changes directing the asymmetric looping of the primitive tube. Other studies have focused on formation of the heart valves and patterning of the axial structures derived from the somites.The common theme of the research in my laboratory is an attempt to understand the genetic basis by which form and structure are regulated during vertebrate development.

VMy colleagues and I study the mechanism of circadian rhythms in vertebrates. Circadian rhythms are of interest because they represent an evolutionarily conserved adaptation to the environment that can be traced back to the earliest life forms and because in animals circadian behavior can be analyzed as an integrated system - beginning with genes leading ultimately to behavioral outputs. Initially, our work focused on the localization of circadian oscillators in nervous systems of birds and mammals. Then, led to a more mechanistic study of how these oscillators functioned by isolating them in vitro. The key breakthroughs in the field however came from genetics and the identification of 'clock genes' first in Drosophila and Neurospora. In the last decade, we have used the mouse as a tool for the discovery of genes that control circadian behavior. In work with William F. Dove, my colleagues and I used a phenotype-driven mutagenesis strategy to isolate the first circadian rhythm mutant in the mouse (named Clock). This led to the identification of the Clock gene by a combination of transgenic "rescue" and positional cloning. These experiments revealed that Clock encoded a novel member of the basic-helix-loop-helix - PAS family of transcription factors. In subsequent work, we found that CLOCK and its partner BMAL1 act as the positive elements of a transcriptional feedback loop that generates circadian oscillations. The primary targets of CLOCK are the Period and Cryptochrome genes which comprise the negative feedback elements of the oscillator. Recently, we have continued to use genetics to dissect circadian behavior and have extended this approach to other types of complex behaviors.My colleagues and I study the mechanism of circadian rhythms in vertebrates.

VI have been studying the mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion, which are fundamental to the construction of the animal body. In the earliest stages of my research, I found that cell-cell adhesion involves distinct Ca2+-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Subsequently, I identified a group of transmembrane proteins involved in the Ca2+-dependent mechanism, which was subsequently termed "cadherin." Our studies demonstrated that cadherin plays a key role in connecting cells as well as in various morphogenetic phenomena in animal development. We also identified Drosophila cadherins, providing evidence that the cadherin family and its functions are conserved among animal species. Our neurological studies showed that cadherin is also important for the formation, stability, and functions of synapses. Another interest of my laboratory is to understand the mechanisms of how cell-cell adhesion is regulated. By identifying alpha-catenin, a cytoplasmic protein associated with cadherin, we could show that cadherin co-operates with the catenins for cell junction formation and that, in many cancer-derived cells, this cadherin-catenin system is disrupted, leading us to propose that defects in the cadherin-based adhesion machinery may facilitate the dispersion of cancer cells. Our current studies include disclosing the biological functions of the large superfamily of non-classic cadherins, by which we expect to find novel cell-cell interaction mechanisms.I have been studying the mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion, which are fundamental to the construction of the animal body.

VMy research career in Immunology began with the original identification of two cytokine genes and their characterization between the late 1970s and early 1980s, namely, the genes encoding human fibroblast interferon (now known as IFN-b) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). The molecular identification of the products of these and other cytokine genes, carried out by us and many others, made it possible to study their functional properties and elucidate their intracellular signaling mechanism as well as their physiological regulation. These initial studies have led us to further extend the characterization of these cytokine systems in the context of the regulation of immunity and oncogenesis. One of our major contributions is the discovery and characterization of a new family of transcription factors, termed interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Our current research interests are aimed at clarifying the function and regulation of the IRF family of transcription factors in oncogenesis and immunity. In addition, we also focus on the mechanism of signaling and transcription networks elicited by IFN-a/b and other cytokines, important in the immune responses to pathogens and cancer.My research career in Immunology began with the original identification of two cytokine genes and their characterization between the late 1970s and early 1980s, namely, the genes encoding human fibroblast interferon (now known as IFN-b) and interleukin-2 (IL-2).

Perhaps the one unifying theme behind these diverse subjects is that the analysis often hinges on understanding the dichotomy between structured behavior (which can be studied algebraically or geometrically) and random or pseudorandom behavior (which can be studied with more analytic techniques, such as those from probability theory.My main interests are in mathematical analysis; whether it be the study of linear and nonlinear waves, or counting patterns in sets such as the prime numbers, or understanding how one can efficiently recover signals from incomplete and noisy data, or to control the behavior of random matrices.

VMy main area of investigation has been the molecular mechanisms of the movements of cells. My laboratory has studied how the hydrolysis of ATP by an enzyme could generate force and motion. Using striated muscle, the best material for determining the relationship of molecular structure and mechanics to an enzyme mechanism, we developed a model for the contraction cycle based on the kinetic mechanism of the actomyosin ATPase cycle. The discovery of kinesin, a motor that moves organelles along microtubules, presented a new problem: Is the molecular mechanism of the microtubule-kinesin system the same as that of the actomyosin system? The two motors, myosin and kinesin, were found to have important structural features in common, but our kinetic analysis showed that they followed different reaction pathways.  I have recently become interested in a different kind of motile system, one in which the polymerization of actin and tubulin produces force and motion. We are investigating the dynamic mechano-chemical properties of the cytoskeleton, using the techniques that were developed in the study of motor proteins.My main area of investigation has been the molecular mechanisms of the movements of cells.

VShelley Taylor studies social relationships and how they protect against stress. She especially focuses on the biological benefits of social support, such as reduced neuroendocrine, sympathetic, neural, and immune responses to stress and better health. Her tend-and-befriend model, which was developed in response to the fight-or-flight metaphor that usually guides stress research, builds on the fact that, in response to stress, people come together with others for joint protection of self and offspring; this tendency to affiliate in response to stress is somewhat more true of women than men. The biological underpinnings of these responses appear to depend on the oxytocin, vasopressin, and endogenous opioid peptide systems. Professor Taylor also conducts research on self-regulation, stress, and coping, and identifies the skills that people develop and use for anticipating stressful events and for minimizing their adverse effects and when they do occur. She has especially addressed how people proactively head off stressful events through planning, goal setting, and mental simulation. Finally, Taylor studies how positive beliefs are protective of health. She shows that positive illusions, including beliefs that center on optimism, self-enhancement, and an illusion of control, have mental and physical health benefits.Shelley Taylor studies social relationships and how they protect against stress.

VMy research interests include general relativity, theoretical astrophysics, and computational physics. My earliest work led to the development of an equation that describes how a black hole interacts with surrounding objects (the so-called "Teukolsky equation"). My subsequent research has included the physics of pulsars and supernova explosions, properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars, stellar dynamics, and planets around pulsars. My most current project uses supercomputers to study colliding black holes. I am part of a world-wide effort trying to solve Einstein's equations of general relativity with computers. The goal of this effort is to predict the gravitational waves emitted by two orbiting black holes that spiral together and coalesce. Such a wave will likely be among the first signals detectable by the new gravitational wave detectors like LIGO that are becoming operational. For the first time theory and observation will confront each other in the limit of ultrastrong gravity and highly warped spacetime.My research interests include general relativity, theoretical astrophysics, and computational physics.

VMy research is centered on our discovery and use of the mass independent fractionation process for stable isotopes and the concomitant applications. A portion of our work involves understanding the quantum level physical chemical mechanisms of the process. The specific nature of the isotopic partitioning process has provided a novel means by which transition state phenomena may be probed and quantified. We have applied measurements of these unique isotopic signatures to natural samples, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial. These studies include: The origin and evolution of the solar system from both meteorite measurements and molecular beam experiments as well as returned samples of the solar wind; definition of the source and transformation of greenhouse gases in the troposphere; chemistry of the stratosphere and mesosphere from rocket borne collections, especially the ozone cycle; the chemistry of the ancient Martian atmosphere; the origin and evolution of oxygen-ozone and life in the Earth's Precambrian; the history of sea water over million year time scales; and, the change of the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere from ice core sample collection and analysis from the Antarctic and Greenland. Paleo measurements have lead to new understanding of impacts of events upon the atmosphere and its chemistry over time, such as volcanoes and asteroidal impacts.My research is centered on our discovery and use of the mass independent fractionation process for stable isotopes and the concomitant applications.

VMy early research was directed primarily towards understanding how the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes the formation of tumors on plants. Along with my colleagues, I found that a small portion of the Agrobacterium genome, the T-DNA, is transferred into the plant cells where it is integrated into the nuclear genome and the genes that it encodes become expressed. Further studies established that two genes carried on the T-DNA encode enzymes mediating the synthesis of auxin, a potent plant hormone that has a key role in stimulating cell proliferation. More recently, research in my laboratory has focused on understanding the mechanisms that plants have evolved to tolerate abiotic stresses. Most of our effort has centered on the cold acclimation response, the process whereby certain plants increase in freezing tolerance in response to low, nonfreezing temperatures. We have recently described a small family of regulatory and target genes in Arabidopsis, comprising the CBF cold response pathway, which is activated at low temperature and has a central role in cold acclimation and freezing tolerance. The goals of our current research are to determine the nature of the molecular "thermometer" that controls expression of the CBF pathway and to construct a low-temperature gene "wiring diagram" that identifies the transcription factors and gene regulons with critical roles in life at low temperature.My early research was directed primarily towards understanding how the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes the formation of tumors on plants.

VAs a statistical scientist, my research interest has always been the development of models and methods of inference from genetic data on related individuals within a species. These relationships may either be the known pedigree relationships of family studies or members of genetic isolates, or the unknown relationships of members of larger populations. While much of my work has been focused on human populations, I have also had a long-term interest in the role of pedigree and population structure in maintaining genetic variation in small populations of endangered plants and animals. Modern genomic data make it increasingly possible to infer coancestry of segments of our genomes, and model-based inferences from multiple genomes allow new approaches to old questions ranging from analyses of long-term genetic differentiation of widely dispersed populations, to short-term extinction of genes in the small population of a highly endangered species; from inference of genealogical relationships among individuals to inference of the genetic basis of traits from data observed on members of a known pedigree; and from analyses of patterns of genome sharing from the meiosis process in plants to modern methods for human genetic linkage analysis.As a statistical scientist, my research interest has always been the development of models and methods of inference from genetic data on related individuals within a species.

Modern genomic data make it increasingly possible to infer coancestry of segments of our genomes, and model-based inferences from multiple genomes allow new approaches to old questions ranging from analyses of long-term genetic differentiation of widely dispersed populations, to short-term extinction of genes in the small population of a highly endangered species; from inference of genealogical relationships among individuals to inference of the genetic basis of traits from data observed on members of a known pedigree; and from analyses of patterns of genome sharing from the meiosis process in plants to modern methods for human genetic linkage analysis.

VMy aim is to understand how a cell maintains or changes identity and to understand what limits the repertoire of identities that a particular cell can become. I use human embryonic (ES) stem cells as a model system because their unlimited proliferative capacity and developmental potential make them uniquely suited for exploring these themes in human material. In the early 1990s my laboratory derived ES cells from the macaque and marmoset, work that led to the derivation of human ES cells. Much of the initial work in my laboratory after that derivation was establishing human ES cells as an accepted, practical model system, and we developed improved culture conditions, methods for genetic manipulation, and approaches for the in vitro differentiation to key lineages of clinical importance. With human ES cells now firmly established as a practical model system, we are currently focused on using these tools to understand the basic biology of pluripotency. We use several conditions that induce uniform differentiation to specific lineages to study in detail how ES cells decide to exit the pluripotent state and become restricted in their potential, and study methods for reprogramming differentiated cells back to a pluripotent state.My aim is to understand how a cell maintains or changes identity and to understand what limits the repertoire of identities that a particular cell can become.

VThe goal of my research is to understand biological processes at the molecular level, by studying protein structures and sequences using computational approaches. Initially as more protein three-dimensional structures were determined, our work involved the collection, description and classification of these beautiful structures and their component motifs, to elucidate the principles governing their folding and evolution. We developed computational tools to compare, validate, analyze and predict structures, leading to a better understanding of the relationship between sequence and structure, and a classification scheme for protein families based on their structures. This includes detailed analyses of the interactions of proteins with other molecules in the cell from a structural perspective with the goal of improving rational drug design. More recently we have focused on functional analysis, exploring how structure determines function and how proteins families evolve to perform novel functions. For example, during evolution many enzymes have been duplicated and evolve to perform new reactions or the same reaction but on different substrates.  The structures reveal how this is achieved providing the foundation to understand the mechanisms for the evolution of function. With completed genome sequences, we can extend such studies to consider the evolution of pathways and even organisms.The goal of my research is to understand biological processes at the molecular level, by studying protein structures and sequences using computational approaches.

VMy long-term research has focused on microbial ecology, especially the physiology, diversity, and function of microbes in their natural or managed habitats. In the first part of my career I worked on microbial processes in soil, especially those affecting the nitrogen cycle and pesticide decomposition. This led to extensive work on denitrification and microbial transformation of environmental pollutants, especially the reductive dechlorination of many of the serious environmental pollutants, e.g. PCBs, DDT, chloroaromatics, chlorosolvents. While these processes have important practical implications for environmental clean-up, this work has also led to the isolation of a number of unusual anaerobic microbes that live by new bioenergetic process, halorespiration, i.e. they gain energy from the exothermic dechlorination process. When molecular methods became available, I used these methods to explore in greater breadth and depth the unknown microbial world. My interests now lie in linking microbial community structure with function, in understanding how microbes are patterned with their environment, and in using genomics to more fully understand microbial diversity, speciation, endemism and adaptation to their in situ conditions. In particular, I'm using genomics help understand halorespiration and how the Burkholderiacea, common soil microbes, can adapt so well to very different habitats such as soil, the plant rhizosphere, degrade pollutants and be pathogenic on some plants, animals and in cystic fibrosis patient's lungs.My long-term research has focused on microbial ecology, especially the physiology, diversity, and function of microbes in their natural or managed habitats.

VI am an experimental and theoretical ecologist interested in biological diversity; the controls of ecosystem composition, stability and productivity; and the long-term implications for society of human impacts on global ecosystems. I am intrigued by the processes that have led to the evolution of the immense number of species that live on Earth, by the mechanisms that allow these species to persist and coexist, and by the effects of this biological diversity on ecosystem functioning.  I rarely start a field experiment except to test predictions of theory and rarely pursue a topic theoretically unless its importance has been suggested by results of field experiments. I am using large-scale, long-term, well-replicated field experiments and mathematical theory to explore (1) the effects of the loss of plant biodiversity on ecosystem stability, productivity, nutrient dynamics, and trophic structure; (2) effects of chronic nitrogen deposition on ecosystem diversity, composition, and functioning; and (3) mechanisms controlling the assembly, composition, and diversity of ecosystems. I am deeply interested in the applications of and communication of science to society. I enjoy collaborating with scholars in other disciplines to pursue such issues as the evolution of ethics, agricultural sustainability, and insights from the parallels between economics and ecology.I am an experimental and theoretical ecologist interested in biological diversity; the controls of ecosystem composition, stability and productivity; and the long-term implications for society of human impacts on global ecosystems.

VMy research interests lie in macromolecular chemistry. I was trained as a polymer chemist, and began my career by working on the kinetics and mechanisms of polymerization reactions and polymer modification processes. When recombinant DNA methods became widely available in the 1980s, I began to explore the use of artificial genes to direct the synthesis of novel, well-defined macromolecules in bacterial cells. This approach to macromolecular synthesis allowed the polymer chemist, for the first time, the opportunity both to design a new structure and then to prepare that structure with essentially absolute control of the molecular architecture. Our initial targets were artificial proteins that form crystals, liquid crystals and gels of predetermined, programmable properties. More recently, we have focused on materials for use in surgery and regenerative medicine, the use of artificial amino acids to prepare proteins that behave in unusual ways, the evolution of proteins of novel composition, and the development of new approaches to the analysis of protein synthesis in cells.My research interests lie in macromolecular chemistry.

VMy primary research interest is the generation, distribution, and effects of the solar magnetic field throughout the Sun's interior and outer atmosphere. This research has largely been experimental and has involved development of new instrumentation for use on the ground and in space. Using spectral imaging techniques we can map both horizontal and vertical flows in the solar interior and surface. Flow maps have shown among other things how the solar interior rotates as a function of radius. This profile is essential for any understanding of interior magnetic field generation - dynamo action. Magnetic fields can be measured in the photosphere and inferred in the interior and outer atmosphere. Using these techniques it has been discovered that magnetic field emerges everywhere on the solar surface at a rate sufficient to completely replace the fields outside of active regions in less than a day, and even active region fields are replaced in at most a few weeks. The energy associated with the observed rate of replacement of field is sufficient to heat the Corona and Chromosphere. The detailed mechanisms by which magnetic energy is released is currently the focus of my research.My primary research interest is the generation, distribution, and effects of the solar magnetic field throughout the Sun's interior and outer atmosphere.

VGlauco P. Tocchini-Valentini has worked for over forty years in the field of molecular biology. His early scientific contributions include the demonstration that genetic transcription is an asymmetric process. Using alpha-DNA, the genome of a bacteriophage isolated from Tiber's waters, he showed that only one strand of DNA is copied for each unit of transcription. He then utilized tritiated precursor-induced suicide to isolate three sets of temperature-sensitive mutants blocked in DNA, RNA and protein syntheses, respectively. At the end of the Sixties, he contributed to the isolation and characterization of both RNA and DNA polymerases of Xenopus laevis, the isolation of the full transcript of the rDNA cistron (a possible template for the synthesis of amplified DNA) and the discovery of TypeII DNA topoisomerase. More recently, the study of RNase P and tRNA splicing endonuclease from Xenopus germinal vesicles led him to contribute to understanding the rules governing enzyme-substrate interactions and the determination of cleavage sites in tRNA precursors. The latter work has led to a general scheme for targeting of individual mRNAs in eukaryotes. He has coordinated the coordination and establishment of the A. Buzzati-Traverso International Campus, in Monterotondo (Rome), with CNR\u2019s new core infrastructures of the European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA) and Mouse Clinic, in collaboration with the leading international biomedical research institutions. The integrated Monterotondo infrastructures are devoted to the systematic and standardized production, primary phenotypic analysis, archiving and world-wide dissemination of novel mutant models of human diseases and operate in the context of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) global initiative.Glauco P.

VI am interested in understanding the chemistry and physics of particles in the atmosphere. These particles may influence atmospheric chemistry and climate not only on the present day Earth, but also on the planets and throughout Earth's history from the dawn of time. Our initial studies focused on measuring heterogeneous reactions on ice and nitric acid/ice surfaces representative of polar stratospheric clouds. We found that these icy clouds catalyzed reactions that convert inert chlorine compounds into more active forms capable of destroying stratospheric ozone. We now recognize that such reactions are an important step in the mechanism for formation of the yearly Antarctic "ozone hole." We have also studied heterogeneous reactions on sulfuric acid surfaces to probe the role of volcanic aerosols in global ozone depletion. In addition to measuring heterogeneous reactions, we have probed the nucleation and ultimate composition of the polar stratospheric cloud particles. Knowledge of cloud formation processes will ultimately help predict future cloud abundances and ozone levels in an environment where chlorine compounds are decreasing due to world-wide regulation, but polar stratospheric clouds may be increasing due to declining stratospheric temperatures because of climate change. Our current work emphasizes the role of chemically complex tropospheric aerosols in regulating current and future climate. We probe how particles with mixed compositions nucleate and grow to sizes where they impact visibility and radiation directly, and perhaps indirectly by modifying clouds. In addition, we are investigating the properties of particles that might have been present early in Earth's history to help constrain the climate and atmospheric chemistry under which early life on Earth developed. We are also studying the properties of particles on Mars and Titan (a moon of Saturn), which may be parallels to particles on Earth now and in the distant past.I am interested in understanding the chemistry and physics of particles in the atmosphere.

VMy research is focused on theoretical astrophysics, in particular the dynamics of a wide range of astrophysical systems, including planetary rings, comets, planetary systems, galactic nuclei, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. With Goldreich I studied many of the major dynamical processes in planetary rings and successfully predicted the existence of satellite-driven density waves in Saturn's rings and shepherd satellites that maintained the sharp-edged narrow rings of Uranus. I predicted the existence of the Kuiper belt outside Neptune as the source of Jupiter-family comets and showed that the production of new comets is predominantly determined by the influence of the Galactic tide on the Oort comet cloud. Much of my current research concerns the structure and properties of the dark matter that dominates the mass of galaxies. I am also a member of a collaboration that has used the Hubble Space Telescope to find strong evidence of massive black holes in the centers of many nearby galaxies.My research is focused on theoretical astrophysics, in particular the dynamics of a wide range of astrophysical systems, including planetary rings, comets, planetary systems, galactic nuclei, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies.

VMy research is in theoretical and computational physical chemistry with special emphases on reaction dynamics and quantum mechanics. I have studied the quantum mechanical, semiclassical, and classical treatment of chemical reactions and energy transfer processes and new methods for molecular modeling. We have spent considerable effort developing variational transition state theory and multidimensional tunneling methods for calculating reaction rates, algebraic variational methods for accurate quantum mechanical calculations of rearrangement scattering, and semiclassical methods for including coherence and decoherence in photochemical dyanamics. I have also studied electronic structure methods-both wave function theory and density functional theory-for calculating the potential energy surfaces and couplings needed for Born-Oppenheimer and electronically nonadiabatic processes. A special interest is the use of direct dynamics and efficient interfaces between electronic structure and dynamics. These methods have been applied to processes in the gas phase, in clusters, on metal surfaces, in solution, and in enzymes. Applications have been made to specific systems of both fundamental and practical importance, including problems in thermochemistry, combustion, photochemistry, atmospheric chemistry and the aqueous environment, catalysis, biochemistry, medicinal chemistry, neuroscience, and nanoparticles.My research is in theoretical and computational physical chemistry with special emphases on reaction dynamics and quantum mechanics.

VThe current research in my laboratory is directed towards a better understanding of cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disease that affects 1 in 2,500 live births in the Caucasian population.  The hallmarks of CF include elevated sweat electrolytes, chronic obstructive lung disease, pancreatic insufficiency and infertility in males.  Since the identification of the responsible mutations in a gene we named CFTR, my laboratory continues to focus on the detection of additional mutations in the gene, correlation of genotype with phenotype, and additional genetic loci (defined as modifier genes) which can modulate the severity of CF disease.  These studies will bring additional insights into the pathogenesis of CF and alternative means of therapy for the disease.  I have also organized a worldwide consortium for CF mutation analysis.  The work has so far resulted in the description of over 1,200 different CFTR mutations, providing useful information for the structure and function analysis of the CFTR protein.  In addition, I am interested in genetic and disease gene analysis in general, particularly through the physical mapping of human chromosome 7.  The goal of the latter project has been to generate an integrated genetic, physical and transcriptional map for this chromosome to facilitate identification of other disease genes.The current research in my laboratory is directed towards a better understanding of cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disease that affects 1 in 2,500 live births in the Caucasian population.

VI am an ecologist whose research emphasizes the influence of spatial heterogeneity on ecological processes. I use field study and simulation models to elucidate the causes and consequences of spatial pattern, and my work contributed to the new sub-discipline of landscape ecology.  My research group has identified nonlinearities in spatial systems and suggested new conceptual frameworks for understanding landscape dynamics.  I have studied the patterns and effects of natural disturbances, focusing especially on fire in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.  Our research generated new insights about how natural crown fires influence vegetation patterns, animal movements, and ecosystem processes (especially carbon and nitrogen dynamics). I have also studied how socioeconomic and environmental drivers influence land-use dynamics and how land-use, in turn, affects plants, animals and soils.  Land-use partly determines habitat availability for many species, but historical land-use still influences contemporary ecosystems. Our research on animal movement and habitat use in heterogeneous landscapes has also identified important spatial determinants of population dynamics. Recently, I have been working to extend understanding of spatial heterogeneity to ecosystem processes.  My diverse research projects share the common goal of understanding the reciprocal interactions between spatial patterns and ecological processes across a wide range of scales.I am an ecologist whose research emphasizes the influence of spatial heterogeneity on ecological processes.

VThe focus of my research has been to gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes, especially in the visual modality. I have been examining the functional areas that comprise visual association cortex in macaque monkeys and the role these areas play in perception, attention, learning, and memory through the use of anatomical tracing and histochemical staining techniques; electrophysiological recordings of neural activity in awake, behaving monkeys; and behavioral assessment of selective brain lesions. In an attempt to identify homologies between human and monkey brains, I have been studying human brain tissue applying the same histochemical staining techniques I used on monkey brain tissue. I have also been conducting functional brain-imaging studies in humans that parallel those in employed in monkeys to investigate the neural systems in human cortex that are engaged during perception, attention, learning, and memory.The focus of my research has been to gain insight into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive processes, especially in the visual modality.

VI have been fascinated by the molecular machinery that generates the intracellular movements of organelles, chromosomes, mRNAs, and protein complexes. As a graduate student I was involved in discovering a new motor protein called kinesin that moves along microtubules. Kinesins are now known to constitute a large protein superfamily whose members carry out diverse motile activities important for cell division, development, and membrane functions. One interest of my laboratory has been to understand the mechanism by which kinesins convert the energy from ATP hydrolysis into unidirectional motion. To tackle this question, we initially developed microscopy-based assays for studying kinesin-generated motility in vitro and extended these methods to study movement produced by individual kinesin molecules. Using such assays with structural and spectroscopic approaches and protein engineering, we have developed a detailed model for explaining how ATP-induced structural changes in the motor leads to directional motion. The biological functions of motors and microtubules also have been topics of continued interest to my laboratory. We have studied how mRNAs and membranes interact with particular motor proteins and how regulatory proteins modulate the dynamic behavior of the microtubule cytoskeleton.I have been fascinated by the molecular machinery that generates the intracellular movements of organelles, chromosomes, mRNAs, and protein complexes.

As a theoretical computer scientist I am interested in devising models and proving theorems that shed light on phenomena and questions such as the following: Why are some functions easy to compute while other closely related ones are apparently not? How can the phenomenon of inductive learning, as exhibited remarkably by many species including humans, be captured mathematically so that its potential can be realized by machine and its ultimate limitations understood? How can parallel and distributed computer and data systems be conceptualized and organized so that they can be controlled as effectively as conventional sequential computers?

VFor the past 25 years my research has focused on the isolation and characterization of large icosahedral, dsDNA-containing viruses that infect certain unicellular, eukaryotic chlorella-like green algae. These viruses (family Phycodnaviridae ) exist in fresh water from all over the world with natural titers as high as 105 infectious particles per ml. The chlorella viruses have genomes as large as 380 kb and contain as many as 400 protein encoding- and 16 tRNA encoding-genes. In addition to their large genomes, chlorella viruses have other unexpected features: (i) They encode multiple DNA methyltransferases and DNA restriction endonucleases. (ii) Unlike other glycoprotein-containing viruses, chlorella viruses encode most, if not all, of the components required to glycosylate their proteins. (iii) Chlorella viruses are the first viruses with more than one type of intron. (iv) Many chlorella virus-encoded proteins are either the smallest or among the smallest proteins of their class and some may represent the minimal functional unit. Consequently, these proteins serve as models for mechanistic and structural studies. Examples include the medically relevant proteins DNA type II topoisomerase and potassium ion channel protein. (v) Finally, accumulating evidence indicates that the chlorella viruses and their genes have a long evolutionary history, maybe over a billion years. Therefore, studies on these viruses may reveal interesting aspects about the evolution of genes and genomes.For the past 25 years my research has focused on the isolation and characterization of large icosahedral, dsDNA-containing viruses that infect certain unicellular, eukaryotic chlorella-like green algae.

VThe theme of my research program is the use of microfabrication techniques and advanced experimental probes to study the fundamental properties of superconducting materials and superconductor electronic devices. The primary focus has been the exploration of quantum phenomena and phase dynamics in superconducting systems using SQUIDs (Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices), the world's most sensitive detectors of currents and magnetic fields. At the beginning of my career, the emphasis was on measurements of charge transport in nonequilibrium superconductors and magnetic vortex transport in superconductor arrays. For this work, we developed novel scanning probe instruments, in particular the Scanning SQUID Microscope that allows the imaging of vortex configurations and dynamics in superconductor systems. After the discovery of the high temperature superconductors, my group pioneered the phase-sensitive SQUID interferometry technique for determining the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter and verified the exotic d-wave symmetry, a discovery that launched a still-ongoing effort to understand the symmetry and mechanism of unconventional superconductors. Present interests include transport and fluctuations in high temperature superconductor nanowires, and quantum dynamics and sources of decoherence in superconductor devices and their application in quantum computing.The theme of my research program is the use of microfabrication techniques and advanced experimental probes to study the fundamental properties of superconducting materials and superconductor electronic devices.

VI am a demographer with broad interdisciplinary interests in biodemography, mathematical demography, and studies of the consequences of demographic change and their policy implications. I helped build the modern field of biodemography and contributed to the discovery of the plasticity of longevity in humans and various other species. Recently I have developed evolutionary demographic models of the age-trajectories of fertility, mortality, and growth and have shown that under some conditions fertility continues to increase with age and mortality continues to fall.

In mathematical demography, I have developed "frailty models" for analyzing the dynamics of heterogeneous populations as well as methods for decomposing population changes and differences into direct and compositional effects.

I helped build the modern field of biodemography and contributed to the discovery of the plasticity of longevity in humans and various other species. Recently I have developed evolutionary demographic models of the age-trajectories of fertility, mortality, and growth and have shown that under some conditions fertility continues to increase with age and mortality continues to fall.

VMy research interests focus on molecules in interstellar space and their role in the formation of new stars and planets. Trained as a chemist, I have used ab initio quantum chemical techniques to study the photodissociation dynamics of small molecules. The calculated cross sections and rates have been used to construct comprehensive models of the physical and chemical structure of interstellar clouds under the influence of ultraviolet radiation. More recently my research has shifted to star-forming regions. My group carries out molecular line observations at submillimeter and infrared wavelengths, using a variety of ground- and space-based telescopes. Both gas-phase and solid-state species (in particular ices) are studied. A new set of radiative transfer codes has been developed to analyze the molecular excitation under different astrophysical situations and infer accurate abundances from the observational data. Simulations of the processes that occur in icy grain mantles are carried out in the Leiden laboratory for astrophysics. The observations, models, and experiments provide new insights into the evolution of the molecular abundances from interstellar clouds to new solar systems and they emphasize the importance of molecules as diagnostics of the star- and planet-formation process.My research interests focus on molecules in interstellar space and their role in the formation of new stars and planets.

VMy research centers on genomics and its broad implications to understanding cellular function, evolution, medicine and the environment. I founded three not-for-profit research institutes that cover key areas of my research. The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) sequenced the first genome from a free-living organism in 1995. TIGR has since completed genomic sequencing and analysis of over 50 eukaryote and microbial organisms. The Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives (IBEA) is exploring ways to use biology and genomics for carbon dioxide sequestration and to produce clean fuels such as hydrogen. IBEA is undertaking genome engineering to synthetically create a microbial chromosome based on first principals of gene requirements to support a living self-replicating cell. IBEA in collaboration with TIGR is using the whole genome shotgun method to sequence all the organisms in an environment, beginning with the Sargasso Sea. The Center for the Advancement of Genomics (TCAG) is devoted to the public implications of our sequencing of the human genome. Projects include: ethno-genomics and an exploration of "race" and its genetic components. TCAG is actively engaged in sequencing genomes of a defined clinical population and correlating genomic information with medical history to assess risk for certain diseases.My research centers on genomics and its broad implications to understanding cellular function, evolution, medicine and the environment.

VStudying operator algebra problems, I was led to introduce free probability theory. This is a highly noncommutative probability theory where the random variables , like the quantum observables, are operators on Hilbert space, but where independence is defined in a new way so that the freely independent random variables are, in general, quite far from commuting . The theory runs parallel to a surprisingly large part of basic probability theory. For instance, there is a free central limit theorem, where the Gauss law is replaced by the semicircle law. The semicircle law had appeared earlier in Wigner's work on random matrices and it provided the first clue to a connection with random matrix theory. I later showed that the large N limit of random matrices provides an aymptotic model of free probability theory. This led to applications of free probability to random matrices and in a converse direction to many applications of random matrices to the von Neumann algebra problems which had been my starting point. Also, several applications to operator algebras appeared when I found that I could develop information theoretic concepts in free probability, similar to those around Shannon's differential entropy. From time to time, I return from the probabilistic exploration of the highest degree of noncommutativity to pure operator theory methods.Studying operator algebra problems, I was led to introduce free probability theory.

VMy research centers on general relativity--the theory of space, time, and gravitation formulated by Einstein in 1915--with the goal of gaining deeper insights into spacetime structure and gravitation. Black holes and their thermodynamic properties presently offer us the greatest opportunities to gain such insights. A black hole is a region where gravity is so strong that nothing--not even light--can escape; remarkably, though, because of quantum mechanical processes, particles are spontaneously produced outside a black hole in such a manner that it would appear to a distant observer that the black hole is emitting radiation of exactly the same nature as emitted by an ordinary body in thermal equilibrium. As a consequence, black holes have a non-zero physical temperature and can be assigned a well-defined entropy, which presumably corresponds to their quantum degrees of freedom.  My research has included a study of the particle creation process and other phenomena involving quantum fields in the presence of gravity, a derivation of general formula for black hole entropy, and an analysis of the "generalized second law" of thermodynamics, which considers the contributions of black holes to the total entropy of the Universe.My research centers on general relativity--the theory of space, time, and gravitation formulated by Einstein in 1915--with the goal of gaining deeper insights into spacetime structure and gravitation.

His work has led to the demonstration that these enzymes have a rotary mechanism. Currently, he and his colleagues are studying how rotation is generated from the transmembrane proton motive force. He and his colleagues have also worked on other vital proteins in mammalian mitochondria.

VCurrent research in the lab centers on two fundamental questions in cell biology: how proteins become properly localized within a cell and how eukaryotic cells regulate the abundance of their organelles. The Molecular Mechanism of Protein Targeting. Our work over the last 24 years on the structure and function of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and its receptor established basic paradigms for our current understanding of signal sequence recognition and co-translational protein targeting to the ER and the bacterial plasma membrane. This research covers a wide terrain, ranging from the discovery of components and their functional analyses to their biophysical and crystallographic characterization, and has led to an increasingly precise understanding of both the molecular mechanism and the physiological context of the pathway. Regulation of Organelle Abundance. Research during the last 12 years has deciphered the mechanism by which proliferation of the ER is controlled according to need. Using genetic approaches in S. cerevisiae, the lab has unraveled the mechanism of an intracellular signal transduction pathway that mediates communication between the ER lumen (where a sensor determines need for more ER) and the nucleus (where transcription of genes encoding ER proteins is induced). This pathway, termed the "Unfolded Protein Response" or UPR, coordinately regulates expression of ER resident proteins and key enzymes in lipid biosynthesis. Characterization of the UPR has revealed many surprising steps, including a novel mRNA splicing pathway and control of translation elongation by an mRNA intron.Current research in the lab centers on two fundamental questions in cell biology: how proteins become properly localized within a cell and how eukaryotic cells regulate the abundance of their organelles.

VFor most of us, there is an apparent simplicity to seeing. This simplicity belies the sophisticated neural computations needed to interpret the visual world. We can learn about the neural computations of vision by building instruments to perform visual tasks, or by studying the dramatic loss of perceptual abilities following cortical damage. We can also learn about visual computations by modeling the relationship between perception and human cortical signals and circuitry. For example, my laboratory has analyzed the visual computations needed to assign a constant color to an object, despite enormous variations in both intensity and color of the ambient illumination. Also, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified many of the distinct cortical areas within the human brain. From such measurements, we are learning about the specialized cortical computations for color, motion, and form. Using diffusion tensor imaging, a magnetic resonance imaging method that provides information about the neural connections between different regions of the brain, we are learning about the development of connections between brain areas. The development of neural pathways that perform challenging visual recognition tasks, such as reading, is of special interest. We hope to understand more about how the brain develops an expertise for reading, and to learn how these neural signals are communicated to regions of the brain that compute language and thought.For most of us, there is an apparent simplicity to seeing.

VThe goal of our research is to understand how and why our cells die through apoptosis and eventually use this knowledge to combat human diseases in which apoptosis becomes defective. These diseases include cancer and neurodegerative diseases during which apoptosis is either blocked or undesirably turned on. We have been using biochemical approaches to study apoptosis. Specifically, we set-up biochemical assays that reproduce biochemical reactions that contribute to apoptotic cell death. Using this approach, we have uncovered biochemical pathways that activate intracellular apoptotic proteases (caspases) and fragment chromatin DNA during apoptosis. During the biochemical analysis of apoptotic pathways in human cells, we discovered the role of mitochondria in apoptosis. We found that mitochondria release proteins such as cytochrome c, Smac, and EndoG from their intermembrane space during apoptosis. These proteins then interact with cytosolic proteins to trigger the activation of caspases and DNA fragmentation. We also found that the release of these apoptogenetic proteins is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, a group of homologous proteins that have roles in tumorgenesis. Our current research is focusing on how apoptotic signals transduce to mitochondria. We are also collaborating with chemists to design small chemicals to regulate the mitochondria-initiated apoptotic pathways.The goal of our research is to understand how and why our cells die through apoptosis and eventually use this knowledge to combat human diseases in which apoptosis becomes defective.

We are also collaborating with chemists to design small chemicals to regulate the mitochondria-initiated apoptotic pathways.The goal of our research is to understand how and why our cells die through apoptosis and eventually use this knowledge to combat human diseases in which apoptosis becomes defective. These diseases include cancer and neurodegerative diseases during which apoptosis is either blocked or undesirably turned on. We have been using biochemical approaches to study apoptosis. Specifically, we set-up biochemical assays that reproduce biochemical reactions that contribute to apoptotic cell death. Using this approach, we have uncovered biochemical pathways that activate intracellular apoptotic proteases (caspases) and fragment chromatin DNA during apoptosis. During the biochemical analysis of apoptotic pathways in human cells, we discovered the role of mitochondria in apoptosis. We found that mitochondria release proteins such as cytochrome c, Smac, and EndoG from their intermembrane space during apoptosis. These proteins then interact with cytosolic proteins to trigger the activation of caspases and DNA fragmentation.

VMy research involves the introduction and utilization of computer models for simulating the function of biological systems, as well as advancing the current understanding of how such systems work. I also use this enhanced understanding to develop relational-based methods for biomedical applications. In the early stages of the field, I pioneered molecular dynamics simulations in biology, by simulating the primary event in the vision process. At approximately the same time, I introduced models for simulating and quantifying enzyme catalysis, by the development of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods, including the empirical valence bond (EVB) approach, paving the way for the majority of contemporary computational studies of enzymatic reactions. These and other contributions laid the foundation for what can now be termed "computational enzymology" - i.e. the linkage of experiment and theory in enzymology. I also initiated the use of microscopic models for studies of electrostatic effects in biology. All these approaches have been subsequently used by my research group to examine a very wide variety of biological problems, ranging from the study of photobiological processes to enzyme action (for many systems), enzyme design, signal transduction, DNA replication and fidelity, molecular motors, ion channels, proton pumps, electron transport and drug resistance.My research involves the introduction and utilization of computer models for simulating the function of biological systems, as well as advancing the current understanding of how such systems work.

VTrained in statistics and mathematics, I became interested in the early 1970s in a set of problems from molecular biology. Today these problems are classified as sequence analysis including inference of evolutionary trees, predication of RNA secondary structure, multiple alignment, gaped alignment, and local alignment. The local alignment, or the Smith-Waterman algorithm, became the foundation tool for database search methods. The statistical distribution of local alignment scores is a very important aspect of assessing biological significance. As the genome project began, my interests turned to physical mapping with the Lander-Waterman formulas and estimating the quality of DNA sequences. Currently I am working on a new approach to genome sequence assembly, using an old idea of Euler's and on the assignment of sequence accuracy. Other projects include haplotype estimation and gene family evolution.Trained in statistics and mathematics, I became interested in the early 1970s in a set of problems from molecular biology.

VMy laboratory has worked on large-scale genome analysis. In collaboration with the Sanger Centre, we constructed a physical map and obtained the complete sequence of the first animal genome, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We contributed to the completion of the S. cerevesiae, A. thaliana, and other genomes and are principal partners in the Human Genome Project which constructed the clone map and contributed 20 percent of the sequence. We also pioneered the use of the Internet for the rapid release of sequence and map information. In other gene-identification projects, we generated more than two million expressed sequence tags from a variety of organisms, providing access to many thousands of genes and aiding in genome sequence interpretation. With collaborators we identified 1.4M single nucleotide variants in the human genome for use in genetic mapping and disease discovery. Early genetic analysis of muscle formation in C. elegans led to the identification of many of the required genes and a model of myofilament lattice assembly. The need to identify the large number of genes required for muscle formation led to development of new tools for gene recovery in C. elegans, including tRNA nonsense suppressors, transposons and ultimately the map and sequence of C. elegans.My laboratory has worked on large-scale genome analysis.

VRecent research in my group has focused on two main areas. The first studies static and dynamic properties of interfaces, concentrating in particular on theories of crystal growth and the dynamics of steps on crystal surfaces under nonequilibrium driving forces. We have developed general theories describing step bunching instabilities and patterns that form when an array of steps is heated by a direct electric current or when their motion is perturbed locally by impurities with various properties.  The second area deals with properties of inhomogeneous and confined fluids. We are trying to develop a new and general treatment of the long-ranged Coulomb interactions in nonuniform ionic and dipolar fluids (water in particular) by mapping properties of these systems to those of a simpler mimic system, with short-ranged intermolecular interactions but in an effective single-particle field that takes account of the averaged effects of the long-ranged interactions. These ideas may provide a better understanding of hydrophobic interactions and solvation in water and may lead to more efficient computer simulations of charged systems.Recent research in my group has focused on two main areas.

VAs a geneticist, I have studied the genes that control developmental decisions in animals and plants, the basis of phenotypic variation in natural populations, and the mechanisms of genetic incompatibility. In my early work, I investigated pattern formation in the embryo of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and in the flower of the mustard relative Arabidopsis thaliana. The study of flowers led to an interest in how the onset of flowering is controlled. My laboratory discovered several of the key factors that integrate upstream signals in this process, among them the gene that encodes the long-sought-after mobile molecule controlling flowering. Plants are highly variable in their flowering behavior, and through the study of flowering I became interested in the question of how organisms adapt to their environment. Today, we approach this topic both in a top-down manner, where we characterize species- and genome-wide patterns of sequence diversity, and with bottom-up approaches, where we deploy the power of genetics to track down the genes responsible for variation in responses to the environment. Finally, some of our most recent studies focus on the processes that cause genomes to become incompatible with each other on the road to speciation.As a geneticist, I have studied the genes that control developmental decisions in animals and plants, the basis of phenotypic variation in natural populations, and the mechanisms of genetic incompatibility.

VAs a biofluid mechanician I have developed a broad range of models to explore the relationship between structure and function in physiological transport. My laboratory has developed a theory for microvascular blood-tissue heat exchange now known as the Weinbaum-Jihi bioheat equation. I have developed two basic models for the transport of cholesterol in the arterial wall. The first describes at the cellular level how a small population of endothelial cells in the process of turnover transports cholesterol molecules into the arterial intima. The second described an earlier hypothesis of vesicular transport of cholesterol across vascular endothelium. My laboratory has developed a series of subcellular models examining the role of the endothelial glycocalyx in microvascular exchange and the interaction of red and white cells with the endothelial surface. I have also proposed a fluid-shear hypothesis and model to explain how osteocytes are able to sense mechanical loading. More recently I have been trying to decipher cellular mechanosensory and strain amplification mechanisms in cytoskeletal signaling. New hypotheses have been proposed for brush border microvilli in the kidney and for strain amplification in the cytoskeleton of bone cell processes.As a biofluid mechanician I have developed a broad range of models to explore the relationship between structure and function in physiological transport.

VI'm interested in understanding the signaling mechanisms involved in regulating T lymphocyte development and responses.  We've focused mainly on signal transduction by the T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen.  The TCR is an oligomeric structure, consisting of the products of 6 genes.  To understand the TCR structural complexity, we used chimeric receptors and found that the receptor's invariant chains use common sequence motifs to couple the antigen recognition subunit of the TCR to cytoplasmic Src and Syk/ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase families.  These two families of kinases interact with the receptor in a sequential and highly coordinated manner, a paradigm used by other immune cell antigen receptors. We're interested in how the process of receptor signaling via cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases is initiated, regulated, and terminated.  We've used somatic cell genetics to define critical signaling components downstream of the TCR, including two adaptors that appear to be involved in assembling a scaffold for a signaling complex.  We'd like to understand the assembly of the signaling complex and how this complex is regulated.  Since tyrosine phosphorylation plays a key role in TCR signals, we've become interested in the function of transmembrane tyrosine phosphatases such as CD45.  CD45 regulates the Src family kinases within the TCR signaling pathway.  Surprisingly, dimerization of CD45 inhibits its catalytic function via a wedge-like structure in the CD45 juxtamembrane domain. We'd like to understand how dimerization is regulated and its importance in the immune system.I'm interested in understanding the signaling mechanisms involved in regulating T lymphocyte development and responses.

VMost of my research has been dedicated to establishing an observational and experimental basis for relativistic gravitation. In this I have been influenced by the work of Robert Dicke in the early 1960s. Because the relativistic effects are usually small, the research tends toward the development of techniques to measure small quantities with precision and to understand the limitations in the measurements. As a young physicist I worked with the methods developed by I. I. Rabi and J. R. Zacharias to measure the properties of isolated molecules and atoms. This led to the development of atomic clocks and the frequency stabilization of lasers. Later research was carried out to measure the spectrum and angular distribution of the cosmic background radiation, first from balloon platforms and subsequently using the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite. In the early 1970s I began to work on the laser interferometric detection of gravitational waves which has grown into the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) project and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission (LISA). The aim of both projects is to detect gravitational waves from astrophysical sources, LIGO between 10 Hz to several kHz and LISA between 1/10000 to 1/10 of a Hz. Detectable gravitational waves will come from accelerating mass in highly relativistic regions with strong gravitational fields. The waves will offer a "look" at the strong field gravitation in the vicinity of black holes and possibly the earliest moments of the Universe.Most of my research has been dedicated to establishing an observational and experimental basis for relativistic gravitation.

VMy research interests are in two areas of malaria biology: (1) the interactions between Plasmodium parasites and human host tissues that affect the severity of disease, and (2) the molecular events of drug responses and drug resistance that determine antimalarial treatment outcomes. In the second of these areas, my colleagues and I study the mechanism of a transporter responsible for chloroquine resistance (PfCRT) and structure-activity relationships relevant to the discovery of new antimalarial drugs. In the first area, we work on the genetics of P. falciparum virulence and investigate human hemoglobin mutations that can alter the cytoadherence properties of parasitized red blood cells. Research on P. falciparum virulence to different primates is producing new information on invasion molecules involved in the specificity of malaria parasites for red blood cells. In studies of malaria protection by hemoglobin mutations, our findings indicate that altered forms of hemoglobin can interfere with functions of the major variable adherence molecule (PfEMP-1) inserted by P. falciparum in the membrane of its host red blood cell. We are exploring whether this interference can ameliorate disease severity by reducing inflammatory events from the sequestration of parasitized red cells in host blood vessels.My research interests are in two areas of malaria biology: (1) the interactions between Plasmodium parasites and human host tissues that affect the severity of disease, and (2) the molecular events of drug responses and drug resistance that determine antimalarial treatment outcomes. In the second of these areas, my colleagues and I study the mechanism of a transporter responsible for chloroquine resistance (PfCRT) and structure-activity relationships relevant to the discovery of new antimalarial drugs.

VMy laboratory focuses on several aspects of cystic fibrosis (CF), a common lethal genetic disease. We are investigating the CF gene product, CFTR, to learn how it forms a chloride channel, how its activity is regulated, and how CF-associated mutations disrupt function. Most of the morbidity and mortality in CF results from chronic lung infections. To understand the pathogenesis of the lung disease we are investigating the innate immune system that defends the lung from bacterial challenge. The studies examine how CF compromises this defense system and how bacteria persist in the CF lung. We attempt to use knowledge from these studies to develop new CF treatments, including transfer of a normal CFTR cDNA to airway epithelia and interventions to enhance airway defense.My laboratory focuses on several aspects of cystic fibrosis (CF), a common lethal genetic disease.

VResearch in my laboratory involves studies in chemistry, biology, and medicine. We are interested in the design and mechanism of action of molecules that exhibit unique biological activity and therapeutic potential and in developing fundamentally new ways of synthesizing such compounds.  My group has introduced a number of new reactions and strategies for synthesis including arenealkene photocycloadditions and metal catalyzed [4+4], [4+2], [5+2], [6+2], [2+2+1], [4+2+1], [5+2+1], and [5+1+2+1] cycloadditions. Over 50 total syntheses of a wide range of complex targets have been achieved including taxol--a remarkable anti-cancer drug, phorbol --an agent that is central to understanding the molecular basis for tumor promotion and arcinogenesis, resiniferatoxin--a new lead for treating neuropathic pain, and bryostatin analogs--designed agents that have an exceptional range of anti-cancer activities. Another interest in my laboratory is directed at understanding biological barriers and in developing new molecular strategies that would enable or enhance the passage of molecules across these barriers. This work has resulted in new strategies for drug delivery and for molecular imaging based on molecular transporters, agents that can be attached to a poorly or non-penetrating biologically active molecule to enhance its uptake into cells and tissue.Research in my laboratory involves studies in chemistry, biology, and medicine.

VMy scientific interests lie in the origin and evolution of structure in the Universe, in particular, in understanding how galaxies form. I have been heavily involved in the development of numerical simulations as a practical tool to investigate these issues. Such simulations allow physical models for the many processes involved to be explored in a sufficiently realistic manner that detailed comparison with observation is possible. A major question in this field is the nature of the unseen dark matter which appears to be the dominant component of all objects larger than individual galaxies. I have spent much of my career developing and testing the hypothesis that this material is made of a new type of elementary particle, so-called Cold Dark Matter.My scientific interests lie in the origin and evolution of structure in the Universe, in particular, in understanding how galaxies form.

VI study human origins and evolution in the contexts of past biological and cultural environments. To more completely understand the human past I work with a large international team, gathering data from geology, biology, paleontology, and archaeology. I have worked in these disciplines in both laboratory and field capacities in the African rift system, most recently in Ethiopia. Our research there in the Middle Awash research area has illuminated a uniquely long and complete record of human occupation spanning more than 5 million years. A new genus (Ardipithecus) and two new early hominid species (A. ramidus; A. garhi) have been revealed, along with a wealth of contextual information. We are currently focusing on five key time horizons (c. 0.25, 1.0, 2.5, 4.4, and 5.2 million years). For each horizon, the research team is synthesizing information gained from anatomical, paleoenvironmental, geochronological, and archaeological analyses. These complex data sets are being integrated with knowledge from other Old World sites to solve paleoanthropological problems surrounding the origins of the Hominidae, our earliest technological behaviors, the origins of Homo, and the geographic origin and material culture of the earliest anatomically modern humans.I study human origins and evolution in the contexts of past biological and cultural environments.

VI am interested in viruses and prions (infectious proteins) and their interactions with their eukaryotic host cells. My colleagues and I have described several prions and RNA viruses of the yeast Saccharomyces, and are studying these as models for similar entities in mammals. We have examined the mechanisms of RNA virus replication, transcription, and packaging and mechanisms of translation of viral mRNA. We have found cellular genes needed to propagate these elements and host systems that limit the ability of RNA viruses to propagate and thus limit their pathogenicity. We are now investigating the mechanisms of prion generation and propagation using the [URE3], [PSI] and [PIN] prions of the Ure2, Sup35 and Rnq1 proteins of yeast. We have shown that the amyloids underlying these three prions have an in-register parallel beta sheet architecture and proposed how this may explain the ability of yeast prions proteins to template their structure and thus to act as genes. We have shown that the [PSI] and [URE3] prions can be lethal or toxic to cells, and, perhaps for this reason, we find that wild yeast strains have polymorphisms of Sup35p and Rnq1p that limit the spread of prions within the species. We find that the Btn2 and Cur1 proteins are capable of curing the [URE3] prion, and are interested in understanding the mechanism of this effect.I am interested in viruses and prions (infectious proteins) and their interactions with their eukaryotic host cells.

VUnderstanding the biochemical mechanisms of multi-component ATP-dependent cellular machines required for DNA replication, protein remodeling, and protein degradation has been my long-term scientific goal. Our current research is focused on the mechanism of action of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones and the role of chaperones in proteolysis. Molecular chaperones are present in all organisms and are highly conserved. They mediate protein remodeling, folding, unfolding, assembly, and disassembly without themselves being part of the final complex. Chaperones participate in many fundamental cellular processes including DNA replication, regulation of gene expression, cell division, membrane translocation, protein folding, and protein degradation. Many are induced by environmental stresses and play a critical role during cell stress by preventing the appearance of folding intermediates that lead to irreversibly damaged proteins. They assist in the recovery from stress by refolding and reactivating damaged proteins and by disaggregating aggregated proteins. Some chaperones interact with specific proteolytic components forming compartmentalized ATP-dependent proteases. When associated with proteases, chaperones function in the delivery of damaged proteins and regulatory proteins to the proteolytic component. Molecular chaperones are of fundamental biological importance and are medically relevant, since a number of diseases are caused by aberrant protein folding reactions.Understanding the biochemical mechanisms of multi-component ATP-dependent cellular machines required for DNA replication, protein remodeling, and protein degradation has been my long-term scientific goal.

VClifford M. Will is a member of the Gravitation Group, the Institute for Fundamental Theory and the Institute of High-Energy Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Florida. He studies the observable aspects of Einstein?s general theory of relativity. A current program of research involves calculating the gravitational radiation from inspiraling and merging binary systems of compact objects (neutron stars or black holes). These are the most promising sources of gravitational waves detectable by laser-interferometric gravitational-wave observatories, such as LIGO in the USA and a proposed space interferometer, eLISA. Important astronomical information can be extracted from the detected signals by comparing them against theoretical "template" waveforms that have been calculated to high precision using general relativity. For the inspiral phase, he calculates the waveforms using high-order versions of the "post-Newtonian" approximation to general relativity. A related topic is testing alternative theories of gravity using gravitational-wave observations. He also studies ways to test Einstein?s theory in the strong-field regime near black holes. He has proposed to test whether the supermassive object that resides at the center of our galaxy is really a rotating black hole of general relativity by detecting and observing stars orbiting very close to the object, measuring changes in their orbits very precisely as they respond to the curved spacetime around the massive body. Such measurements could reveal whether that spacetime is the unique geometry of a rotating black hole called the Kerr metric.Clifford M.

VMy research has been directed to understanding mammalian gametes and embryos and to the use of that knowledge in research, agriculture and medicine. Methods for the deep freeze preservation of mammalian embryos that were developed now offer important opportunities for long term storage and for transport between different laboratories. The importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the molecular regulation of early development was emphasised by experiments in sheep. Use of inappropriate culture media for just 3 days can lead to the birth of unusually large lambs as a result of changes in expression of imprinted genes. Similar perturbations arise if the uterine environment is disturbed through nutritional or endocrine mechanisms. More recently my research has been focused on the factors regulating embryo development after nuclear transfer.  This work led to the first birth of live lambs from foetal and adult cells, including Dolly.  Subsequently, genetic changes were introduced into sheep by nuclear transfer from modified cultured cells. Present procedures for nuclear transfer are very inefficient because they fail to change gene expression in the transferred nucleus from the pattern associated with the specific donor tissue to that required to control development to term. Current research is designed to overcome these limitations.My research has been directed to understanding mammalian gametes and embryos and to the use of that knowledge in research, agriculture and medicine.

VAn abiding interest of mime is comparative osteology and I have applied this to studies of the fragmentary animal remains excavated from archaeological sites.  The objectives of this research are to better understand prehistoric human uses of animal resources.  Animal remains represent species obtained for food, those managed or domestic, and introduced species.  Inferences can be made about environmental conditions based on the animal used keeping in mind that the species recovered from archaeological sites represent a selection of available species.  To maximize the information that can be gained from such faunal samples, whenever possible, the component of the archaeological deposits re recovered using a fine gauge recovery strategy and samples are of adequate sizes to be representative of the deposit.  For holistic studies, all fragments are identified to the lowest possible taxon.  We try to identify all vertebrate remain and mollusks, echinoderms, and crustaceans among invertebrates.  Measurement of critical feature of the fragments that correlate with body size of the organisms can provide indications of overexploitation and conditions of herd animals.  Ages at death of the represented organisms are taken when possible to assess the hunting pressures or slaughter strategies of domestic animals in the past.  Integration of comparable studies of macrobotanical remains adds further information about past human ecology and environmental conditions.An abiding interest of mime is comparative osteology and I have applied this to studies of the fragmentary animal remains excavated from archaeological sites.  The objectives of this research are to better understand prehistoric human uses of animal resources.  Animal remains represent species obtained for food, those managed or domestic, and introduced species.  Inferences can be made about environmental conditions based on the animal used keeping in mind that the species recovered from archaeological sites represent a selection of available species.  To maximize the information that can be gained from such faunal samples, whenever possible, the component of the archaeological deposits re recovered using a fine gauge recovery strategy and samples are of adequate sizes to be representative of the deposit.  For holistic studies, all fragments are identified to the lowest possible taxon.  We try to identify all vertebrate remain and mollusks, echinoderms, and crustaceans among invertebrates.

VAs a planetary scientist, I study the dynamics of the solar system. Solar system dynamics encompasses the study of the orbital and rotational motion of the planets, the evolution of asteroids, meteoroids, and comets, and the evolution of Earth's Moon and the other satellite systems. I have focused on the application of techniques from modern nonlinear dynamics to solar system problems. With my students and colleagues, I have shown that the motion of the planetary system is chaotic, the obliquity of Mars undergoes large chaotic variations, the asteroid belt is shaped by chaotic dynamics, meteorites and comets are delivered to Earth by way of chaotic zones, Saturn's satellite Hyperion tumbles chaotically, and the satellites of Uranus have undergone episodes of chaotic behavior. Using techniques from nonlinear dynamics, I have also developed algorithms that have been widely adopted for studies in solar system dynamics. Though once just a curiosity, chaotic dynamics now permeates all dynamical studies of the solar system and extrasolar planets.As a planetary scientist, I study the dynamics of the solar system.

VAlthough I have done some research in cosmology and nuclear physics my research interests are primarily in theoretical elementary particle physics.  The study of elementary particles provides access to the laws of nature at their most fundamental level. Currently we have a theory for the strong, weak and electromagnetic interactions of elementary particles that has been extensively tested in experiments.  It is usually called the standard model.  Even with this theory many features of the data not explained. For example, the quark and lepton masses are free parameters in the standard model and are not predicted. Furthermore the theory has some unattractive aspects the most noteworthy of them being the extreme fine tuning need to keep the Higgs mass small compared to the ultraviolet cutoff for the theory. This is sometimes called the hierarchy problem. My own research breaks into two parts. One part is using the standard model to predict experimental observables. Just because you have a theory doesn't mean it's straightforward to use it to compare with experiment. Usually such comparisons involve expansions in some small quantity. One area I have done considerable research on is the development of methods to make predictions for the properties of hadrons that contain a single heavy quark.  The other part is research on physics that is beyond what is in the standard model. In particular I have worked on the development of extensions of the standard model that solve the hierarchy problem, for example, low energy supersymmetry.Although I have done some research in cosmology and nuclear physics my research interests are primarily in theoretical elementary particle physics.

VMuch of my work is based on M. Polanyi's thermodynamic demonstration that the action of any catalyst depends on its ability to bind the altered substrate in the transition state more tightly than in the ground state, relaxing again to release the product. That momentary jump matches or exceeds the rate acceleration that an enzyme produces. Whereas enzyme reactions transpire in milliseconds, we have shown that some biological reactions require millions of years in the absence of a catalyst. Accordingly, stable analogues of the altered substrate in the transition state should be powerful inhibitors. Since our first successful test of that principle, in 1969, we and others have shown that transition state and multisubstrate analogues act as strong inhibitors of enzymes of every class, furnishing a practical basis for drug design. We use mutations of enzymes and inhibitors, along with structural information obtained by UV, X-ray, NMR, and mass spectrometry, to characterize the attractive forces responsible for transition state affinity and thus for catalysis itself. We have found that these forces exhibit high levels of synergism, associated with a tendency of enzyme active sites to surround the substrate so that their solid angle of contact is maximized.Much of my work is based on M.

Main theoretical results include the characterization of the large sample behavior of the likelihood function in terms of the metric property of the parameter space, and the construction prior distributions that allow practical nonparametric inference in high dimension. To implement statistical modeling and inference computationally I have worked on various aspects of Monte Carlo simulations and some of these works had helped to introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo methods into Bayesian statistics. On the application front, I have been involved in the development of statistical tools to analyze data from genomics experiments such as gene expression microarrays.

VMost of the research work I have done since my doctoral graduation, including my PhD thesis, has been related, theoretically and experimentally, with the use of radars for the remote probing of the upper atmosphere, from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers of altitude. My interests include the statistics of the fluctuations in the index of refraction of the scattering medium responsible for producing radar echoes and its theoretical relationship with the statistical characteristics of the echoes they produce. This comprises incoherent scattering theory, the technique used by many powerful radars built to study the ionosphere, a theory very closely connected with plasma fluctuation theory, where I have made some contributions. The same radars have been proven to be very powerful tools to study plasma and atmospheric turbulence, and in turn use turbulence as a tracer of the dynamics of the fluid in which they are embedded. In fact, many of my scientific contributions are related with the developing of new techniques to exploit the use of these radars for the study of related atmospheric and ionospheric phenomena, such as clear atmospheric turbulence and ionospheric irregularities. My interest was not limited to the development of the techniques, but included an effort to understand the physical mechanisms of the new phenomena I observed.Most of the research work I have done since my doctoral graduation, including my PhD thesis, has been related, theoretically and experimentally, with the use of radars for the remote probing of the upper atmosphere, from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers of altitude.

VMy laboratory utilizes high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the structure, dynamics, and folding mechanisms of proteins and to map their functional interactions. To understand protein function, it is essential to move beyond a static structural model to an understanding of protein dynamics and interactions. NMR is uniquely suited for characterization of protein dynamics over a broad range of time scales. We have applied NMR relaxation methods to characterize the conformational fluctuations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, obtaining new insights into the role of protein motions in the catalytic cycle. We are also applying NMR to characterize the structure and dynamics of unfolded states of proteins and protein folding intermediates. Using myoglobin as a paradigm, we have obtained new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of protein folding. We have shown that folding occurs by a hierarchical process and that the earliest initiation events involve local hydrophobic collapse at sites that can be predicted from the amino acid sequence. A major research interest in my laboratory is focused on protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions involved in the regulation of gene expression. We are particularly interested in mechanisms by which zinc finger proteins recognize DNA and both single and double stranded RNA. Our work on protein-protein interactions involving transcriptional coactivators has led us to recognize the key role that intrinsic protein disorder plays in cellular signaling processes.My laboratory utilizes high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the structure, dynamics, and folding mechanisms of proteins and to map their functional interactions.

VI am interested in the organization and function of chromatin, in particular, how chromatin regulates eukaryotic gene expression. Nucleosomes, the fundamental structures of chromatin fibers, restrict gene accessibility by the wrapping of DNA over histone protein octamers. We are exploring how genes are dynamically unmasked or mobilized by ATP-driven, multi-protein chromatin 'remodeling' enzymes, and the physiological significance of this process. We use a primarily biochemical approach, and have recently been studying the mechanism by which chromatin remodeling enzymes mobilize both the canonical histones and histone variants, thereby modulating gene expression in eukaryotes. Recently, we have also begun to investigate the centromeric histone variant that mediates the formation of the chromosome kinetochore.I am interested in the organization and function of chromatin, in particular, how chromatin regulates eukaryotic gene expression.

VI have worked in diverse areas of Engineering and Applied Science, generally concentrating on the phenomenon of Light.  My philosophy has been that if one takes a very fundamental approach toward solving practical problems, one is just as likely to stumble across a basic scientific truth as someone who cares only about pure science.  This has the additional benefit that the pragmatic problem might become solved as well.  Thus with the hopeful goal of making a practical impact, I have covered a broad variety of diverse research topics; nonlinear optics, laser-plasma interaction, infrared laser chemistry, photovoltaic energy conversion, strained-quantum-well lasers, and chemical modification of semiconductor surfaces. Currently my main interests are in quantum computing and quantum communication, spin-based electronics, optoelectronics, high speed optical communications including optical code division multiplexing, photonic crystals, nano-photonics in general including advanced optical lithography, and sub-wavelength plasmonic optics.I have worked in diverse areas of Engineering and Applied Science, generally concentrating on the phenomenon of Light.

VIn 1988, Dr. Yanagisawa and his colleagues identified endothelin as a potent vasoconstrictor factor produced by endothelial cells. Subsequently, his laboratory identified and molecularly characterized the endothelin isopeptide family, endothelin receptors, and endothelin converting enzymes. His recent series of gene targeting experiments in mice has unexpectedly demonstrated that the endothelin pathways are important in the embryonic development of neural crest-derived tissues, and has led to the discovery that endothelin and endothelin receptor mutations cause Hirschsprung's disease and related neurocristopathies in humans. Last year, his group also discovered orexins as endogenous ligands for orphan G protein-coupled receptors that may regulate feeding behavior. Recent results from his laboratory also indicate that orexins are fundamentally involved in the regulation of sleep.In 1988, Dr. Yanagisawa and his colleagues identified endothelin as a potent vasoconstrictor factor produced by endothelial cells.

VMy group's scientific efforts have focused on the discovery and characterization of novel families of cytokines and growth factors as well as their receptors (e.g., neurotrophins/Trks, the CNTF-IL6 family and their gp130-related receptor complexes, ephrins/Ephs, agrin/MuSK, collagens/DDRs, RORs and angiopoietins/Ties), on defining the signal transduction pathways utilized by these growth factor systems, as well as on elucidating the critical biologic roles these key molecular mediators play during normal development as well as in disease (with our more recent efforts focusing on vascular diseases and cancer, inflammatory diseases, muscle atrophy, and obesity and diabetes). Towards these ends my group often develops relevant new technologies (such as the first use of epitope tags in cloning receptors and doing pulldown assays; Traps, which represent a new class of very high-affinity protein-based  blockers of growth factor/cytokine action; and VelociGene, which allows for high-throughput manipulation of the mouse genome to make knockouts, transgenics and for other purposes). We have recently initiated large-scale efforts to functionize many genes via VelociGene technology, as well as to exploit VelociGene technology to humanize large portions of the mouse immune system so as to make it a more effective model. All of our efforts are accompanied by an attempt to translate our discoveries into novel therapeutics, several of which are producing promising results in clinical trials, such as the VEGF Trap for cancer and vascular eye diseases, the IL1-Trap for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, the IL-4/13 Trap for asthma and allergy, and Axokine for obesity and diabetes.My group's scientific efforts have focused on the discovery and characterization of novel families of cytokines and growth factors as well as their receptors (e.g., neurotrophins/Trks, the CNTF-IL6 family and their gp130-related receptor complexes, ephrins/Ephs, agrin/MuSK, collagens/DDRs, RORs and angiopoietins/Ties), on defining the signal transduction pathways utilized by these growth factor systems, as well as on elucidating the critical biologic roles these key molecular mediators play during normal development as well as in disease (with our more recent efforts focusing on vascular diseases and cancer, inflammatory diseases, muscle atrophy, and obesity and diabetes).

VMy research focuses primarily on the development of recombinant vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits for viral diseases of animals and humans. I have developed a safe and highly efficacious vaccinia virus recombinant vaccine and an inexpensive rapid diagnostic kit for rinderpest, a devastating viral disease of cattle in Africa and Asia, which are expected to achieve the global eradication of this disease. My earlier work demonstrated IFN-gamma deficiency in Arabian foals with severe combined immunodeficiency, a recessive autosomal trait. This led to my use of cytokines as attenuating and adjuvant genes to enhance the safety and efficacy of subunit and live recombinant vaccines in normal and immunodeficient animals. In addition, my laboratory has been investigating the expression of immune-evading genes by vaccinia virus and regulatory genes by immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV), and the effects of these proteins on the host. Deletions of these genes along with the expression of cytokine genes has resulted in the development of viral vectors that can be used for the generation of safe and highly efficacious recombinant vaccines. Most gratifying, however, are my contributions to furthering the transfer of sustainable technologies in molecular biology to developing countries; these efforts can lead to self-sufficiency of disease control in Africa and Asia.My research focuses primarily on the development of recombinant vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits for viral diseases of animals and humans.

VI have had a long-standing interest in immunology, the study of the body's defense against infections and tumors. Our focus has been on a subpopulation of leukocytes called natural killer (NK) cells.  Although NK cells were initially thought to display "non-specific" killing against tumors, our studies indicated that NK cells display receptors with specificity for ligands expressed on their cellular targets.  These NK cell receptors are germline-encoded by a complex of clustered genes, unlike closely related T cells that derive their receptors by gene rearrangements. Ironically, the first identified NK cell receptors inhibit NK cell activation and specifically recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules that otherwise can activate T cells. Recently, we showed that the MHC-specific NK cell receptors have another function presumably during NK cell development; they can engage self-MHC molecules and endow an individual NK cell with the capacity to be stimulated through its activation receptors.  Other studies showed that NK cell activation receptors can specifically recognize virus-infected cells, providing the genetic basis for the vital role of NK cells during the earliest phases of immune responses. Thus, our studies have led to an appreciation of NK cell specificity in host defense against infections and tumors.I have had a long-standing interest in immunology, the study of the body's defense against infections and tumors.

VAs a structural biologist, I have been focusing on protein biosynthesis mechanisms, using ribosomal crystallography, a research line pioneered by my research team in the beginning of the eighties. We identified eubacterial ribosomes crystallizable under conditions allowing optimal functional activity, which yielded complete high-resolution structures of functionally relevant conformations of both ribosomal subunits. Consequently we discovered a sizable symmetry related region within the otherwise asymmetric ribosome, and revealed the parameters crucial for precise substrates placement. A thorough analysis confirmed that the ribosome contributes positional catalysis to its dual tasks: peptide bond formation and aminoacid polymerization. We discovered the unified ribosomal machinery for peptide-bond formation, translocation and nascent protein progression into their exit tunnel. This tunnel, visualized by us in the mid-eighties, is one of the main targets for antibiotics. As we are focusing on species proved to be suitable pathogen models, we elucidated modes of action of over twenty different antibiotics, belonging to a dozen different antibiotic-families, all complexed with ribosomes at clinically relevant concentrations. Further analysis provided the structural bases for antibiotics synergism, clarified antibiotics selectivity and illuminated resistance mechanisms, thus paving the way for structural based drug design. We also identified structural elements allowing the tunnel's dynamic, thus enabling ribosomal involvement in discrimination and intra-cellular regulation.As a structural biologist, I have been focusing on protein biosynthesis mechanisms, using ribosomal crystallography, a research line pioneered by my research team in the beginning of the eighties.

VWe explore the activities of certain genes that control circadian (daily) rhythms in Drosophila. Screens in our laboratory have identified six genes that are essential to the running of the fly circadian clock. Interactions among these genes, and their proteins, contribute to a network of molecular oscillations within single cells. These ~24 hour oscillations are autonomously generated in a variety of tissues of the fly. Although an association of behavioral rhythms and circadian clocks has been recognized for several decades, our studies show that these clocks also establish rhythmic patterns of gene expression that affect many other facets of physiology and cell biology. The genetic mechanism underlying circadian clocks is conserved within the animal kingdom. So much so that we now appreciate that "clock" genes originally detected in Drosophila regulate patterns of sleep and other rhythms in humans. We are currently studying regulated subcellular movements of some clock proteins that may set the period length of circadian rhythms. We have also begun a study of mutations that alter the duration or timing of rest in Drosophila.We explore the activities of certain genes that control circadian (daily) rhythms in Drosophila.

Breeding of two line (PGMS line and TGMS line) system hybrid rice to develop inter-sub specific (indica/japonica) hybrids with stronger heterosis.  2. To develop super hybrid rice varieties (yield potential above 13.5 t/ha) by conventional breeding method plus biotechnology. 3. Study the genetic basis of rice heterosis at molecular level.As a plant breeder, I have been engaging in hybrid rice breeding for more than 40 years.

VFor over 20 years I have dissected how the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens can genetically transform plant cells. The insights derived include fundamental discoveries in plant microbe communication, interkingdom conjugal DNA transfer, plant nuclear localization, and type IV bacterial secretion. Understanding this DNA transfer process led to the design of modified versions of Agrobacterium capable of transferring any DNA of interest to plant cells and the ensuing application to basic research and agricultural biotechnology. Two additional topics are under study. Plant cells are encased in cell walls so individual cells to not touch. Plasmodesmata are membrane-lined channels that span plant cell walls, linking the cytoplasm between adjacent cells. Plasmodesmata fluctuate in aperture, impacting general plant development and defense against pathogens. Plant viruses pirate these channels for intercellular spread during infection and are useful molecular probes for plasmodesmata function.   I also study the temporal regulation of plasmodesmata in particular cells and tissues during development, thereby exposing networks of intercellular traffic for micro- and macromolecules. Finally, we use molecular, genetic, and cell biological approaches to analyze genes essential for female reproductive development in Arabidopsis.For over 20 years I have dissected how the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens can genetically transform plant cells.

VAs a plant geneticist, my research interests have been in genetics and biotechnology of rice. My group has characterized the genetic components controlling heterosis in an elite rice hybrid. Using an "immortalized F2 population" that I designed, we identified heterotic QTL and found coexistence of dominance, overdominance and prevalent epistasis in the system, and demonstrated that heterotic effects at the single-locus level in combination with the advantageous effects of double heterozygotes could explain the genetic basis of heterosis in this hybrid. My group has also systematically conducted functional characterization of the rice genome, and identified over 100 rice genes (QTLs) by molecular mapping and T-DNA insertion mutant library screening. More than 10 agronomically important genes have been molecularly cloned and characterized, including GS3 the first gene identified for grain size (a trait for both grain yield and quality), and xa13 a recessively inherited disease resistant gene. My group has also made large efforts in rice genetic improvement by integrating germplasms, molecular marker assisted selection and transgenics in rice breeding, and developed lines with improved disease resistance, insect resistance and grain quality, some of which have been used in rice production in China.As a plant geneticist, my research interests have been in genetics and biotechnology of rice.

VI have studied neural development using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model. We have identified genes controlling different aspects neural development from early patterning genes regulating retinal specification, to genes regulating the formation of neural circuits. In more recent studies, we have used a combination of genetic and biochemical studies to uncover the function of a large family of cell surface proteins encoded by the Dscam1 locus in regulating neural circuit assembly in the fly nervous system. Dscam proteins are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell recognition molecules. Through alternative splicing, the Dscam1 locus is predicted to encode 19,008 different extracellular domains or isoforms. These proteins exhibit isoform-specific homophilic binding; isoforms on one membrane bind selectively to the same isoform on an opposing membrane. Binding elicits a repulsive response. As each neuron expresses a unique Dscam1 signature, this family of proteins prevents inappropriate association between processes of the same cell. This "self avoidance" plays an essential role in patterning neural circuits throughout the fly nervous system.I have studied neural development using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model.

VMy general fields of activities are: Information Theory and Statistical Theory of Communications. In particular, I have been involved in establishing a variety of "universal" Information-theoretic results for cases where the statistics of the message sequences which are transmitted via a communication channel are unknown or do not exist( the individual sequence approach), and where the probabilistic laws that govern the (noisy) communication channel are unknown.  This theoretical approach led to complexity measures for individual sequences, efficient universal data compression algorithms, universal channel decoding algorithms, and efficient universal prediction and classification algorithms.  I was also involved with early versions of concatenated error correcting codes and a variety of bounds on the border-line between information theory and statistical communication theory as well as bounds on multi-user communication problems in Information Theory.My general fields of activities are: Information Theory and Statistical Theory of Communications.

VMy research centers on the nervous system, in development and disease. One branch of my lab is unraveling the molecular pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxias that are caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the disease-causing proteins that interferes with protein folding and degradation; in both fly and mouse models of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), we have shown that increasing chaperone activity can mitigate the neurodegenerative phenotype. We are currently studying mouse models of several different SCAs in hopes of gaining insight into the molecular ramifications of protein accumulation and identifying molecular targets that could lead to safe therapies. My lab also studies Math1 (mouse atonal homologue 1), which governs the development of many components of the proprioceptive pathway. We are trying to identify Math1's downstream targets to better grasp how one gene can control the fate of such divergent cell types as cerebellar granule neurons, inner ear hair cells, and intestinal secretory cells. Finally, we are investigating how mutations in the transcriptional repressor MeCP2 cause Rett syndrome and autistic spectrum disorders. We are using mouse models that either lack or over-express MeCP2 to identify MeCP2 targets and determine how MeCP2 influences synaptic plasticity, allowing the acquisition of motor, language, and social skills.My research centers on the nervous system, in development and disease.

During the last ten years the focus of my work has been on the interface between quantum optics and quantum information, and condensed matter physics with cold atoms. Examples are proposals for quantum computing with cold trapped ions, with cavity quantum electrodynamics, and cold atoms and molecules in optical lattices, the quantum repeater for quantum communication with atomic ensembles, and atomic physics - solid state interfaces and hybrid systems. Furthermore, we proposed the engineering of Hubbard models with quantum degenerate gases of atoms in optical lattices as a quantum simulator for strongly interacting many body systems and exotic quantum phases, and we have recently extended these ideas to cold molecules.My interest and expertise are in the field of theoretical quantum optics, in particular the description of interaction of light with matter, and various aspects of quantum noise.

VMy research addresses the structure and evolution of solid planetary bodies through combination of theory, observation and computation. In early work I modeled tectonic structures on planetary surfaces using viscoplastic instability theory to infer thermomechanical properties of shallow interiors and to estimate stress states. I analyzed rifts and folds on Venus, Earth and Mars to reconstruct interior thermal profiles and subsurface structure at the time of feature formation. Several broad collaborations later resulted in experiments to map the topography and gravity fields of the Moon, Mars and asteroid 433 Eros, and from the combined data sets we developed the first reliable global models of the internal structures of these bodies. Our work revealed the crustal structure beneath major lunar impact basins, and allowed us to show that the Moon cooled off more rapidly after accretion than had previously been thought. On Mars we demonstrated that the planet contained two crustal provinces that do not correlate with surface geology, and showed the origin of the prominent Tharsis rise to be a consequence of volcanic construction. For Eros we showed that the asteroid was characterized by a strikingly homogeneous interior and we mapped the thickness of the impact-generated regolith.My research addresses the structure and evolution of solid planetary bodies through combination of theory, observation and computation.

VMy research focuses on elucidating mechanisms of signal transduction and information coding in sensory systems. Initially, I focused on phototransduction and photoreceptor cell function in Drosophila melanogaster. Those studies produced a reasonably comprehensive dissection of a complex signaling pathway, and defined most of the components involved in the phototransduction cascade. More recently, my laboratory began a genetic dissection of mechanosensory transduction in flies as a strategy to characterize the molecular machinery responsible for our senses of hearing, balance and propioception. This work resulted in the discovery of one of the principal eukaryotic mechanically gated ion channels, and validated TRP channels as transduction channels for the mechanical senses. Beginning in 1998, we started to work on the biology of mammalian taste. Studies in collaboration with Nick Ryba at the NIH led to the discovery of the receptors for sweet, bitter and umami taste. Our labs then demonstrated that the different taste modalities are encoded independently of each other, and proved that taste receptor cells are "hardwired" to mediate dedicated behavioral outputs: "sweet-cells" mediate attraction, while "bitter-cells" mediate aversion. Thus, animals engineered to express a bitter taste receptor in sweet-cells display attraction to the bitter tastant. Indeed, expression of a novel receptor for a normally tasteless compound in either sweet- or bitter-cells produces mice with could be attracted or aversed to the compound, depending on the taste cell type.My research focuses on elucidating mechanisms of signal transduction and information coding in sensory systems.
